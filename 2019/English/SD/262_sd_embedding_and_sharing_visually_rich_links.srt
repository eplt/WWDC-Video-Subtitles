00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:08,306
>> Hi, I'm Tim Horton from the


3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,646
Safari and WebKit Team.


4
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:11,706
I'm here to show you how to


5
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:13,516
present rich links in your app.


6
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:17,306
In iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, we


7
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:18,546
introduced rich links in


8
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,376
messages as a way to make URLs


9
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:23,396
more beautiful and more useful.


10
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,506
In order to maximize the


11
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:25,356
benefit, we built


12
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:26,676
specializations for certain


13
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,326
kinds of links.


14
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:30,176
This includes things like inline


15
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:31,446
video and audio playback, a


16
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,756
special presentation for Tweets


17
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:35,296
including those with multiple


18
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,286
images and many other things


19
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:38,556
like Apple Maps links.


20
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:45,276
This year iOS 13 and macOS 10.15


21
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,166
bring new APIs that allow you to


22
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,686
present rich links in your own


23
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:50,516
apps so that you get those same


24
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:51,946
benefits with a minimal amount


25
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:52,356
of work.


26
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:54,686
In this video, we're going to


27
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,586
follow the development of this


28
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:58,356
very simple recipe book marking


29
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,566
app as we progressively adopt


30
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,866
features of the new link


31
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,596
presentation framework to go


32
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,525
from a bland list of URLs to a


33
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,686
rich grid of links like this in


34
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:08,376
no time at all.


35
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:11,716
To achieve this I'm going to


36
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:13,326
cover 3 topics.


37
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,296
First, how to present metadata


38
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,296
given a URL.


39
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,096
Second, how to easily present


40
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,586
that metadata to the user.


41
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:23,506
And third, how to use fetched


42
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:24,966
metadata to accelerate the


43
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,396
presentation of the new Share


44
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:28,806
Sheet experience in iOS 13.


45
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:31,986
So let's start with retrieving


46
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:32,416
metadata.


47
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,276
In the recipe app, let's say


48
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,546
that you already have some


49
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:39,496
mechanism for users to get URLs


50
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:40,226
into the app.


51
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,496
You could just present them in a


52
00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:44,556
table and call it quits, but


53
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,046
URLs are not very user-friendly


54
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:47,666
and in this case, it's quite


55
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,846
hard to distinguish between


56
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:48,966
them.


57
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:51,326
You could instead ask the user


58
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,936
for a title for each link, but


59
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,266
we can make it even easier.


60
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,686
Using the new link presentation


61
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,936
framework it's very easy to use


62
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,286
the LP metadata provider class


63
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:04,376
to retrieve rich metadata from


64
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:04,926
the website.


65
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,646
You just pass it the URL and it


66
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:10,026
returns you an LPLinkMetadata


67
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,836
object with a representative


68
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,596
title in any media that is


69
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:14,066
available.


70
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:17,256
Let's see what this looks like.


71
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,376
First you create an


72
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:22,266
LPMetadataProvider and then call


73
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,956
startFetchingMetadata with the


74
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:26,786
URL you're interested in.


75
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:27,936
When the completion handler is


76
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,336
called, be sure to check the


77
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:29,766
error.


78
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,056
If the server doesn't respond or


79
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,296
is too slow or your user doesn't


80
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,436
have a network connection, the


81
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,456
metadata fetched can fail.


82
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,396
Finally, you use the metadata


83
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,346
for whatever you want.


84
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,936
We'll come back to this in a


85
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:43,306
moment.


86
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,456
Before we continue there are a


87
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,136
few things to keep in mind when


88
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,966
using metadataProvider and


89
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,226
LinkMetadata.


90
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,436
First, the resultant metadata


91
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,906
object can include any of a


92
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:58,166
title, icon, image or video or


93
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,376
none at all if the site doesn't


94
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,086
specify any.


95
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,726
It is also serializable within a


96
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:03,526
secure coding.


97
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,356
This is important because


98
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:06,946
LPMetadataProvider hits the


99
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,766
Internet to do its job and you


100
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,606
don't want to do that work nor


101
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,916
make your users pay that data


102
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,076
and performance cost every time


103
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:15,246
you present the same link.


104
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:16,966
You should cache retrieved


105
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,726
metadata locally as much as


106
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:19,306
possible.


107
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:23,056
Also, you can fetch metadata for


108
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,486
local file URLs in which case


109
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:26,996
the new QuickLook thumbnailing


110
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:29,316
API will be used to retrieve a


111
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,656
representative thumbnail for the


112
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:31,716
file, if possible.


113
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,296
Now let's talk about how to put


114
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,136
the metadata we retrieve to use


115
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,546
by presenting it in our app.


116
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:40,996
Once again, it's


117
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:41,696
straightforward.


118
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,176
You can just take the object


119
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:44,706
from earlier and create an


120
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,726
LPLinkView with it.


121
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,256
It's that simple.


122
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,506
Let's return to the recipe app


123
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,366
and put LPLinkViews inside our


124
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,366
table view cells.


125
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,486
Much better.


126
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:00,226
Now you have a very familiar


127
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,586
presentation that makes each


128
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,146
recipe easy to identify at a


129
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,836
glance.


130
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,476
LPLinkView has an intrinsic


131
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,556
size, but it also responds to


132
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,726
size that fits with the ideal


133
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,486
size to use given a constraining


134
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,586
size and we'll try to present


135
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:15,806
something reasonable when laid


136
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,486
out at any size.


137
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,065
The last thing I'm going to talk


138
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,416
about is how to make use of


139
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,366
LinkMetadata to accelerate the


140
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,776
presentation of the new Share


141
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,966
Sheet experience in iOS 13.


142
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:29,946
For existing apps that share


143
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:31,426
URLs, the Share Sheet will


144
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:32,786
automatically present a preview


145
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:33,716
of the link at the top of the


146
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:34,196
card.


147
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,706
However, this requires reaching


148
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:37,946
out to the server to retrieve


149
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,966
metadata once the Share Sheet is


150
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:40,546
presented.


151
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,536
So the title and icon show up


152
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,406
asynchronously.


153
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,596
Let's watch that again.


154
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,556
Keep a close eye on the Share


155
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:48,256
Sheet's header.


156
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:52,606
If you already have an


157
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,846
LPLinkMetadata object for URL,


158
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,596
you should just pass it to the


159
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,266
Share Sheet and the preview will


160
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,836
appear instantly without loading


161
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:00,506
from the network.


162
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,266
You can use the new


163
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:04,136
activityViewControllerLink


164
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,826
Metadata method on your


165
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:06,626
implementation of


166
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,276
UIActivityItemSource and just


167
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,816
return the metadata object.


168
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:13,386
Let's look at the difference in


169
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,816
our recipe app if we provide the


170
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,196
data that we already use in the


171
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:16,686
table view.


172
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,056
Much nicer.


173
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,706
It's also good to note that if


174
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:22,966
the user chooses to share to


175
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:25,046
messages the same metadata is


176
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:26,196
passed directly through


177
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,826
providing a smooth and seamless


178
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,616
experience with no unnecessary


179
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:29,966
loading.


180
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:31,846
One last thing.


181
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:33,976
Say your app already has a


182
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,776
database of recipes with titles


183
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,206
and images that weren't fetched


184
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,226
by linked presentation.


185
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,356
You don't have to re-fetch the


186
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,056
metadata from the Internet in


187
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:43,216
order to accelerate the Share


188
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,986
Sheet or to present a rich link.


189
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,216
Instead, you can just fill in


190
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,696
the fields of LPLinkMetadata


191
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,696
yourself from your pre-existing


192
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:51,406
source of data.


193
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,436
You simply create an


194
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,706
LPLinkMetadata object and fill


195
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:57,496
in at least the original URL and


196
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:59,396
URL fields plus whatever


197
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,366
additional information you have.


198
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,346
So our 3 key takeaways today are


199
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:07,946
you can use LP metadata provider


200
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,286
to fetch rich metadata for URL


201
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,366
in order to provide more context


202
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,796
about arbitrary URLs.


203
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,026
You should use LP link view to


204
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,716
present links in your app in a


205
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,116
way that is both beautiful and


206
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,156
consistent with the system and


207
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,366
you should prefetch or use


208
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,216
existing LPLinkMetadata to


209
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,506
accelerate the Share Sheet


210
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:26,486
preview in your app.


211
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,106
