00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,036
>> Hello, and welcome to our


3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:11,006
session about Modernizing Your


4
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:11,496
Audio App.


5
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,246
My name is Peter Vasil, and I'm


6
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:15,886
a software engineer in the Core


7
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:16,486
Audio Team.


8
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,296
Let's start with audio units.


9
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,276
Support for


10
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:23,856
Carbon-Component-Based Audio


11
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,736
Units will be removed in a


12
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:27,166
future macOS release.


13
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,926
We encourage hosts to use the


14
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,826
AudioComponent API for audio


15
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:32,866
unit discovery.


16
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:36,936
With the next OS release,


17
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:38,676
AudioHardwarePlugIn-based


18
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:41,326
plugins are disabled by default.


19
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,556
We recommend using the


20
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,766
AudioServerPlugin API instead.


21
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,676
For now, disabled plugins can be


22
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,346
re-enabled in the Audio MIDI


23
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:53,406
Setup utility, but support will


24
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,766
be removed completely in a


25
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,226
future macOS release.


26
00:00:56,716 --> 00:01:00,236
With the next OS release, we


27
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,256
will introduce some


28
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:02,136
deprecations.


29
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,126
AUGraph, Inter-App Audio, and


30
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:07,076
OpenAL will be deprecated.


31
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,326
We encourage developers to


32
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,746
switch over to AVAudioEngine, as


33
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,586
replacement for AUGraph and


34
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:14,376
OpenAL.


35
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,566
For Inter-App Audio, please use


36
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,646
Audio Unit Extensions instead.


37
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:22,996
The 3D Mixer parameters have


38
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,426
been unified across all


39
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,206
platforms.


40
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,946
For details, please refer to the


41
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:30,166
AudioUnitParameters header file


42
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,216
for a list of new and deprecated


43
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,006
parameters.


44
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:35,786
For more information, please


45
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:37,426
visit the developer website.


46
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:40,696
Thank you for your attention.
