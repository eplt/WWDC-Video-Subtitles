00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:09,376
>> Hello, and welcome to


2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,626
debugging in Xcode 11.


3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,186
I'm Chris Miles, one of the


4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,306
engineering managers on the


5
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,006
Xcode team.


6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,386
I'm really excited to be here


7
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:15,616
today.


8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:16,746
We've got a lot of great stuff


9
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,396
to get through, so I'm going to


10
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,886
jump straight in and start by


11
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,236
telling you about device


12
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:22,816
conditions and environment


13
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:23,446
overrides.


14
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:25,806
So, you may have received


15
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,306
reports from users where your


16
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,336
app isn't behaving as expected


17
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:30,906
under certain real-world


18
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,516
conditions, and they may be the


19
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,756
types of conditions that are


20
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,816
really hard to replicate in your


21
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:36,746
development environment.


22
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,266
Such as real-world networking


23
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:39,866
conditions.


24
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,866
Network response out in the real


25
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,776
world isn't always as ideal as


26
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,276
it is in our home or office


27
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,166
where we typically build our


28
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:46,516
apps.


29
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,306
And if users report an issue


30
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,426
while using your app in


31
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,566
situations where network


32
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,006
connectivity is limited, you


33
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:54,956
need a way to reliably reproduce


34
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:55,986
these types of network


35
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,746
conditions to debug and improve


36
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,076
your app.


37
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,106
Or, when devices out in the real


38
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:02,756
world are under thermal pressure


39
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:05,215
and need to regulate resources


40
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,856
available to your app in order


41
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:08,356
to help cool down the device.


42
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:09,826
You need to understand how your


43
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:11,566
app behaves in these types of


44
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,406
thermal conditions and for apps


45
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,566
that make heavy use of


46
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:15,946
resources, you may be


47
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:17,236
proactively responding to


48
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,806
thermal state changes by


49
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,096
reducing resource usage when the


50
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,466
device is under thermal


51
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:22,776
pressure.


52
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:24,896
But how do you reliably put the


53
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:26,786
device into an elevated thermal


54
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,776
state in order to debug and


55
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:29,746
verify your logic?


56
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:31,836
And this is where device


57
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:32,676
conditions come in.


58
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,646
New in Xcode 11, you're able to


59
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,866
use the new thermal state


60
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,096
condition to safely and reliably


61
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:40,626
raise the thermal state of a


62
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:42,136
device to any of the elevated


63
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,966
levels, fair, serious, or


64
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:44,406
critical.


65
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,166
You can use this to understand


66
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,946
your app's behavior under these


67
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,976
elevated thermal states, and to


68
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,746
debug and verify your handling


69
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,166
of thermal state changes.


70
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,136
Just note the device does not


71
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,346
actually get physically warmer,


72
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:57,686
so don't use this functionality


73
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,256
to try and warm your hands on a


74
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:00,616
cold day.


75
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:01,806
Along with the thermal state


76
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:02,796
condition, we also have the


77
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:03,946
network link condition.


78
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,976
This allows you to simulate


79
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:07,786
real-world networking conditions


80
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:09,556
directly from Xcode on that


81
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,606
device, such as a high latency,


82
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:14,016
low bandwidth, high packet loss,


83
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:14,766
and slow DNS.


84
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,366
So you can use this to


85
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,566
understand and debug your app's


86
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,456
behavior under these various


87
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,646
networking conditions.


88
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,316
Now this functionality is


89
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,476
similar to the network link


90
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,646
conditioner in iOS developer


91
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,986
settings that some of you may be


92
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,526
already familiar with, but it


93
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,266
has been updated with a wider


94
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,626
range of modern network


95
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,436
profiles, and it's fully


96
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,386
controllable by Xcode, and I'll


97
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,526
show you how that works in a few


98
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,006
moments.


99
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:41,166
Now, some conditions that an app


100
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,176
must adapt to are controlled by


101
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:43,636
the user.


102
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,516
There are numerous settings that


103
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,586
a user can adjust in order to


104
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,166
customize their interface, such


105
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,106
as the light or dark interface


106
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,916
style that an app is running in.


107
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,796
In iOS 13, your app must provide


108
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:58,576
a great user experience when


109
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,356
running in either light or dark.


110
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,276
A setting that is highly


111
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,436
customizable is dynamic type.


112
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:07,996
Users can choose between very


113
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,256
small dynamic type sizes up to


114
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:12,366
very large sizes, and there are


115
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,206
even larger sizes available in


116
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,546
the accessibility settings.


117
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,726
So you need to be able to debug


118
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,916
your UI layout across a wide


119
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,976
range of dynamic type settings.


120
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,906
And then there are many


121
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,326
accessibility options available


122
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:26,756
as well.


123
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,636
Many system controls already


124
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:30,096
adapt to these settings, but you


125
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,556
need to ensure that your custom


126
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,446
views and controls also do the


127
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,136
right thing when these settings


128
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:35,646
are enabled.


129
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:37,646
As you can see here, there's a


130
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,546
large matrix of environment


131
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,956
settings available to users.


132
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,716
Do you debug and test your app


133
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:43,826
with many of these settings


134
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,996
adjusted or enabled?


135
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,696
Do you even remember where to


136
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,076
find many of these settings?


137
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,726
And this is where environment


138
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,336
overrides can really help,


139
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,016
allowing you to effortlessly


140
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,526
override any combination of


141
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,056
these settings while debugging


142
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,666
your app directly from Xcode.


143
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,396
That's a quick introduction into


144
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:01,286
device conditions and


145
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:02,416
environment overrides, but I'd


146
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,456
love to show you how they work,


147
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,356
and I'm going to do that by


148
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,906
jumping into Xcode.


149
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:10,116
So here we have Xcode open with


150
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,056
the Trouble Project.


151
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:12,316
This is an iOS app that we've


152
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,016
been building that allows users


153
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,576
to discover places to travel to,


154
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:17,315
create a travel plan, and record


155
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,026
a travel journey.


156
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,266
You may have seen it from some


157
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,716
of our other sessions this week.


158
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,536
I've been focusing on this


159
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,016
beautiful 3D rendering of the


160
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,496
Earth here with pins in it


161
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,096
indicating places to travel to.


162
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:30,036
Now, I want this app to be a


163
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,746
good thermal citizen, and so


164
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,526
I've started adding code to


165
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,136
observe thermal state changes on


166
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,586
the device, and I'd like to


167
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,776
reduce the use of GPU resources


168
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:40,276
when the device is under thermal


169
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:40,606
pressure.


170
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,466
So, let me show you how I've


171
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:42,816
done that.


172
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:44,716
I'm going to switch to this


173
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,026
Globe Scene Controller.


174
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,166
This is the controller


175
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,466
responsible for configuring the


176
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,226
3D scene.


177
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,446
In the initializer, you can see


178
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:52,976
that I've added an observer for


179
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,346
the thermal state did change


180
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,026
notification.


181
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:56,546
This is called whenever the


182
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,726
thermal state of the device


183
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:58,256
changes.


184
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,356
In the callback, we call through


185
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,946
to configure scene features.


186
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,186
So let's take a look at this


187
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:03,556
function.


188
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,426
It's responsible for two


189
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,446
parameters of our 3D scene, the


190
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:08,816
anti-aliasing mode and the


191
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:09,836
requested frame rate.


192
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,116
So when this is called, we can


193
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,306
fetch the thermal state of the


194
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,356
device, and then when the device


195
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,766
is in the critical thermal


196
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,706
state, the recommendation is to


197
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,556
reduce our use of energy


198
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,446
impactful resources as much as


199
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,826
possible to help the device cool


200
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:24,116
down.


201
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:25,776
So, in our case, what I'm going


202
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,226
to do is to turn off


203
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,716
anti-aliasing and also to reduce


204
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:30,816
our frame rate to 30.


205
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,076
In the serious thermal state, we


206
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,186
don't have to be as aggressive,


207
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:36,426
so let's just turn off


208
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:37,996
anti-aliasing but leave the


209
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,166
frame rate as it is, and in the


210
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,266
lower thermal states, we don't


211
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,466
have to take any action in this


212
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,306
particular case.


213
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:45,636
So with that change in place,


214
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,106
I'm going to stop and rerun, and


215
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,266
I have a device next to me, and


216
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,326
I'm mirroring that device back


217
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:51,796
to the desktop using QuickTime


218
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:52,906
player on the right.


219
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,746
Now what I'd like to do is to


220
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,036
put the device into the critical


221
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:57,286
thermal state, so we can test


222
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:58,566
this logic and debug it if there


223
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,096
are any problems, and so I can


224
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,216
use the new device conditions


225
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:01,736
for that.


226
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,566
But before I do that, I'd also


227
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,676
like to monitor the thermal


228
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:06,536
state of this device, and I can


229
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,196
do that now by switching to the


230
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:09,636
debug navigator and selecting


231
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,366
the energy impact gauge.


232
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,456
This gauge shows you a breakdown


233
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,476
of the average energy impact as


234
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,136
well as the component


235
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:19,466
utilization here on the top


236
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,756
right, and you can see as I


237
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,996
interact with the app the GPU is


238
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,256
the primary component in this


239
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,116
case, as expected.


240
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,256
But I'm going to draw your


241
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:28,536
attention to the middle here


242
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,086
where we have the new thermal


243
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,616
state track available in Xcode


244
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,046
11.


245
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,596
This shows you two pieces of


246
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,156
information.


247
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:35,616
The top of the track shows you


248
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:36,856
whether any device conditions


249
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,326
are active, and there are no


250
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:39,546
device conditions active yet.


251
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,176
The bottom part shows you the


252
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:42,196
current thermal state of the


253
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:42,646
device.


254
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,096
And blue indicates the nominal


255
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,226
thermal state, everything is


256
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,246
running cool and smoothly.


257
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,986
So let's leave that open while I


258
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:50,386
use the window menu to open the


259
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,236
devices window.


260
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:53,146
I'll move that up here.


261
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,936
Now, with the device selected,


262
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,186
we can scroll to the bottom and


263
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:57,566
find the new device conditions


264
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:57,796
UI.


265
00:06:58,756 --> 00:06:59,666
And here we can see all the


266
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,476
device conditions available for


267
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,136
this device.


268
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:03,416
We have the network link


269
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,786
condition and all the new


270
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:05,976
profiles available.


271
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:07,816
In our case, let's select


272
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:08,706
thermal state.


273
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,276
And here we can choose an


274
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,686
elevated thermal state level,


275
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,716
and I'm going to choose critical


276
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:13,836
and press start.


277
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,326
Now, there's a few things to


278
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,056
take note of here.


279
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:17,196
One is that it takes a few


280
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:18,176
moments for the device to


281
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,686
transition to the critical


282
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,416
thermal state, and down here in


283
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,256
the thermal state track, we see


284
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,636
confirmation that that device


285
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,326
condition is now active, and


286
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,536
after a few moments, you can see


287
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:29,786
that the device transitioned to


288
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,736
the critical thermal state.


289
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:33,206
Over here on the right, on the


290
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,776
device itself, note in the top


291
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:36,946
there's a background filler on


292
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,186
the time, and that's you status


293
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,926
bar indicator that a device


294
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,396
condition is active on this


295
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:41,916
device.


296
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,856
Now, finally, if we interact


297
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,366
with our 3D scene, we can see


298
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,626
that the frame rate indicator


299
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,306
that we've added shows 30 frames


300
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:49,786
per second.


301
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,696
And so we can verify easily as


302
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:52,896
that, that our logic is doing


303
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:53,386
the right thing.


304
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,166
Also, the anti-aliasing is


305
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:55,656
switched off.


306
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:56,786
It's a little hard to see on


307
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,056
this small device, but on a


308
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,336
larger device, you'd be able to


309
00:07:59,336 --> 00:07:59,746
see that.


310
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:01,306
So now that we've used device


311
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,306
conditions to verify our code,


312
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,576
we can switch it off.


313
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,386
I could press the stop button


314
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,266
here, but there are a couple of


315
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,746
other ways to disable the device


316
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:09,196
condition.


317
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:11,166
One, is to disconnect that


318
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,086
device from Xcode or quit Xcode.


319
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,316
If the device ever comes


320
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:16,026
disconnected from Xcode, it will


321
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,416
automatically tear down a device


322
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,336
condition, because we don't want


323
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,276
to leave your device running in


324
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,366
one of these states when you're


325
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,016
not developing.


326
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,376
Another is on the device itself,


327
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,816
we can tap that status bar


328
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,956
indicator at the top, which I'll


329
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:27,986
do now, and we'll see


330
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:29,176
information about the currently


331
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,476
active condition, and I can


332
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,176
press the stop button to turn


333
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:32,866
off that condition.


334
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:33,946
So, I'll press that now.


335
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,996
We can close the devices window,


336
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,696
and in the thermal state track


337
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:39,976
here, we see confirmation that


338
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,456
the device condition is no


339
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,076
longer active, and we can see


340
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:44,416
that the device starts


341
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,706
transitioning back down to the


342
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:47,056
fair thermal state and the


343
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:47,976
nominal thermal state.


344
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:53,106
[ Applause ]


345
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:54,626
So that's a quick example of


346
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:55,936
using the device conditions, in


347
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,926
this case the thermal state


348
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:57,986
condition on our connected


349
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:58,406
device.


350
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,586
Now, I'd like to move on and


351
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,316
show you environment overrides.


352
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,216
Now what I'm going to do is stop


353
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:05,586
running and switch to a


354
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,436
particular view.


355
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,776
I'm going to choose profile


356
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:08,026
view.


357
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:10,426
This is written in Swift UI, and


358
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,146
I really, really like writing


359
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:15,056
Swift UI and using the new Xcode


360
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:15,456
preview.


361
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,806
So I'm going to open the canvas


362
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,326
to start the preview engine.


363
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,366
Now, I don't need the device


364
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,166
anymore, so I'll close


365
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:21,616
QuickTime.


366
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,196
Previews will start up.


367
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:25,636
Now, to use environment


368
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:26,896
overrides, you need to be


369
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,246
debugging your app or debugging


370
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,916
your preview, and if you haven't


371
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,456
seen already, you can debug


372
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:34,216
previews by control clicking on


373
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,646
the live button down on the


374
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,136
bottom right.


375
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,596
You'll see a pop-up menu, and


376
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:38,496
you can just choose debug


377
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:38,916
preview.


378
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,716
This does two things.


379
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:42,756
It puts the preview into live


380
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,656
mode, and it also attaches a


381
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:45,306
debug session.


382
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,166
So, now the preview is live and


383
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,726
interactive, and here we go down


384
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:52,756
the bottom, which I'll lift up a


385
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:52,946
bit.


386
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,966
In the debug bar, we can see


387
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,766
that we have confirmation that


388
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,016
we have a debug session active


389
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:58,886
debugging the preview.


390
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,536
So we have all of our usual


391
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,596
debugging tools, such as view


392
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:02,526
debugging, memory graft


393
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,006
debugging, and the new


394
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,146
environment overrides.


395
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:07,196
So, if I click that, we see the


396
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:09,616
environment overrides UI, and we


397
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,946
can simply override the


398
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,646
interface style by clicking the


399
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,246
switch, and now we've put that


400
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,766
preview into dark mode.


401
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,196
We can just switch back and


402
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:18,626
forth between light and dark to


403
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,296
test our layout and test our UI.


404
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:21,906
So, you might have already


405
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:22,646
noticed an issue.


406
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,166
The description text here looks


407
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,316
great in light, but in dark, we


408
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,146
can't even see it.


409
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,246
So, while we're here, let's take


410
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:29,796
a quick look.


411
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,596
This text element under my


412
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,356
cursor is responsible for


413
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,046
drawing the description, and you


414
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,126
can see that I haven't finished


415
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,836
transitioning this view to take


416
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:38,676
advantage of dark mode.


417
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:39,786
I'm still using a fixed color.


418
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,376
I should use a semantic color


419
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:42,326
like secondary, so I'll make


420
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:42,916
that change.


421
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:44,616
What I love about previews,


422
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:45,886
refreshes for me.


423
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:47,246
Because we have asked for


424
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,416
debugging, we still have a debug


425
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,776
session, so I can bring up


426
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:50,886
environment overrides and look


427
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:52,276
at dark mode, and we've made our


428
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:52,976
fix as easy as that.


429
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:57,996
[ Applause ]


430
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,726
Let's try out the dynamic type


431
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,216
override.


432
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,786
I'll switch on text overrides.


433
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,946
I can simply use this slider to


434
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,396
choose any of the dynamic type


435
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:06,786
settings down to the very


436
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:09,386
smallest, up to the very


437
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,636
largest, and then we can keep


438
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,076
going into the accessibility


439
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,506
sizes, all the way up to the


440
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,966
very largest accessibility


441
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,366
dynamic type size.


442
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:19,406
Notice that our layout is pretty


443
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,916
good in this case except here.


444
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,616
These little rectangles get


445
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,006
clicked in the very largest type


446
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:24,506
sizes.


447
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:25,816
So, while we're here, let's fix


448
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:26,216
that too.


449
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,116
I'm going to scroll down to


450

00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:30,616
responsible for drawing these


452
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:31,276
rectangles.


453
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,676
It lays out an image and a text


454
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:34,526
in a horizontal stack.


455
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,846
What I'd like us to do is when


456
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,976
the type size gets too large, to


457
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:40,156
switch that to a vertical stack


458
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,286
and lay them out one above the


459
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:41,486
other.


460
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:42,976
Now, I've had to solve this


461
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,646
elsewhere, and I build a custom


462
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:45,936
view called an adapting stack.


463
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,786
I'm going to option click that


464
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:51,026
now to open that, and we don't


465
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,906
need the canvas in this case, so


466
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:53,836
I'll close that.


467
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:54,746
So we've opened this


468
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,756
in an editor split, and let's take a


469
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:57,216
quick look.


470
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,826
An adapting stack is a custom


471
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,486
view that takes a view builder


472
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,366
closer as an import, the same as


473
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,836
an Hstack or a Vstack does.


474
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,826
It binds itself to the size


475
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,676
category environment.


476
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:08,276
And so when a size category


477
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,436
changes, which is what happens


478
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,446
when you change dynamic type,


479
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,276
our bodies fold, and then if we


480
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:13,636
switch on size category, if it's


481
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:15,326
accessibility large or larger,


482
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:16,846
then we wrap the content in a


483
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,536
vertical stack and adjust some


484
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:18,876
padding.


485
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:20,126
Otherwise, we wrap it in a


486
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:20,766
horizontal stack.


487
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:22,876
So, let's try this one out.


488
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,836
I'll change this H stack to an


489
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:29,606
adapting stack.


490
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:32,026
Our preview will refresh for us,


491
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,966
and now we can try out our


492
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:35,846
environment overrides.


493
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,986
And now, as we go into the large


494
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:40,136
sizes, we can see that our


495
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:40,946
layout adapts.

We don't have time to play with

00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,366
them today, but I highly


504
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,106
encourage you to try out all

511
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,526
So let me give you just a quick


512
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:10,966
summary of what I showed you.


513
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,066
First, we looked at device


514
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,236
conditions, which is available


515
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:14,476
from the devices window.


516
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,476
It allows you to enable a


517
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,476
network link condition or a


518
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:20,586
thermal state condition.


519
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:23,326
Device conditions are tied to


520
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,226
the Xcode device connection.


521
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:26,226
So if the device becomes


522
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,746
disconnected from Xcode, we


523
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:29,026
automatically tear down that


524
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:29,836
device condition.


525
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,626
And in iOS status bar indicator,


526
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,506
it is your indication that a


527
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,066
device condition is active on


528
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:35,576
that device.


529
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,196
You can tap that indicator to

00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,426
see details about the condition


531
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,316
and use it to stop the


532
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:39,766
condition.

00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,066
You can use to instantly


536
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,736
override many of the settings


537
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,326
that you saw, and it only


538
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,836
affects your debug app.


539
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,486
It does not affect any other


540
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,036
processes that are running, and


541
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,056
it doesn't, importantly, it


542
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,256
doesn't change any system


543
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:55,666
settings.


544
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:56,876
So, it's really great and


545
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:57,766
convenient to use.


546
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,396
It's supported while debugging


547
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,716
in any cases, devices,


548
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,146
simulators, or previews as you


549
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,146
saw, and it's available for all


550
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:05,806
of our platforms.


551
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:07,156
Some of the settings may differ,


552
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:09,126
but it's available for any of


553
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:09,936
the platforms that you can


554
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:10,186
debug.


555

advantage of these new features


557
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,646

a wider range of conditions and


559

turnaround time between editing


576
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:48,936
your source code and updating


577
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:49,376
the preview.


578
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,366
But because some of us, no all


579
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:53,476
of us are mere mortals, we are


580
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,256
bound to introduce code, a bug


581
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:55,726
in the code.


582
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,176
So Xcode allows the debugger to


583
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,406
be attached to the preview


584
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:00,746
instance in order to seek out


585
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:01,286
those bugs.


586
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,006
When the debugger is attached,


587
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,196
you have access to all the great


588
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,186
tools, such as debug navigator


589
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,976
where you can examine the


590
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,636
backtrace.


591
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:12,926
Break points, where you can


592
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:13,826
pause the debugger.


593
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:17,216
Debug bar, where you can search


594
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,426
for your process control button,


595
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:19,436
such as stepping controls.


596
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:21,846
And variables view, where you


597
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:22,876
can inspect the state of the


598
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:23,926
process when paused.


599
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,946
New in Xcode 11 is going to


600
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,336
start showing you Swift UI


601
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:30,276
runtime issues.


602
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,986
Now this is part of a new


603
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,726
category of issues that are


604
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,466
generated by system frameworks,


605
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,306
and typically it's related to


606
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,016
how their APIs are not used


607
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:41,456
correctly.


608
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:46,336
Xcode will find them when the


609
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,066
process is running, and we


610
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:49,916
currently have a couple of


611
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,426
frameworks that are


612
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,326
participating, and because Swift


613
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,976
UI is brand new, it's designed


614
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,426
from the get-go to generate


615
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:56,206
these issues for you.


616
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:58,726
These issues do not crash a


617
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:00,586
process, but instead they point


618
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,016
to important bugs that we want


619
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,716
you to solve before deploying


620
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:04,696
your app to the app store.


621
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:06,556
To grab your attention, they


622
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:08,096
will show up prominently in


623
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:08,446
Xcode.


624
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,276
They will show up as purple


625
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,766
icons in the activity viewer and


626
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,656
with more details in the issues


627
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:15,126
navigator.


628
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:18,846
Besides previews, these issues


629
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,396
are available for all platforms


630
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:21,726
and run destinations.


631
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,146
To learn more, let's get


632
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:26,436
straight to demo.


633
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:26,876
All right.


634
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,426
This is the project that we have


635
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,706
been working on, and the canvas


636
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,936
starts off with showing you the


637
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:32,666
static preview.


638
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,026
And this preview will show


639
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:39,946
temperature on the right-hand


640
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,516
side when data has been fetched.


641
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:43,806
But before that, it you will


642
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:44,416
show the spinner.


643
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:47,306
The presence of the spinner is


644
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,766
controlled by a state value


645
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:49,496
called loading.


646
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:53,556
Loading becomes false when data


647
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,906
has been fetched, and that's


648
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:56,366
when with the spinner


649
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:56,966
disappears.


650
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,506
Pretty simple logic.


651
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,816
So to get the live preview, as


652
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:03,976
Chris mentioned, you click on


653
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:04,506
the play button.


654
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,726
To get the debugger attached,


655
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:08,636
you can control click to bring


656
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,726
up the contextual menu and select


657
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,955
debug preview.


658
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,056
Now, my QA engineer told me that


659
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,205
she has found a bug in which


660
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,336
spinner doesn't disappear.


661
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,986
So keep an eye, keep your eyes


662
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,016
on it while I get the debug


663
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:20,556
session going.


664
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,116
What happens now is that Xcode


665
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:25,786
will recompile this particular


666
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,036
Swift file with debug info and


667
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:29,546
launch the new preview.


668
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,856
You know that the debugger is


669
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:33,906
attached in two ways.


670
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,936
First, you can go to the debug


671
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,366
navigator and look for it, or


672
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:40,616
you can look for the process


673
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:43,176
control buttons in the debug


674
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:43,426
bar.


675
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,586
It looks like we have a debug


676
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:48,336
session going, and in the


677
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,816
canvas, we can see that the


678
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,756
spinner didn't disappear.


679
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:52,496
So she's right.


680
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:54,386
Let's solve this bug.


681
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,276
Under the debugger, we can see


682
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,666
that a new runtime issue is


683
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,676
showing up in the editor.


684
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,666
We can click on the annotation,


685
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,106
and it will show you a message.


686
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,296
Says here modifying state during


687
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:07,906
view update.


688
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,606
This will cause undefined


689
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,156
behavior.


690
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,826
Now that's quite a mouthful, so


691
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,506
let me explain that.


692
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,136
The body property, retains


693
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:19,126
view hierarchy that will be


694
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:19,696
shown later.


695
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:22,116
The framework will ask for the


696
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:23,896
body property whenever it thinks


697
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,006
that the views need to be


698
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:25,416
updated.


699
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,746
So you have no control over when


700
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:29,486
or how many times it's going to


701
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:30,006
be asked.


702
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,416
Thus there's no context, there's


703
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,756
absolutely no context for you to


704
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:35,356
make a decision on how to change


705
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:36,016
the state value.


706
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,296
Luckily for us, its loading can


707
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,916
be changed at a better place,


708
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:42,616
which is at the callback of the


709
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:43,286
weather fetcher.


710
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,266
On line 47.


711
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,126
So, I'm going to move this chunk


712
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:54,696
of code to line 47, but you will


713
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,176
see that Xcode notices source


714
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,606
code added changes and will


715
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,276
automatically try to launch a


716
00:18:59,276 --> 00:18:59,946
new preview.


717
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,556
So, again, keep your eye on the


718
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:02,776
spinner in case I'm doing it too


719
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:02,976
slow.


720
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,246
So here's the spinner.


721
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,356
Data is fetched.


722
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,676
Oh wait, debugger session has to


723
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:18,006
come in.


724
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:19,446
Here's the spinner.


725
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:20,716
It's fetching the data.


726
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:22,836
The data comes in, spinner


727
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:23,446
disappears.


728
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:24,926
So bug is number one solved.


729
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:29,606
[ Applause ]


730
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,676
To stop the debug session, you


731
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:32,796
go back to the same place where


732
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,276
you started it and click on the


733
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:35,296
stop button.


734
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,366
So my ever diligent QA engineer


735
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,616
told me that she also has a


736
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:40,816
different bug for me, and this


737
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:41,906
time it's with a different view.


738
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:44,166
It's called a plain details


739
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:45,896
view.


740
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,586
So let me show it.


741
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,176
And I'll get the debug session


742
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,456
going while I describe the


743
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,086
situation.


744
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,726
So we have a header here at the


745
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,766
top, and the design here is for


746
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,196
it to get slightly bigger, when


747
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,766
I do a pull down on the screen.


748
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,616
This is to help folks like me


749
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:04,096
see better.


750
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,676
So, it looks like we have a


751
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:06,836
debug session, so let me try it


752
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:07,766
out.


753
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,496
So it does get bigger, that's


754
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:10,696
good.


755
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,776
And at some point it suddenly


756
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:13,396
disappears.


757
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:15,176
So this must be the bug she's


758
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:15,856
referring to.


759
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:19,036
And then over here I'd noticed


760
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,786
that a purple icon popped up in


761
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,316
the activity viewer.


762
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,206
So, I'm going to click on that,


763
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:26,256
and that should bring me to the


764
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,886
issues navigator where it says


765
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,356
cannot invert singular matrix.


766
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,736
Hmm. For those of us who


767
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:33,536
breathe CGAL affine transform daily, you know


768
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,966
exactly what this means.


769
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,366
For the rest of us, here's a


770
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,486
two-hour lecture on high school


771
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:40,236
linear algebra.


772
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,106
And there's my math PhD friend


773
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:45,306
pumping his fist, but no, let's


774
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:45,756
not do that.


775
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,186
But here's a very brief


776
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:47,866
explanation.


777
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,236
Getting the inverse of a matrix


778
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:51,486
is akin to doing some math


779
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:51,996
division.


780
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:53,856
Now math division you guys all


781
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:54,106
know.


782
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:55,606
There are some values that are


783
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:56,646
simply not possible.


784
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:00,206
So, we'll see why in a little


785
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,676
bit, but for now let me draw


786
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,186
your attention to another piece


787
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:06,446
of data in the issues navigator,


788
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,786
which is the recorder backtrace


789
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:08,986
generated by the debugger.


790
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,576
You disclose that, you will see


791
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:14,286
backtrace and then there will be


792
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,546
a frame with your debug symbol,


793
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,646
which is frame number one.


794
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,666
You select that, it will


795
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,836
navigate you to the following


796
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,836
line where the issue is


797
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:22,536
generated.


798
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:23,976
But in this case, knowing where


799
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:25,976
is less important than how or


800
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:26,366
when.


801
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,376
And typically to do that, we


802
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:29,506
need to pause in the debugger,


803
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,326
and then you can inspect the


804
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:32,286
state of the process.


805
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,676
Now you guys probably know what


806
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:34,816
tool I'm going to use to hunt


807
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:35,516
down these bugs.


808
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:37,336
Yes, break points.


809
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,706
I can simply put a final break


810
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:44,286
point in line 44, but guess


811
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:44,856
what?


812
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,106
It's going to be hit many times


813
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,246
when I do the pull down, so it's


814
00:21:48,246 --> 00:21:49,306
going to be less effective.


815
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:50,656
So, let's not do that.


816
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,366
Instead, let's head over to the


817
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,866
break points navigator and click


818
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:00,376
on the add button.


819
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:01,586
Where in Xcode 11 we have


820
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,676
introduced a new breakpoint


821
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,326
called runtime issue breakpoint,


822
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,216
let's add that.


823
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:08,646
We'll leave the tab at


824
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:09,536
system frameworks.


825
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:11,916
Now, during the demo I like to


826
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,036
introduce tips and tricks that


827
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:14,526
will make your workflow more


828
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:14,926
productive.


829
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:16,066
Here's another good one.


830
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:18,786
If you ever have a need to stop


831
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:19,976
and restart your preview, you


832
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:21,946
can use the appropriately named


833
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,536
refresh shortcut under the


834
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:25,126
editor menu.


835
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:26,966
Let's try that.


836
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:31,786
So we have a new preview with a


837
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:32,596
debugger attached.


838
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,566
The Xcode will always remember


839
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:35,826
your previous configuration.


840
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,596
So if you use the debugger, the


841
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:39,876
debugger will be attached to the


842
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:40,726
new preview session.


843
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:43,046
So, I'm going to do a pulldown.


844
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:44,006
If I'm lucky, I'll hit the


845
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:44,466
breakpoint.


846
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:45,366
There we go.


847
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,686
And Xcode conveniently brings up


848
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:48,916
the variables view.


849
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:51,086
Now we know there's something


850
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,226
wrong with our skill transform,


851
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,906
so I'm going to twist it open


852
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,206
and look at the matrix.


853
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,996
M11 is the value that we're


854
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,476
using for X scaling.


855
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,396
We're not doing anything with


856
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,236
it, so we're keeping it at a


857
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:03,876
constant one.


858
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,146
M22 is the value that we are


859
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:08,986
using for Y scaling, and when


860
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,526
this value gets to 0, the math


861
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,196
formula for getting the inverse


862
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,656
just doesn't work, right.


863
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:19,786
Yeah. So, now we know why the


864
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:22,196
issue is generated, and let's


865
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,206
get up in the code to see where


866
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,306
I assign the value to be 0, for


867
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,446
the Y scaling to be 0.


868
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:28,496
It looks like it's this line


869
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:28,876
right here.


870
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:29,836
Now fix it.


871
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:31,346
And while I'm here, I'll make


872
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,006
the code more succinct.


873
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:35,716
Oops.


874
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:38,506
All right.


875
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:41,446
I will close the debug area.


876
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:46,106
All right, let me try it now and


877
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:47,716
get-- okay, it gets bigger, and


878
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:48,806
it sticks.


879
00:23:49,406 --> 00:23:51,616
Good. Bug number two solved, and


880
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:52,716
that actually marks the end of


881
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:52,976
my demo.


882
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,500
[ Applause ]


883
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,376
So, when you are debugging live


884
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,706
previews, there are three things


885
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:08,066
that can be different compared


886
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:08,946
to when you are doing regular


887
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:09,456
debugging.


888
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:12,146
First, you use the contextual


889
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,356
manual of the play button in the


890
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:17,046
canvas to start you debug


891
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:17,406
session.


892
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,246
To stop it, you click on the


893
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:19,776
same button.


894
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,136
And you guys saw that Xcode


895
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,536
automatically notices source


896
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,286
code added changes and then


897
00:24:26,286 --> 00:24:28,806
tries to launch a preview, a new


898
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:29,506
preview for you.


899
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,296
This happens with or without the


900
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:31,776
debugger.


901
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,626
But with the debugger, there


902
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:35,266
will be a new debug session.


903
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,336
So, if you want to keep the same


904
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,736
debug session associated with


905
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,656
the same file in the editor, do


906
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:42,046
not change that file.


907
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:43,936
To view a different file, you


908
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:45,306
use a different pane, a


909
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:46,486
different tab, or a different


910
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:46,836
window.


911
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,756
So Sebastian will show the


912
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:49,706
workflow in a little bit.


913
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:55,106
All right.


914
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:56,946
For my demo, we learned that


915
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:58,186
when you are debugging live


916
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,606
previews, you have access to all


917
00:24:59,606 --> 00:25:00,676
the great tools that you are so


918
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,526
used to, but to be more


919
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,376
productive, you want to leverage


920
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,556
on the workflows that we have


921
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,856
designed especially for


922
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:07,496
previews.


923
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,616
And pay attention to those Swift


924
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:12,306
UI runtime issues, because they


925
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:14,776
do point to real bugs and make


926
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,676
use of the runtime issue


927
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:17,936
breakpoint to help you with the


928
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:18,376
debugging.


929
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,436
And I've shown you several ways


930
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,786
to do debugging, but sometimes


931
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:24,056
you just need to do it visually,


932
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,006
and to do that, let's bring out


933
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:26,506
Sebastian.


934
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:31,826
[ Applause ]


935
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:32,976
>> Thank you Han Ming.


936
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,226
We will indeed take a look at


937
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,406
debugging Swift UI View


938
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,816
hierarchies in a demo, but


939
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,246
before we do so, let's take a


940
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:43,036
look at a couple characteristics


941
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:44,626
of Swift UI and key differences


942
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,006
between Swift UI and traditional


943
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,426
UI frameworks like AppKit and


944
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,186
UIKit and see how that may


945
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:50,536
impact your debugging workflows.


946
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,066
First of all, Swift UI makes use


947
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,206
of a declarative API.


948
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,716
That means, instead of


949
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,216
initializing the views that will


950
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,856
be presented at runtime yourself


951
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,246
and your own source code, you


952
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,436
provide a recipe of your view


953
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,866
hierarchy, and the framework


954
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,676
constructs your views and keeps


955
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,546
them up to date for you at


956
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:06,866
runtime.


957
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,866
Swift UI embraces composition


958
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:11,306
and lightweight modifiers over


959
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:13,806
complex view types, so views


960
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:14,926
that you may be inspecting at


961
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,226
runtime have a lot less


962
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:17,496
properties to inspect.


963
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,636
Views in Swift UI are value


964
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:20,946
types.


965
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,616
That means debugging workflows


966
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,276
that rely on references to views


967
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:25,476
may not be applicable anymore,


968
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,236
and at runtimes, Swift UI may


969
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,606
translate certain views that you


970
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:31,446
use in your code and to platform


971
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:33,226
specific UIKit and AppKit views,


972
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:34,956
and we will see an example of


973
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:37,716
that later in the demo.


974
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:39,546
Swift UI also mixes very well


975
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,626
with existing framework views


976
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,306
from your UIKit or AppKit, and


977
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,466
the travel app that you saw


978
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:46,496
earlier actually makes use of


979
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,916
exactly that concept to mix a


980
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,796
UIKit view with the Swift UI


981
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,176
views, which are the main views


982
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,776
used in that application.


983
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,056
With these aspects in mind,


984
00:26:58,196 --> 00:26:59,426
let's switch to the demo machine


985
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:00,596
and take a look at inspecting


986
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,856
the view hierarchy of our


987
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,016
profile screen of the travel


988
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:03,126
app.


989
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:06,186
[applause] Thank you.


990
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,576
And we're debugging the profile


991
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:09,726
view of the travel app again,


992
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,706
and we're already in debug mode


993
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:11,936
here.


994
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:13,366
And let me resize the inspector


995
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,666
a little bit.


996
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:16,906
To inspect the view hierarchy,


997
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,716
we can use this button down here


998
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:20,456
in Xcode's debug bar to debug


999
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:21,266
view hierarchy.


1000
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:22,836
And as Han Ming mentioned


1001
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,126
earlier, we have to ensure that


1002
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,646
the preview stays open while


1003
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:26,766
we're debugging since the debug


1004
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:28,206
session is tied to the lifetime


1005
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:28,796
of the preview.


1006
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:31,066
We can do so using the new


1007
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,696
editor split feature in Xcode 11


1008
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:34,676
by holding down option while we


1009
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:36,436
click the debug view hierarchy


1010
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:37,716
button in Xcode's debug bar.


1011
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,106
That will open up the view debug


1012
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:40,746
canvas in a separate editor


1013
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,236
split, and we have access to the


1014
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,236
source code on the top left, the


1015
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,886
preview on the bottom left, and


1016
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:47,846
the view debug canvas on the


1017
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:48,456
right-hand side.


1018
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,391
[Applause]


1019
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:52,206
Thank you.


1020
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,146
If you've used the view debugger


1021
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,526
before, this is very familiar to


1022
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:56,776
you.


1023
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,756
You have a canvas areas where


1024
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:59,936
you can inspect all your views.


1025
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:01,806
You can export in 3D by simply


1026
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,016
rotating, so you get a good


1027
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,096
overview of your views, and you


1028
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,526
can select elements and see


1029
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:07,476
inspect the properties on the


1030
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:08,076
right-hand side.


1031
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:09,956
The navigator on the left-hand


1032
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:10,816
side has an outline


1033
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,756
representation of your view


1034
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,926
hierarchy so you can orient


1035
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:14,816
yourself relative to subviews


1036
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:15,376
and superviews.


1037
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:18,306
Okay. So, as I mentioned


1038
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,726
earlier, this profile view


1039
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:23,106
combines UIKit and Swift UI, and


1040
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:24,396
looking at the implementation,


1041
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,936
you can see that it returns a


1042
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,466
vertical stack as part of its


1043
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:32,216
body, which includes avatar view


1044
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:33,476
controller view here, and that


1045
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:35,026
view simply loads a UI view


1046
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:36,386
control from a storyboard file,


1047
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:38,656
and below that, it instantiates


1048
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:38,926
a list.


1049
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:41,126
What that means, the top part


1050
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,836
here is built up using UIKit,


1051
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,446
and the bottom part is built up


1052
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,176
using a list with Swift UI.


1053
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,436
The first part of this demo, I


1054
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,166
want to focus on the UI Kit part


1055
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,186
of the view hierarchy, and then


1056
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,466
the second part will focus on


1057
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,146
the Swift UI part.


1058
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,226
New in Xcode 11 is support for


1059
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:58,966
UI Window Scene, which is a


1060
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:01,266
concept used for multiwindow


1061
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:02,756
support and UIKit apps in iOS


1062
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,676
13, and you can see how all UI


1063
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,566
windows are now listed below


1064
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,736
the owning windows scene.


1065
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:10,856
So once you add multiwindow


1066
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:12,396
support in your iOS app, it's


1067
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:13,616
very handy to look out for these


1068
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:14,956
window scenes, and when you


1069
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:16,576
select one in the navigator, you


1070
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:17,766
can also inspect their


1071
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,296
properties, for example, see the


1072
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,006
title and the activation state


1073
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:21,646
in the inspector.


1074
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:25,696
Another new feature in iOS 13 is


1075
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:28,786
dark mode, and there are several


1076
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,766
ways where we enhance the view


1077
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,236
debugger this year to help you


1078
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:33,176
add support in your own


1079
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:33,746
application.


1080
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:36,056
First of all, when you select a


1081
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,536
UI view or UI view controller,


1082
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,086
we now show you trade collection


1083
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:40,286
information in the inspector,


1084
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:41,486
such as the interface style, so


1085
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:43,086
you can ensure that the


1086
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,996
interface style is as expected,


1087
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:46,196
and when you override the


1088
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:47,326
interface style for certain


1089
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,706
subparts of your view hierarchy,


1090
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:50,886
you can debug it right from the


1091
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:51,276
view debugger.


1092
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:54,436
Another key feature of dark mode


1093
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:56,376
are dynamic colors that adapt to


1094
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:57,936
appearance changes, and a good


1095
00:29:57,936 --> 00:29:59,356
way to do that is using


1096
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:00,486
asset catalog and name


1097
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:00,886
colors.


1098
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:02,686
And when we select this badge


1099
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,016
here, you can see that it's


1100
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:06,426
achieving its orange tint with a


1101
00:30:06,426 --> 00:30:08,246
named color, the accent color,


1102
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,316
which is coming from an accent


1103
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:10,686
catalog, so it's now very easy


1104
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,866
to tell whether a color is a


1105
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,056
name color coming from an accent


1106
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,336
catalog that can dynamically


1107
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:16,756
adapt to appearance changes or


1108
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:17,956
whether it's a hard-coded color


1109
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:19,276
that cannot adapt to appearance


1110
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:19,556
changes.


1111
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:21,816
Another new feature are symbol


1112
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:24,276
images, and this badge actually


1113
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:25,666
makes use of a symbol image.


1114
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:27,316
When I just go up a little bit


1115
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:28,776
in this inspector, you can see


1116
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,156
details about the symbol image


1117
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:30,816
in the inspector.


1118
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:32,866
We now show names for all images


1119
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,186
that you select in the


1120
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:35,826
inspector, and you can get


1121
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,806
details like symbol


1122
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:37,996
configuration and see that it's


1123
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,576
in fact a system symbol image


1124
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,106
compared to for example a custom


1125
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,306
symbol that you created in your


1126
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:42,756
assent catalog.


1127
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:47,026
[ Applause ]


1128
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:48,976
Symbol images are aware of their


1129
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:50,256
baseline, so they lay out very


1130
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,616
nicely next to text.


1131
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:54,976
We visualize the baseline in


1132
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,266
this view on the right-hand


1133
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,196
side, and to make sure it


1134
00:30:58,196 --> 00:30:59,906
actually lays out nicely next to


1135
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:02,046
text, we have to, in the UIKit


1136
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,576
world where we use auto layout


1137
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:04,746
constraints and ensure that we


1138
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:06,256
use the baseline constraints


1139
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,106
instead of, for example,


1140
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:07,706
centering them.


1141
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:09,596
Because if this name gets longer


1142
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:11,586
and causes a line break, and we


1143
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,806
have a multiline label, we want


1144
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,036
to ensure the badge is aligned


1145
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,216
to the first line of this label.


1146
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,556
We can very easily verify this


1147
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,666
with the badge selected.


1148
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:19,726
We can switch to the size


1149
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:21,506
inspector and take a look at the


1150
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:22,736
constraint details.


1151
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,386
We overhauled this section in


1152
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:26,306
Xcode 11 to be a lot more like


1153
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,506
interface builder and be more


1154
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,506
powerful, so you can now


1155
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:29,616
highlight constraints as you


1156
00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:30,326
mouse over them.


1157
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,146
You can use this mini navigator


1158
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,996
here to filter down to a


1159
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:35,846
specific edge, and we can easily


1160
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:38,186
confirm that this badge is in


1161
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:39,406
fact using the first baseline


1162
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:40,686
constraint to the label that's


1163
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:41,176
next to it.


1164
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:43,016
So, that's exactly what we want,


1165
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:46,396
and we were easily able to


1166
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:46,976
confirm this.


1167
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,226
Okay. So, these are the


1168
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:50,096
enhancements we made on the


1169
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:50,686
UIKit side.


1170
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,716
Let's switch our focus to


1171
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:53,256
SwiftUI.


1172
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,736
As we saw, we're currently


1173
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:58,386
looking at the preview of the


1174
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:00,976
profile view, and looking at the


1175
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:02,386
navigator on the left-hand side,


1176
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,516
you can see the profile view


1177
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:05,146
shows up there, and we can get a


1178
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,546
good understanding of its size


1179
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:07,496
in the canvas area.


1180
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:09,966
We saw that it's using a


1181
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,066
vertical stack, and we can also


1182
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,646
see that in the canvas area, and


1183
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:14,056
selecting it, you can get


1184
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:14,976
details about it and then


1185
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:15,796
inspect on the right.


1186
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:17,716
Switching back to the profile


1187
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:19,396
view, which has a few more


1188
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,386
properties, you can see that a


1189
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:23,576
lot of properties about this


1190
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:24,936
view show up in inspector, and


1191
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,186
we actually use Swift reflection


1192
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,696
to automatically discover these


1193
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,226
properties.


1194
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:30,276
So, even for your own custom


1195
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,946
views, we automatically now show


1196
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:33,126
these properties in inspector,


1197
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,056
which is a lot more powerful


1198
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,616
than before where we only


1199
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,156
supported system views.


1200
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:39,796
And we even went one step


1201
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,076
further.


1202
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:41,076
You can now customize the


1203
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,226
properties that show up in


1204
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,406
inspector on the right-hand side


1205
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,066
by implementing the customer


1206
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,646
reflectable protocol on your


1207
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:48,446
view types, and profile view is


1208
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,396
exactly doing that.


1209
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:51,196
You can see that it's returning


1210
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:53,086
three different properties here,


1211
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,976
account status, last login, and


1212
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,436
profile, as part of a custom


1213
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,686
mirror, and looking at the


1214
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,316
inspect on the right, you can


1215
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,656
see that these are exactly the


1216
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:02,726
properties that I'll return.


1217
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:04,916
So that's a very powerful


1218
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,706
feature to let you return


1219
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:07,926
exactly the data that you need


1220
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:08,636
while you're debugging.


1221
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:13,716
[ Applause ]


1222
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,056
Taking another look at the


1223
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:16,006
inspector, you can see that at


1224
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:18,136
the top we get properties of


1225
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:20,486
view that is selected currently,


1226
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:21,946
the profile view, and then


1227
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:23,256
further down, we can see all the


1228
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,556
modifiers that are currently in


1229
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:25,846
effect on that selected view.


1230
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:27,136
So we can see details about the


1231
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:28,436
padding and the safe area


1232
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:29,036
inset, for example.


1233
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,966
Let's take another look at a


1234
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:34,936
different part of the view


1235
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,106
hierarchy, and as we saw


1236
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,636
earlier, the bottom part is


1237
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:40,246
using a list to lay out all the


1238
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:40,576
views.


1239
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:42,566
So let's select one of the views


1240
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:43,686
that we see here, for example,


1241
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:47,006
the 965 text here, and I will


1242
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:48,596
use gesture of navigate and


1243
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,196
reveal in debug navigator so we


1244
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,236
have a good understanding of


1245
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:52,816
where it is inside the view


1246
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:53,256
hierarchy.


1247
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:55,016
And we can see that Swift UI


1248
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,936
actually translated that list


1249
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,446
into a UI table view under the


1250
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:00,856
hood, and it's using table view


1251
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,606
cells to host the Swift UI views


1252
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:05,066
that we construct in our code.


1253
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:06,816
This is an implementation


1254
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:08,255
detail, and you should not rely


1255
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,356
on it in your implementation,


1256
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:10,976
but it can be very helpful when


1257
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:12,626
you're trying to debug layout


1258
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:13,795
issues, for example.


1259
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,576
With this text selected, there's


1260
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,005
actually an issue here that our


1261
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:18,946
designer pointed out.


1262
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,206
Instead of vertically centering


1263
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:24,416
these two texts, they should


1264
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,636
actually be baseline aligned.


1265
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,826
Now, we already saw that there's


1266
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:29,835
a horizontal stack that is


1267
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,426
laying them out next to each


1268
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:33,446
other, and when we take a look


1269
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,136
at the implementation, here, you


1270
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,016
can see that it's a plain


1271
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,505
horizontal stack that has no


1272
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:39,556
parameters passed to its


1273
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,085
initializer.


1274
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:41,536
But when we take a look at the


1275
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,966
inspector, you can see that it


1276
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:45,005
actually defaults to an


1277
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:45,906
alignment of center.


1278
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:47,186
Now, we don't want center


1279
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,295
alignment, we want the baseline


1280
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:48,706
alignment.


1281
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,786
So, let's adjust the code and


1282
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:52,576
fix this problem.


1283
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,286
I will close the view debugger,


1284
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,976
continue the debug session, and


1285
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:58,586
activate the previews again.


1286
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,886
And for the H stack, I will now


1287
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,516
add a parameter of alignment to


1288
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,326
dot first baseline, and we can


1289
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:08,976
now see that the two labels are


1290
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:11,146
in fact baseline aligned.


1291
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:11,886
So we were--


1292
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:15,856
[ Applause ]


1293
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:19,206
We were able to see the default


1294
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:20,546
value that the H stack assumed


1295
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,096
for its alignment, figure out


1296
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:24,476
the fix for it, and then


1297
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,086
instantly verify it using the


1298
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,506
new previews in Xcode 11.


1299
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:29,516
With that, I will switch back to


1300
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:29,966
slides.


1301
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:32,616
We just saw, when you're


1302
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:33,616
inspecting Swift UI view


1303
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:36,326
hierarchies, the view hierarchy


1304
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,036
shows up in the navigator on the


1305
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,456
left-hand side and in the canvas


1306
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,426
area, and properties and


1307
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:43,026
modifiers are presented in


1308
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:44,176
inspect on the right-hand side.


1309
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,396
Inspect the properties are


1310
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,636
automatically discovered using


1311
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,806
Swift Reflection, and you can


1312
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:50,106
even customize the inspector


1313
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,806
properties that show up in


1314
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:52,816
inspector on the right-hand side


1315
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:54,136
using the custom reflectable


1316
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:54,606
protocol.


1317
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,976
And, of course, just as Swift


1318
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,306
UI, we also have support for


1319
00:35:58,306 --> 00:35:59,626
mixed view hierarchies, and we


1320
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:01,456
just saw how the UIKit view


1321
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:02,396
showed up right next to the


1322
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:03,006
Swift UI views.


1323
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,656
We also have numerous


1324
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:07,616
enhancements for UIKit views,


1325
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:10,646
namely support for UI Window


1326
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,926
Scene, which will be handy as


1327
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:13,916
you start adopting multiple


1328
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,006
windows in your UIKit


1329
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,476
applications, and we have


1330
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,616
inspector enhancement to provide


1331
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,396
even more details such as trait


1332
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:21,326
collection details.


1333
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:24,326
We saw the named images and


1334
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,626
symbol image information.


1335
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,316
We also saw named colors, which


1336
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,436
will be very helpful as you


1337
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,436
start it up in dark mode.


1338
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,686
And we have greatly improved


1339
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:33,736
constraint details in the


1340
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:34,886
inspector, which are more


1341
00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:36,366
powerful than ever before when


1342
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:37,486
you're debugging your auto


1343
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,386
layout constraints in your UIKit


1344
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:39,906
application.


1345
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:42,586
If you want to learn more about


1346
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:45,126
device conditions, I recommend


1347
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,466
this session here, and there's


1348
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,346
also a great video that's


1349
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,036
teaching about LLDB and


1350
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:52,646
enhancements.


1351
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:56,326
With that, that brings us to the


1352
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:56,886
end of this talk.


1353
00:36:57,636 --> 00:36:59,116
I wish you a fantastic rest of


1354
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,546
the conference, and I'll see you


1355
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:00,976
at the bash.
