00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:25,436
>> Good afternoon.


4
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,166
Hi. My name is Matthew
Ricketson.


5
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:34,106
I'm a software engineer working
on UIKit, and today we're going


6
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:38,396
to talk about Focus
Interaction on tvOS.


7
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,696
Last year we introduced
tvOS, a great new platform


8
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:44,556
for building apps on Apple TV.


9
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,796
And whether you're building
a brand new app for Apple TV


10
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:52,636
or looking to port an existing
app over from another platform,


11
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:54,276
it's immediately obvious


12
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,926
that Apple TV is unlike
other Apple devices.


13
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:02,256
There's no touchscreen on a TV
or a mouse because these forms


14
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,215
of user input just
don't make sense


15
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,546
in a living room environment.


16
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:10,866
Instead, we use this, a
remote, like the Siri Remote,


17
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,926
in order to control
Apple TV from a distance.


18
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:18,386
The Siri Remote and Apple TV
have been designed together


19
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:21,046
to provide the best
navigation experience.


20
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:26,046
But Apple TV also supports
many other input devices,


21
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:29,096
like game controllers,
Bluetooth keyboards,


22
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,486
and the new remote app.


23
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:35,276
And sometimes users might feel
more comfortable using one


24
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:39,316
of these other input devices in
order to control their Apple TV,


25
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,396
and tvOS helps you
support all of these


26
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:46,046
through a user interaction
model that we call Focus.


27
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:51,636
With Focus interaction, users
indirectly control the UI


28
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,616
through a single focused
user interface element


29
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,296
and they can move focus


30
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,946
around the screen
using any input device.


31
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:05,006
Users will expect that your
apps are optimized toward great


32
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:06,016
with Focus interaction.


33
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,566
And to help with that, UIKit
provides built-in focus behavior


34
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:14,446
for all of its standard
controls; however,


35
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,576
you may also want to customize
the focus behavior in your apps


36
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:19,086
in order to take them
to the next level


37
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,466
and provide an even
better user experience.


38
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,896
And for that, UIKit
exposes a Focus API.


39
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:30,016
Now today's talk is
about that Focus API


40
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,936
and we split it into two parts.


41
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,596
First, we're going to
dive into what's new


42
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,656
in the Focus API
this year in tvOS 10.


43
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,926
And then in the second part
of the talk, we're going to go


44
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,736
into an extended case study
on how to build a custom,


45
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,716
fully focusable control
completely from scratch.


46
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,066
This is a great demo
that will show you how


47
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,876
to get started building
unique interaction experiences


48
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,516
in your tvOS apps.


49
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,906
Now a quick note
before we get started.


50
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,576
We're going to assume that you
have at least some familiarity


51
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,836
with the Focus API
and the basic concepts


52
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,126
of how Focus works on tvOS.


53
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,416
But even if you're new to
the platform, don't worry.


54
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,416
You can still generally
follow along, and at the end


55
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,736
of the talk today, we'll call
out some useful resources


56
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:18,286
to help you get started with
building apps for Apple TV.


57
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:25,256
So what's new in tvOS 10 and to
start, we've added some new APIs


58
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,556
to enhance the preferred
focus system.


59
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:33,056
Now as a quick review, when
we talk about preferred focus,


60
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,236
we mean the process
of determining


61
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:38,966
where Focus should show
up after a Focus update.


62
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,256
Whenever Focus updates,


63
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:44,746
for example when your app first
launches, the Focus engine needs


64
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,646
to know where focus
should be directed to.


65
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,906
It does this by asking your app


66
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,036
where it prefers
Focus gets directed.


67
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,696
Let's look at a specific
example.


68
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,216
When your app first launches,
the Focus engine is going to try


69
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,466
to figure out where Focus
should show up by default,


70
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:05,156
and it's going to start by
looking at the focus environment


71
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,816
that we're updating Focus to.


72
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:08,826
And when our app first
launches, that's the window.


73
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:12,936
In this case, the Focus engine
will ask the window what's its


74
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,416
preferred Focus view is.


75
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,055
The window delegates
this responsibility


76
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,326
to its root view controller,


77
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:22,416
which could also return some
other view in the hierarchy


78
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,086
as its preferred Focus view.


79
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,196
The Focus engine will then ask


80
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,296
that view what its
preferred Focus view is


81
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,286
and it will continue
following down this chain


82
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,296
until it reaches the end, which
is the last focusable view


83
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,776
that it found as the new
Focus view on screen.


84
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,716
Leveraging the Preferred
Focus System is important


85
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,756
to provide a good
user experience


86
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,636
in complex apps, especially.


87
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:48,176
So that focus is directed to
the correct parts of the screen


88
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,646
at the appropriate times.


89
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:54,456
In tvOS 10, we're
providing a new property


90
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:58,376
that allows your apps to
easily express complex Focus


91
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:01,536
preferences and the name of this
property is appropriately called


92
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,336
Preferred Focus Environments
declared


93
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,806
in the UIFocusEnvironment
protocol and it returns an array


94
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,976
of objects that also conform to
the UIFocusEnvironment protocol.


95
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:13,876
And this property has
two primary benefits.


96
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:19,246
First, by returning objects that
conform to UIFocusEnvironment,


97
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:23,726
you can specify that focus be
directed to any environment


98
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,556
on screen, not just views but
also view controllers directly.


99
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,756
The second benefit
of this property is


100
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,486
that it returns an array of
these focus environments,


101
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,696
which allows you to specify
an ordered list of preferences


102
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,266
and this enables complex,
multipart-preferences


103
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,206
to be expressed much
more concisely.


104
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:46,286
And there's a specific pattern
where we can see this happening


105
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:49,146
that Preferred Focus
is commonly used


106
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,556
in which is custom
container view controllers.


107
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:55,586
Let's look at an
example of that.


108
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,776
Say we have an app with a
structure that looks like this.


109
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,156
We have a container
view controller


110
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,466
with two child view controllers.


111
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,966
In this example, we want
our container to prefer


112
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,976
that focus show up in the left
child view controller first,


113
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,396
but if that's not possible,
focus should be directed


114
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,946
to its right child
view controller.


115
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:19,276
And we can express this logic
very concisely using the new


116
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,236
preferredFocusEnvironments
property.


117
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:25,726
Here, we override
preferredFocusEnvironments


118
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,026
to return an array of both
children with the left child


119
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,676
as the first item in the array.


120
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,816
This is great because
we don't have


121
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,396
to check ourselves whether
the left child view controller


122
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,986
actually contains
anything focusable.


123
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,186
We don't have to know anything


124
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,116
about the contents
of that controller.


125
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,126
We just tell the Focus engine
what our preferences are


126
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,566
and it takes care of
the hard work for us.


127
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,246
So if our left child
view controller


128
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,356
in this example happened to
not contain anything focusable,


129
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,506
the Focus engine will
automatically fall back


130
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,706
to that right child
view controller instead.


131
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,786
And in this example, maybe it
does find something focusable.


132
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:03,546
So the
preferredFocusEnvironments


133
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,376
property helps us to express
these preferences much more


134
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,456
clearly and concisely,


135
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,006
and if the first item doesn't
produce anything focusable,


136
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:16,146
we can easily fall back to the
other environments in the list.


137
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,686
Next up, we have
another enhancement


138
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,836
to the Preferred Focus
System and this is


139
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:23,496
for more specific use case
involving restoring Focus


140
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,376
after view controller
transitions.


141
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:30,186
So before we introduce the API,
let's first look at an example


142
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:33,546
to illustrate what exactly
we mean by focus restoration.


143
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:38,326
Say we have an app
that looks like this.


144
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,526
It's a simple view controller
with a menu of buttons.


145
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,126
And our root view
controller has preferred


146
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,886
that by default we want our
first button to become focused.


147
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,156
It did this using the
preferredFocusEnvironments


148
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,516
property that we just looked at.


149
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,886
Now suppose the user moves to
the last button in the list


150
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:56,386
and selects that button


151
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,586
to present a detail
view controller.


152
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,516
In that case we're
interested in is


153
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,806
when this detail view
controller gets dismissed.


154
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:09,746
After the dismissal, focus
needs to be restored back


155
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,596
to our root view controller.


156
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,306
Now the user would
probably expect


157
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,126
that focus gets restored
back to the button


158
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:20,326
that was last focused,
before our presentation,


159
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,636
which is the last
button in our list.


160
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,276
However, if we ask our
root view controller


161
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:29,136
at this time what its preferred
focus environments are,


162
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,836
it would still direct us to
that first default button.


163
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:36,316
And so instead, the Focus engine
automatically remembers the last


164
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,645
focus item for us so that after
the transition is complete,


165
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,556
it automatically restores
focus to that last button


166
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,406
that the user would expect.


167
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,996
This is behavior that
existed in tvOS 9.


168
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,236
While this is almost always
the behavior that both the user


169
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:57,496
and often the developer
expects, there are some cases


170
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,796
where you might want to
restore focus to some other part


171
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,886
of your user interface.


172
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,096
Suppose for example that while
our detail view is presented,


173
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,466
our app's underlying
data model changed


174
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,096
so that the last button
now represents a completely


175
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,486
different action or data
item that it did previously.


176
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,446
In that case the user might not
expect focus be automatically


177
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:18,166
restored back to that last item.


178
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,646
In that case, we
want the Focus engine


179
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:25,326
to use your view controller's
preferred focus environments


180
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,516
in order to determine where
focus should be restored to.


181
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,576
And in tvOS 10, we're
providing an API


182
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,566
that allows you to do just that.


183
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,636
It's called
restoresFocusAfterTransition.


184
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,706
It's a Boolean property
defined on UIViewController


185
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:42,936
and the way it works
is very simple.


186
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,126
If set to true, the view
controller will use the


187
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:47,916
default behavior.


188
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,496
It'll tell the Focus engine


189
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:53,326
to use its default behavior
restoring focus to the last item


190
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,266
that was focused before
the transition occurred.


191
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,056
If set to false, however,


192
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,736
then the Focus engine will
instead consult your view


193
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,776
controller's
preferredFocusEnvironments


194
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,476
giving your app a
chance to control


195
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,976
where focus gets
directed to on screen.


196
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:11,966
The property is set to
true by default to maintain


197
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,626
that previous default behavior


198
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,806
and it affects view
controller presentation,


199
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:17,756
like we just talked about,


200
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:22,046
but other common built-in view
controller transitions as well


201
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,676
such as navigation pops and
moving focus back and forth


202
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,536
between your view
controller and the tab bar.


203
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,956
We recommend that when
using this property,


204
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:36,546
set it always be true or always
be false so that focus updates


205
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:37,616
within your view controllers


206
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:41,396
in a consistent and
predictable way.


207
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,836
We really hope that this
property will help you solve


208
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:46,606
some of those tricky edge cases
that you found in your app.


209
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:50,936
To show you how to use
both of these properties


210
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,876
that we just talked
about, I'd like to invite


211
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,626
up my colleague Brandon
for a quick demo.

[ Applause ]


213
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,176
>> Hi, everyone.


214
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,446
My name is Brandon and I'm
here today to show you how


215
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,596
to take advantage of some


216
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:14,006
of the new Focus APIs
available in tvOS 10.


217
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,386
So I've been working on
a simple calendar app


218
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,116
and it's coming along
pretty well so far.


219
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:23,456
You can view your events for a
given week and you can switch


220
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,546
between weeks using the
next and previous buttons.


221
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,976
Now when the app
launches, we initially focus


222
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,036
on the previous button


223
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,286
when I think it would
actually be a better experience


224
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,186
if we focused on the
user's next event.


225
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,356
So let's go modify
our app to do that.


226
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,756
So to direct focus, we need


227
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:43,636
to override the
preferredFocusEnvironments


228
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,086
property.


229
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,826
This returns an array
of UIFocusEnvironment


230
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,576
for the focus engine
to search to search.


231
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,816
We'll start by adding our
upcoming events for the rest


232
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:53,836
of the week to our array.


233
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,246
If we have no more upcoming
events, then we want focus


234
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,686
to default to the next button.


235
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,546
So we'll add that to
our array as well.


236
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,966
Now let's run this,
see if it works.


237
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,116
All right, so this time when
the app launched, we're focused


238
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,446
on the super secret party I'm
hosting after this session.


239
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,846
Now, I wonder what would happen
if I canceled this party.


240
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:21,826
When an event is canceled,


241
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,136
it becomes grayed
out and unfocusable.


242
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,776
So I would expect focus would
just go to our next event,


243
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,566
which is a tvOS lab
tomorrow morning.


244
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:31,846
But a good developer
always tests their code.


245
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:32,936
So let's go try this out.


246
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:36,546
So I'm going to go
to my AppDelegate


247
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:40,976
and cancel my not-so-secret
party and rerun this app.


248
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:51,006
All right, just as we
expected, when the app launched,


249
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,376
we're focused on the tvOS lab.


250
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,406
So because our first
preferred focus environment was


251
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,986
unfocusable, the Focus
engine just moved


252
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,486
to our next preferred
focus environment.


253
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,536
We didn't have to modify
any of our code to do that.


254
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,666
The Focus engine
handled it for us.


255
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,876
Now if you want to view
the details for an event,


256
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:09,896
you can select it to
bring up the Details page.


257
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,336
From here, you can swipe
left to right to go


258
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:13,766
to the next or previous event.


259
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:17,406
I received some bug
reports from beta testers


260
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,766
that when they exit this view,
the focus isn't on the event


261
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,066
that was just selected.


262
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,316
So in this case, we've
selected the bash.


263
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,196
So if I menu out, I would expect


264
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:29,386
that we would be
focused on the bash.


265
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,106
Instead, we're still
focused on the tvOS lab,


266
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:34,886
which is our first available
preferred focus environment.


267
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,026
So all we need to do is update
our preferredFocusEnvironments


268
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,916
code to return our
selected event


269
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,606
as our preferred
focus environment.


270
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,646
So let's go back to our
CalendarViewController,


271
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:49,226
and I have the selectedEventView
property here which keeps track


272
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,466
of the selected event when
we're in the Details page.


273
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,976
So if this property
exists, I'll return it


274
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,846
as my first preferred
focus environment.


275
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,546
All right, let's run
this, see if it works.


276
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,266
Okay. So I'll select the
tvOS lab, move the selection


277
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,266
to the bash, and then menu out,


278
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,146
and we're still focused
on the tvOS lab.


279
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:17,186
And I'm remembering now
that Matt mentioned earlier


280
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:18,906
in the session that by default,


281
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,626
the Focus engine
does not consult your


282
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,106
preferredFocusEnvironments
when restoring


283
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,956
from a view controller.


284
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,746
So to change that behavior,


285
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,696
we need to set the
restoresFocusAfterTransition


286
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,786
property to false.


287
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,836
So let's go do that in our
[inaudible] coder method


288
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,946
and rerun the app,
see if it works now.


289
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,436
All right, we'll select
our tvOS lab event again,


290
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,356
move our selection to
the bash, and menu out.


291
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,076
Awesome, so now we're
focused on the bash,


292
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,486
which is exactly what we wanted.


293
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,756
So by using the
preferredFocusEnvironments


294
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,246
and restoresFocusAfterTransition
properties,


295
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,196
we're able to provide a much
better experience to our users.


296
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:03,976
Now I'd like to invite
Matt back up on stage.

[ Applause ]


298
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:10,796
>> Thanks, Brandon.


299
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,556
That was a really great demo.


300
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,916
Using these two new properties,


301
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,616
we hope that you can reduce the
complexity of code in your apps


302
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,226
and also provide a
better user experience.


303
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:26,476
Now, next up I'm really
excited to announce


304
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,096
that we're bringing focus
interaction support directly


305
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,026
into SpriteKit.


306
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:35,996
Prior to tvOS 10,
SpriteKit developers had


307
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,316
to manually implement
focus interaction


308
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,646
in their SpriteKit games
by manually keeping track


309
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:45,656
of their own state and
handling user events directly.


310
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:50,736
But now in tvOS 10, we're
extending the Focus API,


311
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,686
the same API you're
used to in UIKit,


312
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,226
to also support your
SpriteKit games.


313
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:04,746
But first, what would
this be useful for?


314
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,366
Well the first and most obvious
use case for focus interaction


315
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,996
in games is game menus.


316
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:16,126
Your users will expect
that menus in games feel


317
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:19,866
and behave similar to
menus in other system apps.


318
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:25,106
The Focus Interaction model also
makes sense for board games,


319
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,206
where users navigate around
a two-dimensional game board


320
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,816
and select items on that game
board, maybe move those around.


321
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,146
And in fact, Focus Interaction
makes sense for any type of game


322
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:38,876
where selection is a
core gameplay mechanic.


323
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,126
And in any of this use cases,


324
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:44,096
again users will expect
navigation and selection


325
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,686
to feel similar to the
system focus behavior.


326
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:51,226
Otherwise, your app might feel
weird or broken, unintuitive.


327
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:57,706
And so to help with that, we've
extended the same Focus API


328
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:02,196
that you're used to in UIKit to
now also work with SpriteKit.


329
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:05,096
This is a shared API,
and what this means is


330
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:09,756
that SKNodes are now able to
opt in to becoming focusable


331
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,195
and taking advantage of all


332
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,546
of the Focus engine's
built-in capabilities.


333
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:19,346
UIKit and SpriteKit have been
integrated to allow focus


334
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,915
to move freely between
your views and your nodes


335
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:24,165
so you don't have to handle
those use cases yourself.


336
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:30,896
So how exactly does this work?


337
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:34,766
First, let's review how
Focus works for UIViews.


338
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:39,196
Prior to tvOS 10, UIViews were
the only user interface elements


339
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,016
that were capable
of becoming focused,


340
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,796
and they defined their
focus ability using the


341
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,746
canBecomeFocused property.


342
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:52,716
UIViews also conform to the
UIFocusEnvironment protocol.


343
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,576
And this allows views to get
focus update notifications


344
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,766
and also control the
behavior of focus


345
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,206
within their subview hierarchy.


346
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,986
So to support SpriteKit
focus, we're going to want


347
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,856
to bring these same
capabilities to SKNodes


348
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,106
and we've made some
changes to support that.


349
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:12,626
We're abstracting
these same capabilities


350
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,686
out into their own protocol
that we call UIFocusItem.


351
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:20,786
This protocol defines both
that canBecomeFocused property


352
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,566
and conformance to the
UIFocusEnvironment protocol.


353
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:30,876
Next, we refactored
UIView and extended SKNode


354
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,886
to conform to this new protocol.


355
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,906
And this allows both
UIView and SKNode


356
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:40,696
to share these exact same API
while not requiring any changes


357
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,046
in your existing UIKit code.


358
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,846
We've also made additions to
other parts of the Focus API


359
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,556
in order to take advantage of
this new UIFocusItem protocol.


360
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:54,856
First, let's look at the
UIFocusUpdateContext class,


361
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:58,066
which provides contextual
information during focus


362
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,496
update notifications.


363
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,546
In order to support focus
updates to SpriteKit nodes,


364
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,816
we're introducing two new
UIFocusItem based properties:


365
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:10,186
previouslyFocusedItem
and nextFocusedItem,


366
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:14,016
and these tell you which items
are involved in the update.


367
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,526
We've made a similar
change to UIScreen,


368
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:21,196
introducing a new focusedItem
property that returns an object


369
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,916
to type UIFocusItem and
this allows your app


370
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:29,596
to query what the current focus
item is at any given time.


371
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,476
Now there's one more API
change worth mentioning


372
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,156
but it requires a little
bit more background.


373
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:39,346
In tvOS 9, the UIFocusItem
protocol defined the


374
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,126
preferredFocusView property.


375
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:46,076
And prior to tvOS 10, this was
how apps defined their focus


376
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,386
preferences, like we were
talking about earlier.


377
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,656
But you can probably
see a problem with this,


378
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,246
which is that it
returns a type of UIView.


379
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,216
And if we're going to support
SpriteKit, we're going to need


380
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,576
to define focus preferences
to our SKNodes.


381
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,976
And so this isn't going to work.


382
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:07,336
But luckily, earlier
in the talk,


383
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,006
we introduced this new
preferredFocusEnvironments


384
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,196
property, which does
the same thing.


385
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:15,656
But because it returns an array
of UIFocusEnvironment objects


386
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:19,316
and now SKNode conforms to the
UIFocusEnvironment protocol,


387
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,836
we can now define focus
preferences to views,


388
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,566
view controller, SKNodes,
any object that conforms


389
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,706
to UIFocusEnvironment.


390
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,506
And this makes defining
focus preferences


391
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:33,026
in your environments
much easier and concise.


392
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,776
And because
preferredFocusEnvironments takes


393
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,166
care of all the use cases
for preferredFocusView does


394
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,856
but also provides
these other benefits


395
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:43,446
that we've talked about,
in tvOS 10 we're going


396
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,956
to deprecate preferredFocusView.


397
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:49,036
So if you're currently
using preferredFocusView


398
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:52,106
in your applications,
we recommend upgrading


399
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,246
to preferredFocusEnvironments
instead.


400
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,066
We think this will really help.


401
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,336
So that's Focus Interaction
support in SpriteKit.


402
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,546
Focus API now supports generic
focus items using this new


403
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,036
UIFocusItem protocol.


404
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,626
Both UIView and SKNode
conform to this protocol.


405
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,736
And for SpriteKit
developers, you can now opt


406
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,906
in to supporting focus
to take advantage


407
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:18,316
of all the Focus
engine's capabilities.


408
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,376
For UIKit developers that don't
use SpriteKit in their apps,


409
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,336
there are no changes required.


410
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,876
The view-based API
with the one exception


411
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:30,766
of preferredFocusView is still
available for your convenience.


412
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,556
We do encourage you, however,
to start using this new API


413
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:37,946
in your code to take advantage


414
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,276
of more generic and
future features.


415
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:46,906
For more details on exactly
what you need to do in order opt


416
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,826
in to focus support in
your SpriteKit games,


417
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,006
we recommend watching
the What's New


418
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,426
in SpriteKit session happening
this week, where they go


419
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:56,556
into more detail on exactly
what you need to do to opt in.


420
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:01,086
So that's Focus Interaction
support for SpriteKit.


421
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:06,546
And that concludes our overview
of what's new in tvOS 10.


422
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:10,136
And so for the next part of our
talk, we're going to go in-depth


423
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,486
with a case study on how


424
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,926
to build a fully custom,
focusable control.


425
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,306
And for our example today,


426
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:19,106
we're going to use a
five-star rating control.


427
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,856
Now we've already done some work
and we've built a first draft


428
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:27,076
of this control and I'd
like to show that to you.


429
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:31,206
We just used the normal UIButton
class and presented the rating


430
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,666
as the title of the button.


431
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,536
If you select the button,
it'll bump up the rating,


432
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,776
and if you keep selecting
the button,


433
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,656
it'll cycle through all
the available ratings.


434
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,206
Now this is okay.


435
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,636
It gives us the functionality
that we need, but we really want


436
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:47,896
to take our app to
the next level.


437
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,126
And this control, it's
good but it's not very fun.


438
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,786
It's not very interactive.


439
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,096
And so we thought long and
hard about this and we came


440
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,846
up with a new design and
this is what that looks like.


441
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,246
That's a lot better.


442
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,656
Instead of just saying
one-star or two-star,


443
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,836
we now visually indicate our
rating using actual stars.


444
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,976
When you select the control,
you go into an editing mode,


445
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,666
where you can use
the Focus system


446
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:15,696
to change our rating
between the stars.


447
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,766
And when we're done, we
just press Select again


448
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,706
and we exit editing mode.


449
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:22,996
This is a great example of
a control that is optimized


450
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:25,066
for focus interaction and
we're going to walk you


451
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,016
through building this
control completely


452
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:28,706
from scratch using
the Focus API.


453
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,486
And for that, I'm going to hand
things back over to Brandon.


454
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,500
[ Applause ]


455
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,556
All right, thanks, Matt.


456
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,646
So I have a project here


457
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,436
which contains our simple button
control, but it doesn't look


458
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,326
as nice as the one
Matt just showed us.


459
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,396
So let's just delete that.


460
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,156
Let's go ahead and
drag in a view


461
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,896
to represent our new control.


462
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,216
We'll set up some constraints
on it quickly, so 100 points


463
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:07,956
from the top, a width
of 650, a height of 150,


464
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:14,246
and we'll center it
horizontally in our container.


465
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:17,726
Great. Now I've already
created a rating control class


466
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,046
to represent this
control, so let's assign


467
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,136
that as a views class.


468
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:25,926
And let's go check out
this rating control class.


469
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,816
We chose a subclass
from UIControl


470
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:32,306
because it provides a lot of
functionality to us for free.


471
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,836
For example, it determines if
the control can become focused


472
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:39,206
or not based on its
enabled state; however,


473
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,686
it doesn't have a
focus/unfocused appearance.


474
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:42,986
We have to provide
that ourselves.


475
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,846
So let's go do that.


476
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,696
We'll start by adding a corner
radius and a background color


477
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,836
and then we'll override
didUpdateFocus in context


478
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,996
with coordinator to
provide both a focus


479
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:55,986
and unfocused appearance.


480
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:59,476
So if the next focus
item is our control,


481
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,426
then we'll configure the focus
appearance, which just consists


482
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,366
of scaling the view,
adding a shadow,


483
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,816
and changing the
background color.


484
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,166
If the previously focused
item is our control,


485
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:12,006
then we'll configure the
unfocused view or appearance,


486
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,276
which just rests all
of our properties.


487
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:16,386
Now before I run this,


488
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,626
I also want to add motion
effects to our control.


489
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,076
Motion effects makes your
app feel more responsive


490
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:24,906
and helps the user find
the focus item on screen.


491
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,646
So to do that, I'll
create a motionEffectGroup


492
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:31,956
to add horizontal and vertical
motion when I move my finger


493
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:32,866
around the touch surface.


494
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,836
Now I need to go back, and when
our control becomes focused,


495
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:41,116
I will add the motion effect,
and when it becomes unfocused,


496
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:43,216
I will remove the motion effect.


497
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,156
Now I make all these changes


498
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:47,466
within addCoordinatedAnimations
block.


499
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:51,206
This way, our property
changes are in sync


500
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,516
with our focus animations.


501
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,976
So let's see how this looks.


502
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:07,126
All right, so what we've done


503
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:10,576
so far is create a very basic
control which has both a focus


504
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,266
and unfocused appearance
and has motion effects.


505
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,526
So it moves when I move my
finger on the touch surface.


506
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,936
But this is supposed to be
a five-star rating control


507
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:20,336
and we don't have any stars yet.


508
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:25,326
So let's go add those.


509
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,186
So first we need to
add some properties


510
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,406
to store our control state.


511
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:31,466
And then in our awakeFromNib
function,


512
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:37,616
we'll add a horizontal stackView
and add five stars to that.


513
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:41,356
I've already created the star
classes to save some time,


514
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:42,506
but if you're following along,


515
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:45,126
I configured their focus
appearance using the same


516
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,366
process that we just saw.


517
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:50,596
Now when the user selects the
control, I want them to be able


518
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,666
to edit the current rating.


519
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,546
So I'll add a
selectGestureRecognizer


520
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,876
to our control.


521
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:59,226
And when that's triggered,
I'll toggle the editing state


522
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,426
and request a focus update.


523
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,956
When a focus update happens,


524
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,796
it consults our
preferredFocusEnvironments.


525
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:06,286
So we'll override that property.


526
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:09,986
And if we're editing,
we'll return our starViews


527
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,486
as our
preferredFocusEnvironments.


528
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:14,706
Otherwise, we'll just return
our super implementation.


529
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:17,566
Let's run this, see
how it looks.


530
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:26,876
Okay, so this time
when our app launched,


531
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,516
we have some stars
in our control.


532
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:32,406
And when I select the control,
focus moves to the first star


533
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:35,296
within the control; however,
I'm not actually able


534
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,466
to move focus to
the other stars.


535
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:40,686
This is because there's some
space between the stars.


536
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:43,636
So when we try to move focus
to the right, we actually end


537
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:46,626
up focusing on our control,
which just directs focus back


538
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:49,106
to our first star using
preferredFocusEnvironments.


539
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:52,916
So to fix this, we want to
make sure our control is not


540
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,546
focusable when we're editing.


541
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:58,416
So let's override
canBecomeFocused


542
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:02,126
and we'll return false if our
control is currently editing.


543
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:05,946
So let's run this, see
if that fixes things.


544
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,006
All right, that's much better.


545
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,426
So now I'll able to move
focus between the stars.


546
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:19,526
But it's difficult to tell
what the current rating is


547
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:21,536
because we don't provide
any visual feedback.


548
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:25,226
So to do that, we need to
update the current rating


549
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,516
when our focus changes.


550
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:30,986
So let's go back to our
didUpdateFocus function,


551
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:33,776
and at the bottom,
if we're editing,


552
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,476
we'll set the current
rating based on the index


553
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,166
of the currently
focused starView.


554
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,376
And let's go back up to
our current rating property


555
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:46,466
and we'll tie that directly


556
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,896
to the isSelected
property on the starViews.


557
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:51,866
And this property just sets the
background color on the stars.


558
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,976
So let's see how that looks.


559
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:07,076
Okay, so now when I select
the control, it's easy to tell


560
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,146
that the first star is selected.


561
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,926
And when I move focus, all the
star select remain selected.


562
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,056
So it's easy to tell what
the current rating is.


563
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,226
So this is pretty good
but it's not great yet.


564
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,776
Right now I'm able to move
focus outside the control,


565
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,686
and I don't want
to be able to do


566
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:24,496
that when I'm editing
the current rating.


567
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:27,646
Also, when I select the control,


568
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:30,266
we always reset the current
rating back to one star.


569
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,946
I think it would be better
if we kept the current rating


570
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:35,046
and just focused on
the last selected star.


571
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:37,416
So let's go make those changes.


572
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:44,616
So we'll start by overriding
the shouldUpdateFocus


573
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,936
to restrict focus movement.


574
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:50,266
So if we're editing and the
next focus item is not one


575
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,386
of our star views,
then we'll return false


576
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:56,156
to say no, focus can't move.


577
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:59,476
Also, in our
preferredFocusEnvironments code,


578
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:05,336
we want to return our last
selected star if we're editing


579
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,326
and the current rating
is greater than zero.


580
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,916
So this way we don't reset
the current rating every time.


581
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,956
Let's run this one more
time, see how it looks.


582
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:22,606
Okay, now I'm no longer able


583
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:24,656
to move focus outside
of the control.


584
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,336
And when I select a control, the
current rating stays the same


585
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:30,686
and we just focus on
the last selected star.


586
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,706
So that completes
our custom control.


587
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,606
By utilizing the Focus
APIs, we were able


588
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:39,116
to create a pretty complex
yet very useful control.


589
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,836
Now I'd like to invite
Matt back up on stage.


590
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:47,676
[ Applause ]


591
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:48,776
>> Thanks, Brandon.


592
00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:51,476
I rate that demo
with five stars.


593
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:58,966
Okay, we chose that demo
because it was a great example


594
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:02,096
of using many different parts
of the Focus API in order


595
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:05,126
to create a rich focus
interaction experience.


596
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,116
And there are just a couple
parts of the implementation


597
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:11,746
that Brandon showed us that
I want to highlight again


598
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,926
because they're important


599
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,036
for really creating a
great user experience.


600
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,316
The first tip we have is
to subclass UIControl.


601
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:23,436
UIControl provides a lot of
basic functionality for free,


602
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:26,646
for instance, as Brandon said,
defining the focusability


603
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,756
of your controls based on
its IsEnabled property.


604
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:33,196
So when you're building
custom controls,


605
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:36,276
you should also subclass
from UIControl.


606
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,846
We also used the focus
animation coordinator in order


607
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:45,276
to define our focus-related
animation changes


608
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,976
when changing our focus state.


609
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,296
This is also really
important for making sure


610
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,166
that our focus animations
stay in sync


611
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,966
with other focus animations
happening in other parts


612
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:55,926
of the user interface.


613
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:59,706
And we do this to make sure
that focus naturally flows


614
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:01,926
around the screen when
the user is moving


615
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,096
between different controls.


616
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,476
So when you're defining
animations


617
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:06,786
for your focus appearance,


618
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:09,636
please use the focus
animation coordinator.


619
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:14,746
And the last tip is
to use motion effects.


620
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,056
Brandon showed us how
to use motion effects


621
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:19,406
to create a little
bit of movement


622
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:23,816
when you place your thumb on the
Siri Remote and do a little bit


623
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,896
of movement but not enough
to actually move focus.


624
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,456
You can use the UIMotionEffect's
API


625
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,136
to implement this
behavior very easily.


626
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:36,046
This is important because
it allows your users


627
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,056
to get this direct
connection to your app


628
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,686
so that they get
immediate feedback as soon


629
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,436
as they start using
the Siri Remote.


630
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:46,076
It also helps the user
locate focus on the screen


631
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:48,036
so that they can sit down
in front of their TV,


632
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:49,816
wiggle the remote around,


633
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:53,006
and immediately the
focus element pops out.


634
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:57,206
Before we wrap us, just
a few notes on testing.


635
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:03,046
The first is to point out that
not all input devices have the


636
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,256
same capabilities.


637
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,286
And this is definitely
important when it comes


638
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,796
to testing your custom controls.


639
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:11,746
Now the good news is that
if you use the Focus API


640
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:15,076
to build your custom controls,
like we did in this demo,


641
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,346
then your control should work
with any of the input devices


642
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,456
that we talked about
earlier: Game controllers,


643
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:25,536
Bluetooth keyboards, the Siri
Remote, all of those other ones.


644
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:28,836
But not all these input devices
have the same capabilities


645
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:31,126
so that if your custom
control relies


646
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,526
on some custom event handling
or gesture recognition,


647
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,496
for example, let's say


648
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:40,176
for example you're
using the Siri Remote


649
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:42,866
which generates touch events
from its touch surface


650
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:46,526
and you're using that
to drive some capability


651
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:47,686
within your custom control,


652
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,316
well if a user is using
a Bluetooth keyboard,


653
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,106
they can't generate
those touch events.


654
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,016
And so you'll have to do
some extra work to make sure


655
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:58,216
that your control can behave
correctly and be functional


656
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,686
for all users, in
all situations.


657
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:03,606
And so definitely
test custom controls


658
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:08,116
that use custom event handling
with different input devices.


659
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:11,186
Try out a Bluetooth keyboard,
pick up a game controller,


660
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:14,315
very important to maintaining
a good user experience.


661
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:18,696
And finally, please,
please test your controls


662
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:19,636
with accessibility.


663
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:23,295
The good news here is that the
Focus engine again does some


664
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:23,956
work for you.


665
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:28,606
For example, if the user wants
a high-contrast user interface,


666
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:31,886
the Focus engine will
helpfully put an extra ring


667
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,545
around the currently focused
item to really make it pop


668
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,856
out on the screen and
make it easier to see.


669
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:40,815
But for other accessibility
features, such as VoiceOver,


670
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:43,735
you're going to have the do
the same kinds of custom work


671
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,676
that you're used to
on iOS to make sure


672
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,906
that your controls
behave well on tvOS.


673
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:53,235
And so please test your controls
with features like VoiceOver


674
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,815
to make sure that they behavior
really well in all situations.


675
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:01,336
So that's our talk today.


676
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,626
We introduced two
new API properties,


677
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:07,156
preferredFocusEnvironments and
restoresFocusAfterTransition


678
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:10,316
to help manage preferred
focus in your app.


679
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,936
We also announced the new
focus interaction support


680
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:16,516
for SpriteKit and we think this
will really help reduce the


681
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:18,106
complexity of your
SpriteKit games.


682
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:21,756
And finally, we took you through
an in-depth case study on how


683
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:25,036
to build a custom focusable
control using our five star


684
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:25,746
rating control.


685
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,236
Now before we leave today,


686
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,716
we'd like to mention some
great online resources


687
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:31,666
to help you learn more.


688
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,516
Specifically, you
should definitely check


689
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,806
out the Apple TV
Tech Talks from 2016.


690
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,976
These cover -- these are
our videos available online.


691
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:43,586
They cover a wide array
of topics that are good


692
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:46,296
for people getting new to
the platform but also good


693
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,976
if you've had some experience
building for tvOS already.


694
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:53,356
Specifically, there's one
section, Focus-Driven Interfaces


695
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:56,256
with UIKit that goes
more in-depth into some


696
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,216
of the more basic
aspects of the Focus API,


697
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:02,416
some of the basic concepts,
an in-depth overview of some


698
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,306
of the parts of the API
that we didn't cover today.


699
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,716
It talks about some best
practices and also tools


700
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,326
and debugging support, which
we have available to help you


701
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:11,246
with building your apps.


702
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:14,096
You can find these
talks here at this URL.


703
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:17,996

that you should check out.


707
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,916
If you're building games
with SpriteKit, definitely go


708
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,726
to the What's New in SpriteKit
session, where we also talk


709
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:32,676
about how to specifically
opt in your SpriteKit games


710
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:36,836
for focus support and then also
check out the What's New in tvOS


711
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,096
in Mastering UIKit
on tvOS sessions


712
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:41,586
to really take your UIKit
apps to the next level.


713
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:43,866
And of course, have
a great conference.
