00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:20,976
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:21,976
Welcome to our --

00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,066
[ Audience Applause ]


5
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:23,426
Thank you.


6
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:23,906
Thank you.


7
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:25,746
It's great to be here.


8
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:26,986
Thanks everybody for coming.


9
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:29,026
Welcome to our session on


10
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:31,386
Introducing Podcast Analytics.


11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,196
I'm James Boggs.


12
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,386
I manage the Business Team for


13
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,016
Apple Podcasts and Siri Audio


14
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,026
Briefs, and we've got a great


15
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:40,096
session planned for you today.


16
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,116
First, I'm going to share some


17
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,456
details of our podcast business


18
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,086
over the last year, including


19
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,136
some very interesting and


20
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:48,486
exciting milestones.


21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,306
Then I'm going to welcome Anne


22
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:52,776
Wootton from our Engineering


23
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,356
Team to the stage, and she's


24
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:55,326
going to take us through some


25
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:57,976
updates to Podcast app for iOS


26
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:58,266
12.


27
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,176
After Anne, Alec Reitter will


28
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,046
take us through a demo of


29
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,166
Podcast Analytics, and then we


30
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,296
will finish up with Anne sharing


31
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:12,796
some requirements and taking a


32
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,306
look at resources available to


33
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:15,396
podcast makers.


34
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,746
First off, an update on our


35
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,106
podcast business.


36
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,676
Well, we're just shy of the 13th


37
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,756
Anniversary of the launch of


38
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,026
iTunes 4.9.


39
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,926
That's the moment when we took


40
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,166
podcasts mainstream for the


41
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,866
first time, and podcasts have


42
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:36,426
come a long way since then.


43
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:38,936
Our content catalogue has never


44
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:40,116
been more entertaining,


45
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,576
inspiring, and educational, and


46
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:43,746
we've never reached more


47
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,036
listeners around the world than


48
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:46,956
we do right now.


49
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,076
We're reaching them with some


50
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,896
great programming like Sandra


51
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:52,706
from Gimlet.


52
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,866
This is a brand new program from


53
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,266
one of the leading independent


54
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,936
podcast networks out of New


55
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,676
York, and it stars some really


56
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,706
big talent, Kristen Wiig, Alia


57
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,276
Shawkat, and Ethan Hawk.


58
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,626
It's a really fun scripted


59
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,256
comedy drama about the inner


60
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,226
workings and quirks of a virtual


61
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,946
assistant.


62
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,066
Los Angeles-based Wondery is one


63
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,906
of adventure capital backed


64
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,786
network startups working in


65
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,986
podcast today, and last year,


66
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:24,696
Wondery collaborated with the LA


67
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,676
Times to produce the thrilling


68
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:29,146
true crime story of a charming


69
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,736
but sociopathic con man, Dirty


70
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,106
John.


71
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,686
The Hollywood-style production


72
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,686
value is powerful investigative


73
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,156
journalism and remarkable


74
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,556
storytelling, which is just


75
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:41,186
riveting.


76
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:42,756
It drove this show to the top of


77
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,736
the charts in the US several of


78
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:45,976
the markets around the world.


79
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,456
If you haven't had a chance to


80
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,006
check it out, I recommend it.


81
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,976
It's a great binge.


82
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,096
And of course, podcast fans


83
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:56,516
everywhere are thrilled and


84
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,986
enjoying Oprah's Super Soul


85
00:02:58,986 --> 00:02:59,896
Conversations.


86
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,496
This is the audio instalment of


87
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,396
the Queen of Talks iconic


88
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,776
interview franchise, and we were


89
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,256
overjoyed to have Oprah on Apple


90
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:08,946
Podcast.


91
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,666
These examples are just three of


92
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,096
the more than 550,000 shows


93
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,406
available today on Apple


94
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,026
Podcast.


95
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:20,246
That's quite a bit more content


96
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,476
to listen to than the original


97
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:23,416
3,000 programs we launched with


98
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,966
back in 2005.


99
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,456
We're continually refreshing and


100
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:29,836
managing our directory,


101
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,846
automatically retiring shows


102
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:32,966
which become technically


103
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,666
unavailable or those that run


104
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,696
afoul of our directory content


105
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,766
guidelines, such as those with


106
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:41,026
spammy content or shows seeking


107
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,786
to manipulate our top charts.


108
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:43,916
Don't do that.


109
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,976
Just please don't do that.


110
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,856
At the same time as we're


111
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,506
managing the directory, we're


112
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,006
accepting thousands of new


113
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,196
submissions per week.


114
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,286
That way, our catalogue is


115
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,236
continually refreshed, and our


116
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,546
users around the world can


117
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,976
always find something great to


118
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,046
listen to.


119
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:03,646
Amongst those more than 550,000


120
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,886
active shows, we have over 18.5


121
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,956
million episodes of content.


122
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,406
That's more than 8 million hours


123
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,066
of programming.


124
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,496
So, you'd better, better start


125
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,226
listening, better start


126
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:14,636
bingeing.


127
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:18,366
As a reminder, Apple Podcast is


128
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:21,065
available in 155 countries.


129
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,456
That's not only for the


130
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:24,626
distribution of existing shows


131
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,076
but for the submission and


132
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,706
acceptance of new programming


133
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:28,926
from each one of those markets.


134
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,756
The Podcast Directory serves an


135
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,746
audience in all 155 of those


136
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,756
countries with content in more


137
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:38,086
than 100 languages.


138
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,176
So, that means if you're a


139
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,436
Korean native speaker, ex-pat,


140
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,896
living in Toronto, you can find


141
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,446
some great audio programming


142
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:47,866
from home right in Apple


143
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,116
Podcast, and we're particularly


144
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,206
proud of this, particularly


145
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,826
proud to have such a diverse


146
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,396
catalogue and be one of the


147
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:56,626
easiest ways to reach a global


148
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,376
audience for audio programming


149
00:04:58,376 --> 00:04:59,626
that there is.


150
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:03,676
The data from our beta version


151
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,616
of Podcasts Analytics shows some


152
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,566
remarkable listener affinity and


153
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,096
engagement.


154
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,926
We looked at several hundred of


155
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,006
our recent top episodes, those


156
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,496
with more than 7 days of


157
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,426
playback data, and we found some


158
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,606
really notable average


159
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:18,226
consumption.


160
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,196
Of course, this data is


161
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,066
nonamized [phonetic] and


162
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,326
aggregated and a sample, so no


163
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:25,286
personally identifiable


164
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:26,606
information is included, and


165
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,006
it's not a comprehensive


166
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,536
statistic but interesting


167
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,146
nonetheless.


168
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,626
It shows that once an episode is


169
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,286
started, on average, about 80%


170
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,826
of that episode content was


171
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:37,396
consumed.


172
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,256
This is great stuff and a real


173
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,336
testament to the affinity and


174
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:42,946
engagement the podcast audience


175
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,576
has with this high quality


176
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:46,276
content.


177
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,896
Last fall, we successfully


178
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,886
integrated more than 50,000


179
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,226
iTunes U collections into Apple


180
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:53,976
Podcasts.


181
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,196
This is content from some of the


182
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,936
world's best educational


183
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,966
institutions, including


184
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:02,546
developing iOS 11 apps with SWF


185
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:04,376
from Stanford's Paul Haggerty.


186
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:06,816
Naturally, we're eager for the


187
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,006
new instalment of this class


188
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,186
series later this year.


189
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,446
As part of Apple Podcast,


190
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,836
teachers can now leverage the


191
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:17,016
episode serial ordering support


192
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:17,966
in Podcast app.


193
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,306
They can reach a new broader


194
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,526
audience of lifelong learners


195
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,616
around the world, and it can


196
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,266
distribute the content on tvOS


197
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,306
for the first time.


198
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,296
We're seeing some great use of


199
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,256
modern podcast tags, which we


200
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,576
introduced last year right here


201
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,336
on stage at WWDC.


202
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,306
Many podcasts include trailers


203
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,586
to thematically introduce the


204
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,346
feel and sound of their show.


205
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,286
This is the best way really to


206
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,636
launch a new podcast, and ESPN,


207
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:50,136
for example, makes great use of


208
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,006
trailers and, in addition, is


209
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,636
amongst the chart shopping shows


210
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:56,036
that uses seasons and bonus


211
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:56,576
content.


212
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,646
This allows Jody Avragon


213
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,416
[phonetic] and the team to


214
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,506
easily present the thematically


215
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:02,826
different collections of


216
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,126
episodes in each season.


217
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,956
In addition to seasons and bonus


218
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,386
content, 30 for 30 feeds their


219
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,756
super fans with bonus episodes.


220
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,596
These complement the full season


221
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:14,166
episodes.


222
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,556
A best practice regarding bonus


223
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,776
content is to make sure that


224
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,966
your bonus episodes are tagged


225
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,496
appropriately to the full season


226
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:23,096
episodes.


227
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,386
Just want to ensure proper


228
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,116
ordering of the content in Apple


229
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:26,796
Podcasts.


230
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:28,916
And of course, episode number,


231
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,026
we're using this handy reference


232
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,146
for your audience inside Podcast


233
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:33,366
app.


234
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,366
We're also making use of episode


235
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,806
numbers that you provide in your


236
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:39,036
RSS feed in Podcast Analytics.


237
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,926

238
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:45,166
venture-backed hosting startups


239
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,036
has started to grow.


240
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,136
Organizations such as Anchor,


241
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,506

Canada, France, and Germany is


263
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,696
an awesome podcast machine.


264
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:35,816

podcast playback, so you can


266
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,676

our own Apple Music Team.


283
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,496
We're thrilled to celebrate the


284
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,416
incredible milestone of 50


285
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,196
billion episode downloads and


286
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,366
streams on Apple Podcasts since


287
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,336
the launch of the service in


288
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,176
2005.


289
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,826
With over 10.5 billion episode


290
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,456
downloads and streaming plays in


291
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:30,046
2016 and more than 13.7 billion


292
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:31,876
last year, the growth trajectory


293
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:34,116
of the platform is amazing.


294
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,256
We're also thrilled that the


295
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,456
shows that are driving all this


296
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:41,156
consumption are of such a high


297
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,826
quality, and it's a pleasure for


298
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,056
us to be able to champion this


299
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,206
content on top of our platform.


300
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,156
We celebrate the podcasts that


301
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,566
contribute to this 50 billion


302
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,896
milestone, and one show in


303
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,946
particular, "Stuff You Should


304
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:55,716
Know" from Atlantis How Stuff


305
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,326
Works Network, the first


306
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,616
podcast, an Apple podcast to


307
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,836
exceed 500 million downloads and


308
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:02,456
streams.


309
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,446
Wow! Congratulations to Chuck,


310
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,046
Josh, Jerry, and the rest of the


311
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:06,466
team.


312
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,056
Well done!


313
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,436
We're looking forward to the


314
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,216
next half billion downloads and


315
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:10,666
streams.


316
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,826
So, with that business update,


317
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,966
let me welcome Anne to the stage


318
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,366
to take us through our app.


319
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:23,606
[ Audience Applause ]


320
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,186
>> Thanks, James.


321
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,626
Thanks James, and hi.


322
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,196
I'm Anne, and I run Podcasts


323
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,076
Engineering at Apple.


324
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,236
Before we dive much deeper into


325
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,536
analytics, I want to highlight a


326
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,066
few of the latest updates to the


327
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,906
podcast app.


328
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,236
As you probably heard in


329
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,516
yesterday's keynote, we are


330
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,976
thrilled to be launching


331
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,846
podcasts for Apple Watch this


332
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,166
fall.


333
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,966
It was one of the most requested


334
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,986
features for Apple Watch and for


335
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:51,396
good reason.


336
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,146
Between HomePod and Apple Watch,


337
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,806
listening to podcasts has never


338
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,166
been easier or more hands free.


339
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,836
We're also really excited to


340
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:02,996
share that we've enhanced our


341
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,366
support for chapters in the


342
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,956
podcast app.


343
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,556
In the upcoming IRS release,


344
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,116
we're extending full chapter


345
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,806
support to MP3s.


346
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,486
In addition to enabling


347
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,046
podcasters to segment their


348
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,266
episodes into shorter discrete


349
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,086
chapters, this functionality


350
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:21,316
also includes chapter art that


351
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,816
displays as the play head


352
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,426
advances across chapters.


353
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:26,596
So, podcasters can supplement


354
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,496
their audio with visual content.


355
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,786
In the upcoming iOS release,


356
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:34,856
we're also offering an improved


357
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:35,986
experience for podcast


358
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,856
notifications.


359
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:38,996
The new podcast notifications


360
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,696
are grouped across shows and


361
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:42,406
episodes into a single


362
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:45,266
expandable stack that reduces


363
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,596
clutter on screen, and we also


364
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,876
provide one-tap access to


365
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,596
notification settings for all of


366
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:53,236
your shows.


367
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,116
That means if you only want to


368
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:56,536
get notifications for your


369
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,576
favorite show, 99% invisible,


370
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,616
it's as simple as toggling the


371
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,426
switches on this single settings


372
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:02,826
page.


373
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:07,676
So, last year, at WWDC, we


374
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,196
announced that Apple would be


375
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,946
launching Podcast Analytics for


376
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:11,696
the first time.


377
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:13,856
We were super excited to launch


378
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,506
at the end of 2017, and Podcast


379
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,426
Analytics is available in beta


380
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,846
right now today to anyone with a


381
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,226
podcast in our catalogue.


382
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,136
We know that this is a service


383
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,376
that was long desired and speaks


384
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,626
to a critical need in the


385
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,156
industry as evidence by work


386
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:33,756
like the remote audio data spec


387
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,586
being spearheaded by NPR.


388
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,556
So, it's important to us that we


389
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,326
provide this anonymous data back


390
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,076
to publishers to help them


391
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,266
better understand how their


392
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,946
audiences are consuming their


393
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:46,276
audio.


394
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,156
And all of the data and


395
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,576
analytics is based on the use of


396
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,496
the update Apple podcasts app


397
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:57,076
from iOS 11 and iTunes 12.7.


398
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,206
We're collecting data only from


399
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,736
those operating systems, Forward


400
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,656
and the Analytic Dashboard


401
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,296
includes listening data from


402
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,956
HomePod, AppleTV, and will


403
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,466
include Apple Watch listening


404
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,326
data starting in watchOS 5.


405
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,476
As you know, privacy is really


406
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,346
important to Apple, and we are


407
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,156
only showing aggregate data of


408
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,736
those users who have agreed to


409
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,996
use the podcast app.


410
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,356
It is anonymous, not personally


411
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:28,246
identifiable, not tied to your


412
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:29,896
Apple ID, and we only reflect


413
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,426
the data points in aggregate


414
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:32,456
that we've collected from at


415
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:34,166
least five unique devices.


416
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,626
And it couldn't be easier to get


417
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:37,986
started.


418
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,466
You don't need to write any


419
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,746
code, you don't need to use an


420
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,416
SDK, and it's totally free.


421
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,636
If you have a podcast, all you


422
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,796
have to do is submit your feed


423
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,526
to Podcast Connect after you


424
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,046
signed in, get it approved, get


425
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:53,116
some listeners, then check your


426
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:54,446
performance through the Podcast


427
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:55,716
Analytics dashboard.


428
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,276
Analytics reports the data from


429
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,366
unique devices that engage with


430
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,926
the Podcasts app.


431
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,166
As my colleague, Alec, is about


432
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,596
to show us from the Analytics


433
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,706
Dashboard, publishers can access


434
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,886
an overview that includes tables


435
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,046
and charts with data-like unique


436
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,556
device counts for a selected


437
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,086
period of time, total time


438
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:20,586
listened, time per device,


439
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,146
average consumption, top


440
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:24,426
countries, and more.


441
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,816
So, some of you may be familiar


442
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,306
with our podcast, The Very


443
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,446
Hungry Tourists.


444
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,336
They're back for season 2, and


445
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:35,736
they even have some new cover


446
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,196
art.


447
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:38,296
Alec is going to take you on a


448
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,656
deeper dive of how to get the


449
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,176
most out of analytics.


450
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,666
We're excited to continue


451
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,196
providing key listening metrics


452
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,636
for this industry, and we are


453
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,846
listening to your feedback and


454
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,626
continuing to improve the


455
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,096
service.


456
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,116
So, thank you.


457
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,256
And with that, I'm going to hand


458
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,546
it over to Alec to take us on a


459
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:54,976
tour of Podcast Analytics.


460
00:14:55,516 --> 00:15:03,736
[ Audience Applause ]


461
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:04,866
>> Thank you, Anne.


462
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,216
So, podcasters, every day you're


463
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,846
hard at work making great shows


464
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,416
and episodes for people to enjoy


465
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,256
all over the world.


466
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,326
But how much do you know about


467
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:16,026
your audience?


468
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,276
Do you know how many listeners


469
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,986
you have or how much they


470
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,386
listen?


471
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,356
Do you know where they are


472
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,236
around the world?


473
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:25,956
What are their favorite


474
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:26,516
episodes?


475
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,966
With Podcast Analytics, Apple


476
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:31,146
offers you transparency into how


477
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,296
your show is heard, so you can


478
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,666
better understand your listeners


479
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,106
and create the best show for


480
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:36,766
your audience.


481
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,076
My name is Alec Reitter, and I'm


482
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,596
going to do a walkthrough and


483
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,306
demo of Podcast Analytics.


484
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:44,616
So, let's get started by heading


485
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:45,606
to the login page.


486
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,946
When you see this bright purple


487
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,316
page, you know you've made it to


488
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,056
the right place.


489
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,156
Here, we're going to login with


490
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:55,006
the Apple ID that we used to


491
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,926
originally submit the podcast


492
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,056
feed to the Apple Podcast


493
00:15:59,056 --> 00:15:59,496
catalogue.


494
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:02,746
Now, if you have any trouble,


495
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,486
such as you forget your password


496
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,966
for your Apple ID, or you don't


497
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,216
know which Apple ID to use, or


498
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,656
if after you've logged in you


499
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:12,826
don't see all the shows you


500
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:15,716
expect to see, go to the top


501
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,086
right corner of this page and


502
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:18,196
click on that question mark


503
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:18,616
icon.


504
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,546
That will take you to Resources


505
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,256
and Help, and there you can find


506
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:23,926
Contact this Link, where people


507
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:25,046
can give you the assistance you


508
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:25,256
need.


509
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,896
In this example, we're going to


510
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,846
use John Appleseed's login


511
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,486
credentials.


512
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,776
So, let's login now and see what


513
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,086
he sees when he enters Podcast


514
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:35,506
Analytics.


515
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:43,486
So, this is the show's page.


516
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,466
Here, we see five shows for


517
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,146
John's account.


518
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,796
In this table, there are three


519
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,316
metrics, and we're going to take


520
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:54,356
a look at those in a minute, and


521
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,426
all of the data in this table is


522
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:58,016
driven by the date picker, which


523
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,106
is in the top right corner.


524
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,686
Right now, it's set to the last


525
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,226
60 days, and that is the


526
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:02,656
default.


527
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,126
So, let's take a look at the top


528
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,925
row for The Very Hungry


529
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,566
Tourists.


530
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,606
Here, we can see the number of


531
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:12,356
unique devices for the last 60


532
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:12,646
days.


533
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,986
This answers the question, how


534
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,165
many listeners do I have?


535
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,556
Here we see 256,000 unique


536
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:20,195
devices.


537
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,016
Next to that, we can answer the


538
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,705
question, how much do they


539
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:25,126
listen?


540
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:26,996
In this case, the total time


541
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:31,636
listened is 327,000 total hours.


542
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,626
Now, if we do a little math, we


543
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,016
can find the average, which is


544
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,256
the time per device of 1 hour


545
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,396
and 17 minutes.


546
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,256
So, this is a very popular show.


547
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:42,406
It's doing really well.


548
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,466
So, next, we're going to switch


549
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,656
tabs from the show's tab to the


550
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,976
episodes tab.


551
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,996
Here, we can see a cross-section


552
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:58,176
of episodes across all of the


553
00:17:58,176 --> 00:17:59,226
shows in John's account.


554
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:01,556
Here, we see a few of the most


555
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,006
recently released episodes.


556
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,096
Now, this data table has a lot


557
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,436
more information in it, and


558
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,196
let's take a look at the top


559
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:10,606
row.


560
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,906
This is the most recent episode


561
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,136
from The Very Hungry Tourists,


562
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,056
starting on the right-hand side,


563
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,946
we can see the name of the


564
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,426
episode, then the name of the


565
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:24,026
show, and now, the third column


566
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,046
is the episode column.


567
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,686
If you're making use of the new


568
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,746
tags, like season, episode, and


569
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,586
episode type, they'll show up


570
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:30,876
here.


571
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:33,246
Following that, we have the


572
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,646
release date and then the


573
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,326
duration.


574
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,016
So, in this case, it's a


575
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,466
35-minute long episode.


576
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,036
If, when you login, you don't


577
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,146
see the right number in the


578
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:45,086
duration column, it's because of


579
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:46,136
what you have in your feed.


580
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,626
We pulled this number straight


581
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,226
from your feed.


582
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,866
So, make sure it's accurate.


583
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:53,026
Following the duration column,


584
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,286
we see three columns that we've


585
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:56,116
seen before, except this time,


586
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:57,976
for this episode specifically.


587
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,006
So, we have devices, total time


588
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,556
listened, and time per device.


589
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:04,916
And for the first time, we see


590
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,006
average consumption.


591
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,626
This is the last metric in the


592
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:08,576
far right column.


593
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:11,326
Average consumption is really


594
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,686
great because it's really just


595
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,056
another way of looking at time


596
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:14,826
per device.


597
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,586
So, in this case, it's 28 minute


598
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,846
for this 35-minute long episode.


599
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:21,856
That is 81%.


600
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:23,286
What's nice about average


601
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,996
consumption is it allows us to


602
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,786
compare episodes of differing


603
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:29,096
durations against each other to


604
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:30,446
really get a sense of how


605
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:31,906
healthy each episode is doing.


606
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:37,036
And from here, let's click


607
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,626
through on the Show Title and


608
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,186
look at the show overview for


609
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,496
The Very Hungry Tourists.


610
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,836
So, here's the show overview.


611
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:48,426
There's a lot going on here.


612
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,526
Let's start at the top.


613
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,636
Across the top, we have three


614
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:53,606
headline numbers.


615
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:54,756
These are the same numbers that


616
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,236
we saw before in the shows


617
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,606
table, but now we have a mini


618
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,086
time series underneath these


619
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,596
numbers to give you a sense of


620
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:03,616
how things are doing.


621
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,776
Maybe you can see, just looking


622
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,676
at that little line, if your


623
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,756
show is getting more or fewer


624
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,206
listeners over time.


625
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,776
Now, let's look beneath this row


626
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,746
and take a look at the chart on


627
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:20,516
the left here.


628
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,606
This is the donut chart of total


629
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:23,216
time listened.


630
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,836
So, for all of the time spent


631
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,866
listening to your show, were


632
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,966
those devices subscribed or not


633
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:33,526
subscribed?


634
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,446
Here, we can see that 83% of


635
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,706
that 328,000 total hours of


636
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:39,896
listening was done by a


637
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:42,776
subscribed device versus 17% not


638
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:43,246
subscribed.


639
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,166
So, these are pretty good


640
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:45,636
numbers.


641
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,036
But why might these numbers be


642
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,046
different when you take a look


643
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:49,996
at your data?


644
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:53,396
Well, if you have a very small


645
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,076
podcast, one with a very


646
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,516
dedicated following, you might


647
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,676
not have too many new listeners,


648
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,946
but your subscribed count might


649
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:04,236
be above 90, even 95%.


650
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:07,466
Conversely, if you're doing a


651
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,956
lot of marketing or promotion,


652
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:11,966
or your show is growing rapidly,


653
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,376
you're not subscribed count


654
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,506
might be fairly high.


655
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,656
Now, when somebody first starts


656
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:20,786
to listen to your show,


657
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,006
obviously, they're not going to


658
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,576
be subscribed most of the time.


659
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,336
But once they hear what you have


660
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,796
and they hit that "Subscribe"


661
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:29,096
button, that's when they end up


662
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,976
in the other bucket.


663
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:33,716
Now, let's take a look at the


664
00:21:33,716 --> 00:21:34,846
chart to the right.


665
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:36,066
This is the Top Countries by


666
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:36,556
Device.


667
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:37,876
Here, we can see the top five


668
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:38,876
countries for the show.


669
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,066
As we can see, the United States


670
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,566
comprises the majority of the


671
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,426
listening at 78%.


672
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:47,936
If we look at the fifth spot, we


673
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:48,716
see Brazil.


674
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:50,726
Now, what's neat about this is


675
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,176
that Brazil wasn't on this top


676
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,246
five before, but as Anne said


677
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,636
earlier, this is season 2 of The


678
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:59,156
Very Hungry Tourists, and on the


679
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:00,676
first episode of this season,


680
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:01,636
they actually went down to


681
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:02,226
Brazil.


682
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:03,946
They did some marketing and


683
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:07,296
promotion, and it's starting to


684
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,156
pay off.


685
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,526
So, next, let's scroll down to


686
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:13,076
the bottom of the page, and here


687
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:14,886
we can see the ten most recently


688
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:16,686
released episodes for the show.


689
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,266
This is the same sort of data


690
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,466
table that we saw before for


691
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:22,246
episodes, but this time it's for


692
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:23,126
a single show.


693
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:24,946
What's nice about this is we can


694
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,806
compare apples to apples and


695
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:28,816
really see on an episode by


696
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,886
episode basis how things are


697
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:32,896
turning out.


698
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:34,926
Let's go back up to the top, and


699
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:37,476
we're going to switch from the


700
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,356
Show Overview to add to the


701
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:41,176
Trends tab.


702
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,916
So, here we are in the Trends


703
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:44,166
tab.


704
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,456
This is a Time Series Chart


705
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:49,996
where we can see day by day how


706
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:51,296
many people are tuning into this


707
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:51,706
show.


708
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:53,916
And again, by default, we're


709
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,726
looking at the last 60 days of


710
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:56,046
data.


711
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,846
In the top left corner, we see


712
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,456
that headline number again of


713
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:04,046
256,000 unique devices, and down


714
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:05,706
below the Time Series Chart we


715
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:08,506
see a table with episode titles.


716
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:10,046
We can choose up to five


717
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:11,636
separate episodes to compare


718
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:12,996
against one another in the chart


719
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:13,316
above.


720
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:18,676
So, let's first now talk about


721
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:21,146
all of the different drop downs


722
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,836
that control the chart and what


723
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:24,656
we see in it.


724
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,286
First up, we have a drop-down.


725
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,866
This is the metric that we're


726
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,566
going to chart.


727
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:31,086
By default, we start off with


728
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:33,146
Unique Devices, or you can also


729
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,236
choose to have it render Total


730
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:35,826
Time Listened.


731
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,396
To the right of that, we have


732
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:40,486
another drop-down.


733
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,876
This is what I call the primary


734
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:42,306
filter.


735
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:44,716
By default here, we're looking


736
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,886
at Episode as the primary


737
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,286
filter, but you might want to


738
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,116
choose Country or Subscribed


739
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:50,546
Device.


740
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:52,236
Now, whatever you choose for


741
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:53,566
your primary filter, that's


742
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,826
going to dictate the table


743
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:55,636
beneath the chart.


744
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,926
So, whatever is selected allows


745
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,716
you to choose multiple entries


746
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:00,976
to compare against one another.


747
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,046
For example, we could choose


748
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:04,496
Country, and we'll have


749
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:06,446
countries in that table below.


750
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,566
Whatever filters are not


751
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,716
selected from this menu, they


752
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,476
move over to the right-hand side


753
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:13,386
of the page in their own


754
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:14,076
drop-downs.


755
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,846
For example, countries or


756
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,246
subscription state [phonetic].


757
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,226
For each of these, you can


758
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,446
choose up to one filter.


759
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,926
Now, with that, that's enough


760
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:28,696
talking through slides.


761
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:30,416
Let's look at a demo, and I will


762
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,966
take you back to that page but


763
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:36,046
in a hands-on fashion.


764
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:38,926
So, here we are.


765
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,206
We're in that same view that we


766
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:42,146
saw before of the Trends page.


767
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,596
But now, we can see what happens


768
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:47,386
when I interact with it.


769
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,086
When I move my mouse cursor over


770
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,526
the chart, we have this nice


771
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,526
data legend with details about


772
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,936
the specific point that I'm


773
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:55,546
hovering over.


774
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,356
In this case, I'm looking at May


775
00:24:57,356 --> 00:25:01,006
18th, where 34,000 unique


776
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:02,646
devices tuned in.


777
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:05,516
And I can go down the page, and


778
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:07,006
I'm going to select a few


779
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,626
episodes to chart against each


780
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:09,946
other.


781
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:14,616
We get this nice colorful view,


782
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,226
and as I mouse over, I can also


783
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,846
again see the details of what


784
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:19,586
I'm hovering over.


785
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,306
In this case, I can see episode


786
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:23,536
titles and their corresponding


787
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:26,726
counts for those days.


788
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,176
Now, I'm going to go change my


789
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:31,226
primary filter, and I'm going


790
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:32,506
switch it from Episode to


791
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:32,956
Country.


792
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:36,326
So, this updates the chart once


793
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:36,716
again.


794
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,266
This is the same actual graph


795
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,266
that we saw the first time


796
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:40,836
because now, again, we're


797
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:41,956
looking at all countries.


798
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:44,536
But I'm going to choose the top


799
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:48,026
five countries and compare those


800
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:48,786
against each other.


801
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:51,806
Once again, we get this colorful


802
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:52,186
chart.


803
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,376
But in this particular case,


804
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,076
because the United States


805
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,056
represents so much of the


806
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,976
listening for this show, it


807
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,476
makes it difficult to see the


808
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,396
other countries and how they


809
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:02,486
stack up against each other.


810
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:04,276
So, I'm actually going to go and


811
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,786
deselect the United States.


812
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:08,796
The chart adjusts, and we can


813
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:11,576
really see with more detail how


814
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:14,816
each country is doing.


815
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,716
And now that I can, I'm going to


816
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:20,176
show you the date picker.


817
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,316
It's up here on the top right


818
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:21,706
corner.


819
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,336
By default, it sets at the last


820
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,086
60 days.


821
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,696
You can switch that to weeks or


822
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,226
a specific month, but we'll


823
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,016
leave it at that for now.


824
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,926
Now, there are lots of


825
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,476
combinations that you can make


826
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:36,206
here, but I'm going to move on


827
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,076
after this, but I really


828
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,306
encourage you to take a look at


829
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,506
your shows and see how they're


830
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,316
doing and really play around


831
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:42,786
with this tool.


832
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:44,066
I think it's a lot of fun to


833
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:44,456
use.


834
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,106
So, let's switch over to the


835
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,666
Show Episodes tab, and in this


836
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:49,966
view, we can see the top


837
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,286
episodes or all episodes for the


838
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,066
show, not just the top episodes.


839
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,586
In this case, the show has 11,


840
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,076
11 episodes total.


841
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:00,446
And now, because all episodes


842
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,176
are together in this view, we


843
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,406
have the opportunity now to


844
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:04,706
answer some other questions


845
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,666
like, what are the most popular


846
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,386
episodes?


847
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,396
One way to answer that is by


848
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,016
sorting by the Unique Devices


849
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:12,426
column.


850
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:14,936
When I do that, I can see that,


851
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:17,076
essentially, season 1, episode


852
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:18,766
4, Barcelona, Barbacoa, that is


853
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:21,686
the most popular by devices, by


854
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:22,366
unique devices.


855
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:24,196
But maybe you think that it's


856
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,426
actually total time listened


857
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,296
that should be the determinant


858
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,026
of popularity, so I'm going to


859
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:32,306
sort by that instead, and we see


860
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,416
that it's actually season 2,


861
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,856
episode 1 that takes the top


862
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:36,626
spot.


863
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:38,236
Or for myself, I personally


864
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,556
really like average consumption,


865
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:41,376
so I'm going to sort by that,


866
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:44,216
and I can see that at 89%, the


867
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:45,356
trailer is actually the most


868
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,406
popular episode, which makes


869
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,476
sense because it's a short


870
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:48,976
episode.


871
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:53,606
So, now, we've actually seen all


872
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,266
of the show level views.


873
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:56,846
Now, I'd like to take you into


874
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,706
an episode level view.


875
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,106
So, I'm going to select, I'm


876
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:01,916
going to click through on the


877
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,246
title for the most recently


878
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,196
released episode.


879
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,506
Here's Broken Heirloom.


880
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:08,966
So, it was just released on June


881
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:09,686
1st.


882
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:11,656
Front and center, we see a


883
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,666
timeline chart.


884
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:14,876
This shows you the audience size


885
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,806
over the duration of the


886
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,496
episode; actually, at every five


887
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,686
seconds, and when I hover over


888
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:22,176
the chart, I can see a data


889
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,986
legend again with details about


890
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:25,226
the specific time in the


891
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,816
episode, its total count, and


892
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:27,866
its percentage of the max.


893
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:32,086
And in the top left corner, we


894
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,316
see this headline number for the


895
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:35,726
total number of unique devices.


896
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:37,866
Something to note about this


897
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,076
chart, unlike all the other


898
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:41,126
views on this, in Podcast


899
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,836
Analytics, this chart is


900
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:45,266
actually for all time, not just


901
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,436
a specified date range.


902
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,416
Now, what's really nice to see


903
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,096
here is that, in this case, most


904
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:55,166
of the people who started this


905
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,726
episode actually hung out for


906
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:57,896
the entire duration.


907
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,656
This is a really healthy-looking


908
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,136
episode.


909
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:03,666
And beneath the chart, if I


910
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,006
scroll down a little bit, we can


911
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:08,416
see for the last 60 days the


912
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,506
metrics for this show, for this


913
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:11,676
episode, I should say.


914
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,586
This gives you a more recent


915
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,316
sense of how this episode is


916
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,706
doing, not just all time.


917
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:19,406
And at the very bottom, we see


918
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:20,836
the top ten countries for this


919
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:21,286
episode.


920
00:29:22,236 --> 00:29:23,746
But I'm going to scroll back up


921
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:26,266
and cover two things that I


922
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:27,696
breezed past before.


923
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:30,526
There is a drop-down menu above


924
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,376
that all-time devices number,


925
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,866
and when I click on this, I can


926
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:36,426
see that I can also choose


927
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:38,166
Devices or Total Time Listened.


928
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,246
Now, by choosing either of


929
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,736
those, it will actually take us


930
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,806
into a view which is a time


931
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:45,716
series view, just like the Show


932
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:47,636
Trends page except this time


933
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,016
it's tied specifically to this


934
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:49,436
episode.


935
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,896
And now, the part of this graph


936
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,866
that I like the best is actually


937
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:59,116
the ability to play back the


938
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:01,236
audio while seeing how the


939
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:02,916
audience is reacting over the


940
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,966
duration of the episode.


941
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,696
And I can do this by going down


942
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:07,696
to the bottom left corner of the


943
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:09,266
graph and hitting this Play


944
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:09,636
button.


945
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,206
>> Hey there, Hunger Heads, and


946
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,606
welcome back to another episode


947
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,286
of The Very Hungry Tourists.


948
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:16,906
I'm Maria Sanchez, Ph.D.


949
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:18,236
>> And I'm Johnny Appleseed.


950
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,856
>> In today's episode, we're


951
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:21,466
headed to Brooklyn based Viny's


952
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:21,926
Pizzeria.


953
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:23,876
As we're here, even Johnny's


954
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,786
massive wonder couldn't get in


955
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:26,906
the way of our culinary


956
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:27,286
adventure.


957
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,456
>> I'm still blushing from that


958
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:28,646
one.


959
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,866
>> So, this is actually a very


960
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,546
entertaining episode, so if you


961
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:33,276
get a chance, you should


962
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:34,166
definitely check it out.


963
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,956
But like any basic player, you


964
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:39,976
don't just have to start at the


965
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:40,396
beginning.


966
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,296
You can also click on the


967
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:42,946
timeline to jump ahead to any


968
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:45,486
specific spot in time, and if


969
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,066
you want to fine tune, you can


970
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,726
grab the play head and scrub


971
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:48,856
around.


972
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:50,986
So, I'm actually going to scrub


973
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,366
to the beginning of what looks


974
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,076
like an ad.


975
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,566
And so, just to validate my


976
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:56,876
assumptions, I'm going to move


977
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,586
to just before and take a


978
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,056
listen.


979
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:00,156
>> Five years, you wouldn't


980
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,066
believe it, but in the back


981
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:01,976
there is a big window--


982
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,926
>> As the pizza goes in the


983
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:05,726
oven, let's take a moment to


984
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:06,986
hear about out great sponsors.


985
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,636
>> Just say your hands and face


986
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,186
are smothered with Tahini sauce.


987
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,216
So, what do you do?


988
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,036
>> Get a paper towel.


989
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:12,746
>> Ah, too rough.


990
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:13,296
>> Tissue?


991
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:13,896
>> Too soft.


992
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:14,586
>> What about napkins?


993
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,186
>> That's a great idea.


994
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,266
>> Napkins to you is a new drone


995
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,586
delivery service bringing you


996
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,326
napkins where and whenever you


997
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:21,756
need them.


998
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,246
>> Simply open the app, request


999
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,556
a drop off, and the closest


1000
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:25,786
drone is deployed to your


1001
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:26,326
location.


1002
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:27,926
By typing in promo code


1003
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:28,416
"Hungry."


1004
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,556
You can have your very own


1005
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,766
napkins delivered for just $4.99


1006
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:33,126
per month.


1007
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:34,516
>> Again, that's Napkins to You.


1008
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:36,826
>> So, that's sounds like a


1009
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:38,196
really entertaining ad, and it's


1010
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,926
too bad that some people decided


1011
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,756
to skip it, but if you actually


1012
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:45,416
do the math from before the ad


1013
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:47,966
to the bottom of the ad, it's


1014
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,726
only about a 14% drop, and it


1015
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:50,716
seems like it's a temporary


1016
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:51,016
drop.


1017
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,406
So, it's doing pretty well.


1018
00:31:55,806 --> 00:32:00,566
So, with that, I want to switch


1019
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,166
back to the slide, and I just


1020
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,496
want to say that wraps up the


1021
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:06,556
walk through and demo of Podcast


1022
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:09,096
Analytics for you, and I hope


1023
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,186
that you were able to learn some


1024
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:11,776
things about how this tool works


1025
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,236
and maybe how it can help you


1026
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,756
better understand your audience.


1027
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,216
And Podcast Analytics is in


1028
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:19,366
beta, and we are very interested


1029
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,156
in your feedback.


1030
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:22,816
So, if you submit your feedback


1031
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:23,876
link in the top left corner,


1032
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,696
right next to the beta badge, we


1033
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,066
would love to hear what you


1034
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,956
think about the, about Podcast


1035
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,966
Analytics, and give us your


1036
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:31,426
feedback.


1037
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,456
Thank you.


1038
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:33,916
Now, let's bring it back to


1039
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:33,983
Anne.

[ Audience Applause ]


1041
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:43,996
>> Thanks, Alec.


1042
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,676
That was awesome!


1043
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:46,916
So, that's a walk through


1044
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,876
Podcast Analytics, which, again,


1045
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:51,246
is available to anyone with a


1046
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:52,736
podcast in our catalogue.


1047
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,286
If you haven't used it, try it


1048
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:55,506
out.


1049
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,376
It'll also be at a lab


1050
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,466
immediately following this


1051
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:58,986
session.


1052
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:01,496
So, come find us.


1053
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:03,246
And that's where we are today,


1054
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:04,746
but really we've just begun.


1055
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:06,556
You guys are the reason that we


1056
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:08,356
did this, and we love hearing


1057
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:08,826
from you.


1058
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:10,816
So, keep it coming.


1059
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:12,986
For example, we know that many


1060
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,856
of you want an API or a


1061
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:16,376
subscription and download data


1062
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,416
or geographic demographics with


1063
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,216
more specificity.


1064
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:21,606
We love those suggestions.


1065
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:23,776
We hear you, and we're working


1066
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:24,846
on improving the product in the


1067
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:25,236
future.


1068
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:28,416
We are also going to be asking


1069
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,716
for some things rom you in the


1070
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:32,726
future, including new


1071
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,986
specifications around HTTPS,


1072
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:39,616
pubDates, consistent GUIDs, and


1073
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:42,116
cover art that meets minimum


1074
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,116
required resolution.


1075
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,166
So, for continued access to


1076
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,226
Analytics in the future, you


1077
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,826
will absolutely need to have


1078
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,166
those four things.


1079
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,966
We're also going to be releasing


1080
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,816
some guidelines around best


1081
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,966
practices for audio mastering to


1082
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:58,426
give you a sense of the ranges


1083
00:33:58,426 --> 00:33:59,866
you should be using so that your


1084
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,936
podcast sounds the best it can


1085
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:04,466
on HomePod and within the


1086
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:06,006
context of the Apple Podcast


1087
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:06,536

1088
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:08,306
We'll be sharing these


1089
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:09,716
requirements with you all.


1090
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,146
We will put them in Podcast


1091
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:12,846
Resources at Help so you can


1092
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,726
refer back to them anytime.


1093
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:18,156
And speaking of which, last but


1094
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,525
not least, I want to remind you


1095
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,656
about our resources for


1096
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:21,416

So, we have a Branding Guide for


1098
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:26,466
podcasters.


1099
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,906
We also have the Affiliate


1100
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,045

00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,466

1102
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:33,616
might remember from the top

partner list that James


1107
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,226
mentioned; some tutorial videos


1108
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:44,096

1109
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,216
