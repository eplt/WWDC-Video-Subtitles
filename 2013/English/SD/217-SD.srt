00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:08,516
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:14,000
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:15,846
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,586
Thanks for coming out for
another UIScrollView session


5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:19,946
this year.


6
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:22,346
For those of you keeping track,


7
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:25,366
this is actually our fifth
UIScrollView session in a row.


8
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:29,346
[applause].


9
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,286
So we've talked about a lot
of great stuff over the years.


10
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:34,826
And-- So some of you
might be thinking,


11
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,636
"What could they
possibly have left to talk


12
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:39,146
about with ScrollView
this year?"


13
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,446
But, rest assured,


14
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:44,566
that ScrollViews are an
incredibly versatile class


15
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,656
and there's a lot of
stuff left to discuss


16
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:47,776
that you can do with this stuff.


17
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,866
So, if you're familiar with
the structure that viewed


18
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:53,346
in previous years, you
probably know that we're going


19
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,856
to spend some time going
pretty deep into a couple


20
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,516
of specific examples of things


21
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,866
that you can do with
ScrollViews.


22
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,176
And we're going to do that
again this year and we'll get


23
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,146
to that in just a minute.


24
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:03,856
But before we do, I want


25
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,526
to do something a little bit
different this year and kind


26
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:10,096
of take a step back and look
through iOS 7's new interfaces


27
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,576
and see how we're using
UIScrollViews in some new ways


28
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,556
that you might not necessarily
have expected we'd be using


29
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:19,536
UIScrollViews for so you
can get some different ideas


30
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:22,336
about how you can use this
kind of stuff in your own apps


31
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,056
to create some interesting
different effects.


32
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:26,666
So let's get started.


33
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:30,476
The first thing that you see
anytime you start on your phone,


34
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,846
of course, is the Lock Screen.


35
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,866
And starting in iOS 7, the
first time that you turn


36
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:39,976
on your phone, every time, the
first that you'll do is interact


37
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,006
with the UIScrollView.


38
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:44,826
So, kind of big deal.


39
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:48,726
The Lock Screen is actually now
Slide to Unlock is implemented


40
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,676
as a two-paged paging
ScrollView.


41
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,446
So when we swipe over here
to the Passcode screen,


42
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,416
we're just paging
between two pages.


43
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,716
It's easy to imagine
how that's put together.


44
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,216
Over here on the right hand
side, we've got the first page


45
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,326
and we're just swiping back
and forth between them.


46
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:07,216
Now, even before we get into
unlocking, there's more uses


47
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,485
of UIScrollView defined right
here on the Lock Screen.


48
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,426
So of course, if I get
a notification saying


49
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,946
that I have a WWDC presentation
right now in Presidio,


50
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,896
that is itself in a
vertical scrolling list


51
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,426
because you might have multiple
notifications to scroll through.


52
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:25,746
Then that's embedded within
that outer paging ScrollView.


53
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,516
It's an embedded
vertical ScrollView.


54
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,756
Now there's actually even
more because each one


55
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:34,596
of those notifications is
itself embedded inside another


56
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,096
horizontal paging ScrollView.


57
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:40,166
So you might wonder why that is
and it's actually pretty easy


58
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,776
to see once we start
interacting with it.


59
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:44,416
When you swipe on an
individual notification,


60
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,166
that will take you
directly to the application


61
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,696
that generated that
notification.


62
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:50,806
So if we start interacting
with this one,


63
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:53,536
you'll find that we can drag
it a little bit on its own,


64
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,806
but eventually it'll
catch the outer ScrollView


65
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,216
and start pulling
it along with it.


66
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,226
And then if we let
go, it just comes back


67
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,136
to rest at the beginning.


68
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,276
If we were to finish
that gesture,


69
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,046
we would be scrolling
the inner ScrollView


70
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:07,516
for a bit then we would catch
the outer one and pull both


71
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:09,276
of them over on to
the Passcode screen.


72
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,446
So this is a pretty interesting
effect being generated


73
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,396
by multiple Nested ScrollViews.


74
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,776
And this is actually the first
technique that we're going


75
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:20,146
to look at today and
go into a lot of depth


76
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,376
on how exactly that
was implemented.


77
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:25,016
So, we'll show you the
construction of the views


78
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,396
and see how we make those
ScrollViews interact to get


79
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,336
that behavior where
one pulls the other.


80
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:31,746
But before we get to
that, we're going to look


81
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:34,656
through a few more examples in
iOS 7 of this kind of thing.


82
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,756
So let's unlock the
phone and take a look


83
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,196
at some more examples
of Nesting ScrollViews.


84
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,366
So right here on the home
screen, I'm sure as you remember


85
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,036
in the past, we used
to have spotlight


86
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,116
over on the left hand page
of our paging ScrollView.


87
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:51,386
In iOS 7, it's moved up to
the top and that's implemented


88
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:54,366
as a Nested ScrollView inside
the outer paging ScrollView.


89
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:59,546
Moving into the multitasking
user interface, we can now find


90
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:03,666
that the way that we kill
applications in iOS 7-- oops.


91
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:08,466
The way that we kill running
applications in iOS7 is


92
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:11,786
by taking this interface and
scrolling it and flicking it


93
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:12,966
up off the top of the screen.


94
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:16,166
That is also now a
Nested UIScrollView.


95
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,466
Now, the interesting thing about
these Nested ScrollViews is


96
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:22,005
that we get a really
consistent experience throughout


97
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:22,916
the interface.


98
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,966
Every different place
that we see this kind


99
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,866
of interaction feels the same
way, has the same bounce,


100
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,486
has the same deceleration.


101
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:33,436
It really just makes everything
feel natural and consistent


102
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:35,196
across the entire
operating system.


103
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,696
So if you're looking at
doing any of these kinds


104
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,426
of interactions, I
would encourage you


105
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,406
to consider using a
UIScrollView to build it


106
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,436
because you'll get the
same feel that you have


107
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:45,756
across all the other
parts of iOS 7.


108
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,296
So Nesting ScrollViews,
that's a pretty common one.


109
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,616
Another thing that we found
has cropped up in a number


110
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:56,496
of different apps on iOS 7 is
multiple ScrollViews that scroll


111
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,426
through the same content
at different rates.


112
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:00,626
So again here in
the multitasking UI,


113
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,346
you can see that there are
actually two independent


114
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:04,526
sections of content.


115
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,806
Up at the top, we've got
the individual snapshot


116
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,246
of the applications and we
can scroll through those.


117
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,266
And down at the bottom,
we have their icons.


118
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,376
Now, as we scroll
through the top part,


119
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,706
we'll move fairly slowly
because we're moving


120
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,496
through those images.


121
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,886
But you'll notice that at the
bottom, the icons kind of group


122
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,166
up and now we see
more of them at once.


123
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,536
What that allows us to do
is scroll at the bottom


124
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,986
at a faster rate to get
through things more quickly.


125
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,756
So, two different
ScrollViews scrolling


126
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,826
through the same content
at different rates.


127
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:35,116
Another place where
we find that kind


128
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,646
of thing implemented is here
in the Calendar application.


129
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:40,686
So we can page through the
paging ScrollView at the bottom


130
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,476
which represents that
days of the week.


131
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:44,916
And as we do that, we
go one day at a time.


132
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,436
We can see all the days
and go nice and slow.


133
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,406
If we want to go faster,
we can scroll up at the top


134
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,606
where those numbers are,
and that would let us,


135
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:55,226
with one gesture, move
an entire week back


136
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,006
with what otherwise had taken
us seven swipes to get through.


137
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,696
So this idea of multiple
ScrollViews scrolling


138
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,106
through the same content at
different rates is showing


139
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,346
up in a number of
different places.


140
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:07,476
It might be something that you
might want to consider putting


141
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:08,526
into your own applications


142
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,266
if there's appropriate
places for that.


143
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,426
Another thing I want
to take a look


144
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:15,626
at here is some custom
content transforms


145
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,416
that are being applied
to different pieces


146
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,456
of content inside UIScrollViews.


147
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,046
So, the first one that I'd
like to take a look at is here


148
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,106
in the Clock application.


149
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:30,636
What you'll find is that there's
the 3D Transform being applied


150
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,116
to the numbers as we scroll


151
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:35,286
through on the right
hand side there.


152
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:37,746
This has always looked
vaguely 3D.


153
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:41,776
But in iOS 7, this is actually a
3D wheel being constructed using


154
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,006
3D Transforms on
[inaudible] layers.


155
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:47,426
Now, this is still the exact
same scrolling behaviors


156
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,686
that you expect across the
operating system, the same feel


157
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,156
of movement, same deceleration,


158
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,126
it's just that there's
some transforms applied


159
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,616
to the content to give an
interesting visual effect


160
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,186
that makes it unique in
this particular location.


161
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:02,706
Another example of this kind of
thing can be found in Safari.


162
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:06,176
If we go into the new Tab
Switcher interface in Safari,


163
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,446
you'll find that as you
scroll, some of the tabs


164
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,026
at the top start to pull out
of the screen towards you.


165
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,456
Now again, this is
just a UIScrollView


166
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:16,356
but we're applying Transforms
on the content while we scroll


167
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,186
to give this other interesting
visual effect that's unique


168
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,106
to this application.


169
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,366
One last place where we see this
kind of technique being used is


170
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,686
in the Passbook application.


171
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:27,416
As we scroll within passes,


172
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,826
they're bunching
up near the top.


173
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,336
And then as we pull down and
it rubber bands, they stretch


174
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,016
out from one another
a little bit.


175
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:36,106
Again, just a UIScrollView,
we have the exact same feel


176
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:39,626
of the bouncing, but we get an
interesting visual effect unique


177
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,496
to the Passbook app.


178
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:43,636
So, all of these techniques
are fairly easy to implement


179
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,296
by just applying
different Transforms


180
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:48,156
to the content while you're
scrolling in your UIScrollView.


181
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:51,616
Now the last thing I want to
take a look at before we get


182
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,616
into the specific examples
of implementing some


183
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,866
of this stuff is the
Messages application.


184
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:58,766
I'm sure you've noticed as
you'd been using Messages


185
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,876
that when you go into a
conversation and you scroll


186
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:03,756
around it, the Chat
Bubbles have a little bit


187
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:04,676
of a bounce to them.


188
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,236
It gives it this really lively
feel as you're scrolling


189
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,776
around in this application and
it's really unique compared


190
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,586
to what you see in
other apps on iOS 7.


191
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:14,196
Now this is actually the second
thing that we're going to talk


192
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,326
about today and see
exactly how this kind


193
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,356
of thing can be implemented.


194
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:20,316
It's actually become
really easy to do in iOS 7


195
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,656
with the introduction of
the new UIKit Dynamics API.


196
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,816
So, we're going to get into
that just after we talk


197
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,336
through the first
Lock Screen example.


198
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:30,306
So, let's get into building
some of these things.


199
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:33,785
And as I mentioned, the
first thing we want to talk


200
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:37,106
about is the Lock Screen,
those Nested UIScrollViews.


201
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,606
So let's take a look at that
again just for a quick reminder


202
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,076
of how this is going
to be put together.


203
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,346
So we've got here
our Lock Screen.


204
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,386
On the left side, we've
got another page of content


205
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:49,796
which is the Passcode lock.


206
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,456
And of course, this is a paging
ScrollView with two pages


207
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,906
and our content size
is represented


208
00:08:56,596 --> 00:09:00,466
by the width of those two pages.


209
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:04,026
Now, that ScrollView is actually
a full screen UIScrollView


210
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,506
because it's going
to be scrolling all


211
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,186
of the content that's
visible on the screen.


212
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,876
Nested within that, we
have the notifications.


213
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,006
And that's a much
smaller UIScrollView


214
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,706
and it scrolls only vertically,
but it's here as a child


215
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,106
of that outer paging ScrollView.


216
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,626
And then as I mentioned,


217
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,826
each one of these is also its
own nested horizontal ScrollView


218
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:23,326
and they're a little bit smaller


219
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:25,016
because they're just
scrolling the individual


220
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:26,066
notification itself.


221
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:27,786
So we've got one
here for the top


222
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:28,906
and then another for the bottom.


223
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:32,836
Now as the user starts to
move their finger on this,


224
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,136
the content in that will
get pulled over to the point


225
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,266
where it's going to catch
that outer ScrollView.


226
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,446
As they finish their
gesture and finish scrolling


227
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,106
that inner page, it pulls
the outer one along with it


228
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,876
and gets us over
onto the Lock Screen.


229
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:47,756
Now, if you've used UIScrollView
before in your apps,


230
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,176
I'm sure you're familiar
with the fact


231
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,806
that ScrollViews will not
automatically start dragging


232
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,356
their outer containing
ScrollView


233
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,226
if you just nest
one inside another.


234
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,206
So something must've
been done in order


235
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,616
to make this behavior happen.


236
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:01,046
So let's look at how
we would do that.


237
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,606
Well, where might we want to
implement this kind of thing?


238
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,016
If you've watched previous
sessions and seen some


239
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:10,496
of the techniques we've used for
implementing custom interactions


240
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:12,776
in ScrollViews, you
probably already have an idea


241
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,376
of what I'm going to say.


242
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:18,016
And that, of course, is that
there's the delegate method,


243
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,116
scrollViewDidScroll,
which allows us to find


244
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,656
out every time a ScrollView's
contentOffset changes


245
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:25,256
and do something
in response to it.


246
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:27,796
So in this case, the
thing that we want to do


247
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:30,366
in response is have the
inner ScrollView tell us


248
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:33,126
when it scrolls and then move
the outer one along with it.


249
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:35,976
So what's that going
to look like?


250
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,246
Well, we're going to implement
our scrollViewDidScroll


251
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:38,846
delegate method.


252
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,166
We're going to find out how far
the inner one has scrolled pass


253
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,686
the point where we wanted
it to catch the outer one.


254
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,536
We want to give some free
scrolling before it grabs the


255
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,046
outer one, so there's
some initial movement


256
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:51,706
that's required.


257
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,056
So let's find out how
far we got beyond that.


258
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,206
Once we have that value,
we're just going to apply it


259
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,336
as a new offset onto
the outer ScrollView.


260
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:01,206
So we'll take that
outer ScrollView


261
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:04,376
and shift its contentOffset by
the delta we just calculated.


262
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:06,596
So, actually pretty
straightforward.


263
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:09,066
And to show us exactly how
we can put that together,


264
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:11,686
Eliza is going to come up and
start doing a demo for us.


265
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:18,586
[ Applause ]


266
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:20,736
>> Hi, I'm Eliza
and I'm an engineer


267
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:21,756
on the Springboard team.


268
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:24,256
So what I've got here
is an application


269
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:25,856
that I built entirely--


270
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,826
well almost entirely
using Interface Builder.


271
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:31,826
It doesn't do very much yet,
but it illustrates the hierarchy


272
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,676
of ScrollViews that
Josh already described.


273
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:37,036
So we have an outer paging
ScrollView that scrolls


274
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:40,226
between this list of
colors and the building.


275
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:42,176
I'm reusing the building
views that I wrote


276
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:43,536
for our session two years ago.


277
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,866
So, we can scroll back and
forth between those pages.


278
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:52,046
Now, the first page of this
two-paged paging ScrollView


279
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:55,196
contains a vertically
scrolling collection view.


280
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:58,286
And then each individual cell


281
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,566
in the collection view contains
a horizontally scrolling


282
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:04,286
ScrollView that scrolls
the color for that cell


283
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,506
on and off the screen.


284
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:09,146
So, this is set up with
remarkably little code.


285
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,126
And what I want to do
now is to jump straight


286
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:15,056
to showing you how we can add
the behavior that we're getting


287
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,946
in the Lock Screen where
as you start scrolling one


288
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,806
of these cells, it scrolls a
little of the way over, catches,


289
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,116
and then pulls the outer
paging ScrollView with it.


290
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:26,666
So, of course, this isn't
happening by itself.


291
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,856
And in order to do this,
we're going to need


292
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:33,766
to make a mechanism that the
inner ScrollViews can use


293
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,256
to communicate with the View
Controller that's managing the


294
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,406
outer paging ScrollView.


295
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,666
And the way that I'm going to
do that is a delegate protocol.


296
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,286
So here in my scrolling
cell, which is a subclass


297
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,626
of UICollectionView cell,


298
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:51,626
I'm going to add a scrolling
cell delegate protocol


299
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,646
that our View Controller
is going to conform to so


300
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:58,896
that it can find out when
the inner cell has started


301
00:12:58,896 --> 00:12:59,396ddle
to scroll.


302
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:02,836
So, we're going to need a
couple of methods in here.


303
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:04,866
We're going to need
a ScrollView--


304
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,696
scrolling cell did begin
pulling, so that's going


305
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:10,196
to get called when you
get your finger passed


306
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:13,306
to that catch point and start
pulling the outer guy with you.


307
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:17,486
We need to find out
at every frame


308
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:20,356
of scrolling how much
the pull offset changed.


309
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,696
So every time that the
pull offset changes,


310
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,566
the second method
will get invoked.


311
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,726
And finally, we need to be
able to tell our delegate


312
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:31,186
when the scrolling
cell stops pulling


313
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,986
so that the delegate
can clean up any state


314
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,406
that it might have put


315
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:37,036
into effect once the
scrolling started.


316
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,556
OK, so we've got this
delegate protocol.


317
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,066
We need to make it possible
for a delegate to be set


318
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:47,646
on our scrolling cell and then
in order to make Xcode happy,


319
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,046
we need to pre-declare
our scrolling cell


320
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:50,816
delegate protocol.


321
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:55,556
OK, so now that we've-- I've
described what we're going


322
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,176
to build, before I
go and show you how


323
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,466
to implement this scrolling
cell side of things,


324
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,626
I'm going to head over
to the View Controller


325
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,476
that is managing the
outer paging ScrollView


326
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:09,936
and show how we can actually
adopt this delegate protocol


327
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,176
because that's actually going to
turn out to be very little code.


328
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,366
So this is my View
Controller class.


329
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:16,826
Pretty much, all it does


330
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,956
so far is be a UICollectionView
data source


331
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,106
and return these
scrolling cells.


332
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:27,866
So, we need to make this
View Controller conform


333
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,696
to the scrolling cell
delegate protocol.


334
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:33,946
When we make a scrolling cell,


335
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,576
we need to set its
delegate to our self.


336
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:40,516
I'm going to just adjust the
number of cells here to make it


337
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,816
so we've got more
to scroll through.


338
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,206
All right, now we
need to go ahead


339
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:48,436
and implement these
three delegate methods.


340
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:53,486
What we're going to do is
when we find out that one


341
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,066
of our little scrolling
cells started pulling,


342
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:59,286
we're going to programmatically
adjust the contentOffset


343
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,156
of the outer paging ScrollView.


344
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,276
And because we're going to--


345
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,806
we're basically giving the
inner ScrollView control


346
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,746
over the outer ScrollView's
contentOffset,


347
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:12,106
it turns out to be sort of
awkward if we also continue


348
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,866
to allow the user to interact


349
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,596
with the paging ScrollView
while that's happening.


350
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,036
So when the scrolling cell
begins pulling, what I'm going


351
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:22,126
to do is I'm going to tell
the outer ScrollView not


352
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,646
to allow user scrolling.


353
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,796
And then when the
scrolling cell stops pulling,


354
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,556
I'm going to re-enable
user scrolling


355
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:29,366
on the outer ScrollView.


356
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,476
When the scrolling cell
changes its pull offset then,


357
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:34,406
I'm simply going


358
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:36,556
to programmatically
set the contentOffset


359
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,216
of my outer ScrollView
to the correct--


360
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:42,636
well, to the offset
that was reported to me.


361
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,986
And then just to make it
just a little bit more fun,


362
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,256
when we start pulling
one of the colors over,


363
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,816
let's have the building
change its color.


364
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,896
So we'll draw a new building
with the color of the cell.


365
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,566
All right.


366
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:56,536
So that's pretty much
all we need here.


367
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:57,846
So I'm going to switch back


368
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,266
to the scrolling
cell implementation


369
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,866
and we can see how to go
about calling these methods


370
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,376
to cause the scrolling
to take place.


371
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:11,476
So the first thing we need to
decide is how far are you going


372
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:13,226
to get in your scrolling of one


373
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:16,216
of these inner ScrollViews
before you start pulling the


374
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,686
outer ScrollView with you.


375
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:21,376
And I'm going to do that
by simply defining a


376
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:22,086
pull threshold.


377
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,216
I've chosen 60, but
obviously any number


378
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,606
within reason would work.


379
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:29,466
We're also going to need to
keep track of some state,


380
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,676
are we currently pulling
the outer ScrollView


381
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,656
because we're going to-- we
need to tell the delegate


382
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:36,256
when this starts and stops.


383
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:39,586
So with that in place,
we can then go ahead


384
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,646
and implement the
UIScrollView delegate protocol.


385
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,906
And in particular, we're going


386
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:47,776
to use the scrollViewDidScroll
method to find out every time


387
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:50,086
that our inner ScrollView's
contentOffset changes.


388
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,966
So, we can get the current
contentOffset which is,


389
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,266
since we only care about the
horizontal direction here,


390
00:16:56,476 --> 00:17:01,176
it's just the ScrollView's
contentOffset.x. Now let's


391
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:04,986
figure out whether this offset
represents the beginning


392
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:05,756
of pulling.


393
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:07,736
So did we just start pulling?


394
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,726
We just started pulling
if the offset got bigger


395
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:13,596
than the pull threshold and
we weren't already pulling.


396
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:16,986
And if that's the case, then
we can tell our delegate


397
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:19,195
that the ScrollView-- the
scrolling cell began pulling


398
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,786
and we can set our flag to Yes.


399
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:23,705
All right.


400
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,756
So if we are pulling,


401
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:28,606
we now need to tell the
delegate an additional thing.


402
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:31,866
We need to tell the delegate how
much we changed the pull offset.


403
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,866
So, we'll calculate what
the new pull offset is


404
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:38,866
by subtracting the
pull threshold


405
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,976
from our current
internal offset.


406
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,316
And what I've written here
is actually not quite right.


407
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,196
So imagine the following
scenario.


408
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:49,446
I start scrolling in this
inner cell, I get passed


409
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,556
to the pull threshold
so I'd start pulling,


410
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,916
and then I move my finger
back and forth a little bit,


411
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,586
and I get under and
then over and then


412
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,036
under the pull threshold.


413
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,276
We don't want to
report a negative number


414
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,406
to our outer paging ScrollView.


415
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,356
That would have some
weird effect.


416
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:06,076
So what we want to do
instead is make sure


417
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,376
that we always report
a minimum of zero.


418
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,406
So, we're going to take the
maximum of zero and the offset


419
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:15,016
that we just calculated.


420
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:17,516
And then we can tell
the delegate


421
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,026
that the scrolling cell changed
the pull offset to that amount.


422
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,566
The last thing that we
need to do is to figure


423
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:26,276
out when the pulling stops.


424
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,456
And what I've decided to
do here is just decide is


425
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,926
that the pulling is going to
stop when the scrolling stops.


426
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,176
So, we need to figure out
when the scrolling ends.


427
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:39,076
And if it-- when it ends,
we can tell our delegate


428
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,596
that the scrolling
cell stopped pulling


429
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:44,926
and we can set our
flag back to No.


430
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:45,956
All right, how are
we going to figure


431
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:47,196
out that the scrolling ended?


432
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:48,636
If you've seen any
of our sessions,


433
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:50,256
I feel like I write
this code every year.


434
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,216
There's two different ways that
scrolling can come to stop.


435
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:56,226
One is that you're
scrolling, you have no momentum


436
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,066
and you lift your finger,


437
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,006
and then the scrolling
ends right then and there.


438
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:02,046
Alternatively, you
may have some momentum


439
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,466
when you lift your
finger, at which point,


440
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,276
there's a deceleration
period first.


441
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:08,056
So we need to catch both of
those cases and we can do


442
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:11,856
that with two further
delegate methods,


443
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:14,546
scrolling cell
scrollViewDidEndDragging


444
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:15,286
:willDecelerate.


445
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,946
And if we're not decelerating,


446
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:18,616
then that means the
scrolling ended.


447
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,116
Otherwise, we're going to
catch the scrolling ended


448
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,906
when the deceleration ends.


449
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,256
All right, so with
all of that in place,


450
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,606
I'm going to go head
and run this.


451
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:30,996
We have more cells,
which is nice,


452
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,066
which we can scroll through.


453
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:38,306
OK, so now if I grab one,
it scrolls, it catches,


454
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:42,116
and it starts pulling the
outer ScrollView with us


455
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,376
which is exactly what we wanted


456
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:46,356
and we can get over
to the building.


457
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,246
So now, there's a couple
of bugs here that I want


458
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:49,996
to draw your attention


459
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:53,326
to if your attention has not
already been drawn to them.


460
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,016
One is that we obviously
didn't get far enough over,


461
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:58,546
so we're sort of stuck on
a weird page that's like in


462
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:02,246
between page boundaries with our
building view not all the way


463
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:02,926
in the picture.


464
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,086
Another problem is that
our cell is missing,


465
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,076
the one that we just
scrolled over is gone.


466
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,946
And then another problem which
is a little bit less obvious,


467
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,696
although maybe it was obvious.


468
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,586
Here, my finger is
where the arrow is


469
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,996
and I start dragging
and I catch.


470
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:22,526
And now, I would expect that
green cell to stay pinned


471
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:24,986
under my finger as it
drags the stuff with,


472
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,316
but that's not what happens.


473
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:30,926
Instead, it zooms out from under
my finger and then disappears.


474
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,106
So I'm going to, in a minute,
turn things back over to Josh


475
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:35,976
to explain two of
these problems.


476
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:39,086
But the problem where
the cells are just gone,


477
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,606
that's actually really
easy to fix, so I'm going


478
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:42,736
to just fix that right now.


479
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,946
That's happening because
we're scrolling the content


480
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,686
of those cells off the screen


481
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,156
when we pull the
outer ScrollView over.


482
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,986
So we can fix that
by simply, you know,


483
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:57,246
our scrolling ended method here
just setting the contentOffset


484
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,476
of our ScrollView back to zero.


485
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,986
But now for the other two
bugs, the zooming out from


486
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,346
under your finger
bug and the fact


487
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,596
that we're not getting all the
way over to the building page,


488
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,376
I'm going to send it
back over to Josh.


489
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,786
[ Applause ]


490
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,276
>> All right, thanks Eliza.


491
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:15,976
So, we're getting pretty close.


492
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,206
It's almost there.


493
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,746
Just a couple of
bugs to take care of,


494
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,736
nothing we can't handle.


495
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:25,006
So, let's take a look at how
we ended up with only part


496
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:26,616
of that page visible first.


497
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,326
Now, we have two pages
worth of content.


498
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:32,296
So that gives us a content
size represented here


499
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:35,936
by this yellow square,
it's about two pages.


500
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:38,346
And we've defined the size


501
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:41,316
of our inner ScrollView's
content to be equal to that.


502
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,946
So we've got that nested
inner paging ScrollView


503
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,956
and it's also got
two pages of content.


504
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:48,256
That's how we're going to
cause it to get pulled.


505
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:51,886
So let's see what's going wrong
as our user starts to drag here.


506
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:55,526
We start pulling that inner
ScrollView a little bit


507
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,816
and it moves over to the right.


508
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,986
But now you'll notice that
the sizes of our content


509
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,756
which started out aligned on
the left have now pulled away


510
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,216
from each other 'cause the
inner one has moved a bit


511
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,806
but the outer one
hasn't started yet.


512
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,066
So now, if we let the
user finish the gesture


513
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,916
on that inner ScrollView, it's
going to finish paging over


514
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,946
and come to rest, and it will
hit its end before the full


515
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:19,016
content size of the outer
ScrollView has been pulled


516
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:19,566
into view.


517
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,916
So it's really the case that
that inner ScrollView needs


518
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,716
to scroll farther than the outer
ScrollView because it's going


519
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,096
to move a little bit by
itself before it catches


520
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:30,796
and starts pulling
the outer one with it.


521
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,986
So how do we make the inner
ScrollView scroll more?


522
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,806
Well, as you know, the way


523
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:38,886
that a UIScrollView's
content size is defined is


524
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:42,636
by its bounce-- I'm
sorry, of the paging


525
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,006
with is defined by its bounce.


526
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,936
And in this case,
we need two pages


527
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,286
of content 'cause we have a
two-paged paging ScrollView.


528
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:52,536
So we need a larger bounce in
order to get a larger page size


529
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:54,446
so we have more content
to scroll.


530
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,366
So, if we look at the bounce
of our ScrollView right,


531
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,136
it's the exact same width
as it its containers.


532
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,646
So that gives it
the same page size.


533
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,466
To get a bigger page size,
we have to make it wider.


534
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:05,846
Now, let's find here.


535
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,856
We can let it hang off the
right side of the screen


536
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:10,116
because it's not drawing
anything over there.


537
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,816
We're just making it bigger so
that it can scroll more content.


538
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:15,656
And then you'll notice that
we are still using two pages,


539
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:18,066
so we've doubled our content
size and that causes it


540
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,396
to hang off on the left as well.


541
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,236
So let's see what happens
if we start scrolling


542
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,256
with that configuration.


543
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,826
Now, we start pulling that
inner one in a little bit.


544
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,526
And at the point where it's
going to catch, the left sides


545
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:32,196
of our content size of both
ScrollViews are now aligned.


546
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:33,626
Now, that seems a lot better


547
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:35,936
because if we let our
ScrollView finish pulling,


548
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,496
it's going to pull
that outer one with it,


549
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,966
and they'll both come to
rest when they have all


550
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:41,236
of their content fully visible.


551
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,776
So just making that
ScrollView a little wider


552
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:47,376
to give us a wider page
and more room to move


553
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,906
on the inner ScrollView,
fixes that first problem.


554
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,736
But now something else is
still wrong because we had


555
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:56,036
that second problem that Eliza
showed you where we ended


556
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,896
up having the content shooting
out from under her finger


557
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,776
as she was scrolling
the inner ScrollView.


558
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,956
So, why was that happening?


559
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,596
Well, to understand
what was going there,


560
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:08,136
it helps a little bit more
to look again at the frame


561
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,676
and bounce of the
inner ScrollView.


562
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,436
So here, we have
it visible right


563
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,396
in the middle of our screen.


564
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,826
Let's take a look step by
step at what's going on again.


565
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,566
We start pulling a little
bit with our finger.


566
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,126
We get to the point where
we're going to catch.


567
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,306
Now if we hadn't anything else,
if we weren't doing the bit


568
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,796
where we're pulling
the outer ScrollView,


569
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:27,956
what would've just
happened is we'd keep moving


570
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,476
that inner ScrollView's
content along.


571
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:32,846
But of course, what we are doing
then is calling setContentOffset


572
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,736
on the outer one to
cause to move with it.


573
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:37,656
So what we think that should be
doing is pulling the ScrollView


574
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:38,046
with it.


575
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:41,046
Unfortunately, what we
forgot about here is


576
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,486
that that inner ScrollView
is actually a subview


577
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:44,606
of the outer ScrollView.


578
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,126
So not only does the
outer ScrollView move,


579
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,626
but it also ends up
pulling the inner one along


580
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,046
because it's a child of it.


581
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,376
So, we're-- the inner
ScrollView is getting scrolled


582
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:56,416
by its own gesture recognizer
and then as a result of that,


583
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,546
it's telling the
outer ScrollView


584
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,896
to move which moves it again.


585
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,546
And the really bad part here is


586
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:04,496
that the red area representing
our frame is now moving


587
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:05,156
off screen.


588
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:07,776
So, the ScrollView
is actually moving


589
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:08,786
out from under our finger.


590
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,966
And this is causing the
double scrolling Eliza saw


591
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,986
which is pulling all
the content too fast.


592
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:16,586
So we really want to
pull that ScrollView back


593
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,026
so the left sides of the
content remain aligned


594
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,696
and the ScrollView,
the inner one,


595
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,366
remains centered on the screen.


596
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:25,036
Now this is actually very
similar to a technique


597
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:29,276
that we should a couple of years
ago in 2011 for pinning views


598
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:31,736
in place while you're
scrolling a ScrollView.


599
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,816
This is the same kind
of technique that's used


600
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:36,166
in UITableView, when
you scroll vertically,


601
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,086
you get a table header and it
pins to the top of the screen


602
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:40,476
as content scrolls under it.


603
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:42,576
We want to do the same
kind of thing here.


604
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:45,026
We want to pin that inner
ScrollView to the left side


605
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:46,496
of the screen so it stays


606
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,666
in place even though its
parent is moving under it.


607
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,836
That way, when the user moves
their finger more and lifts,


608
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:55,036
this outer ScrollView will
come to restfully on screen


609
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,906
and the inner one which is the
child of it will still remain


610
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,236
in place on screen and
everything will work right.


611
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:02,736
So what's that going to
look like in our code


612
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:03,486
that we already wrote?


613
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,096
Well, it's actually just
a really small change


614
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,576
to what we've already got, just
one little thing that we have


615
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:09,516
to add at the end here.


616
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,486
And that's that we need
to translate the child


617
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:14,806
by the same amount that
we're pulling the parent.


618
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:17,666
So we want to undo that
movement that we're adding.


619
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,296
We're going to pull
the parent some amount


620
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,336
and then translate the child
back by the same amount


621
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,526
so it doesn't double pull.


622
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:24,866
So Eliza's going to come
back now and fix our demo


623
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:25,996
so that this all works.


624
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:33,146
[ Applause ]


625
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:36,366
>> OK. So, we have
two problems to fix.


626
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,536
The first one, if you recall,


627
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:39,936
was that our page wasn't getting
all the way scrolled over,


628
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,536
so I'm going to address
that one first.


629
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,756
We need to go down to the bottom
of this file here in a part


630
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:47,176
that I didn't show before
which is where we're laying


631
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:52,326
out the subviews of our inner--
internal to the cell ScrollView.


632
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:56,076
So you'll see that I had
calculated a page width


633
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,306
to be the size of
my cell's bounce


634
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:02,046
that was causing the problem,
wasn't wide enough given


635
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,996
that we have this pull
threshold to contend with.


636
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:09,046
So, what I'm going to simply
do is add the pull threshold


637
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,366
to the page width.


638
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:15,506
And then because I've
actually determined the frame


639
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:17,956
and the content size of
the ScrollView in terms


640
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,506
of the page width, everything
should then just work


641
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,196
from that point.


642
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:26,916
So now to address the issue
of the shooting out from


643
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:30,756
under your finger problem
and just scroll back up here


644
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,696
to my scrollViewDidscroll
method.


645
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:37,166
When we tell the delegate
that our pull offset changed,


646
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,566
the delegate is going
to turn around


647
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:40,116
and change the contentOffset


648
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,476
of the outer ScrollView
which contains us.


649
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:48,076
And so, that's causing us to get
pulled along with it resulting


650
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:49,696
in the double scrolling.


651
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:52,666
So what we'll do to
counteract that is


652
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,056
to simply set a Transform on
the ScrollView which is one


653
00:27:56,056 --> 00:28:01,446
of our subviews and we'll set
a Transform which simply uses


654
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,626
that very same pull offset


655
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:06,176
so that the ScrollView scrolls
along with the outer ScrollView


656
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:10,606
and as a result, sort of
surprisingly, it actually seems


657
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,296
to remain in the same
place on the screen.


658
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,226
This is a technique that
we, as just Josh mentioned,


659
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,926
talked about in 2011 with
getting a moon to stay fixed


660
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:19,706
on the screen when
you're scrolling a bunch


661
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:22,446
of buildings out from under it.


662
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:27,406
So, when we finished
scrolling here


663
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,536
and set our contentOffset
back to zero,


664
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:31,756
let's also set the
Transform back to Identity


665
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:34,946
so that we don't end up in a
weird transformed state while


666
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,116
we're not doing any scrolling.


667
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:42,036
OK. So with that in place,
I'm going to build again.


668
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:45,296
And I can grab one of
these cells, it catches


669
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,216
and it stays fixed
as we want it.


670
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,596
And it gets all the way over
to the building this time.


671
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,426
So this looks like it's
working pretty well.


672
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,366
It's doing pretty
much what we want.


673
00:28:56,226 --> 00:28:58,666
And notice that the buildings
change color as planned.


674
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:04,736
So, there's one bug here that
may not be immediately obvious


675
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:05,626
and I'm going to do something


676
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,466
to make it a little
bit more obvious.


677
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,576
I'm going to change
the pull threshold


678
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:14,476
to a larger number
and run it again.


679
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,956
So if I scroll this cell over,


680
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:18,886
now I can get it a little
further before it catches


681
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,326
and then I let go.


682
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,946
Watch really carefully, when
I let go so that this going


683
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:25,206
to return back to
the zero position,


684
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:28,806
you'll see that the outer
paging ScrollView kind


685
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,006
of slams into place.


686
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:33,246
The inner ScrollView comes
to a nice decelerated rest


687
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:35,546
as you'd expect from
a ScrollView.


688
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:39,456
But the outer ScrollView,
it's pretty abrupt that way


689
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,676
that it hits the
edge of the screen.


690
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:45,106
So, this is actually
kind of what you'd expect


691
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:46,736
to happen given the way
that this is implemented.


692
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:50,826
When I move this back and forth,
you can see that the inner


693
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:53,426
and the outer ScrollViews are
moving at exactly the same rate.


694
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:57,166
They're sort of pinned together
with 120 points difference.


695
00:29:57,686 --> 00:30:00,686
So when this starts
moving back, of course,


696
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,036
while the inner ScrollView
is still decelerating,


697
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,266
the outer ScrollView
is going to hit zero


698
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,456
and then the inner
ScrollView continues.


699
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:12,136
What would be nice would be
is if we're in this condition


700
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:13,726
where we're scrolling
back to zero,


701
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,676
if we could change
the rate of scrolling


702
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:18,386
of the outer ScrollView so that
both ScrollViews would come


703
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,336
to rest at the same time.


704
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,116
And I'm going to show
you how to do that.


705
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:24,666
It's a technique similar to
the techniques that we're using


706
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,036
in other places in iOS 7


707
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:28,626
to get these two ScrollViews
moving at different rates.


708
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:33,996
So the first thing that we need
to do to accomplish this is


709
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:37,596
to keep track of whether we're
in this decelerating back


710
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,366
to zero condition,
'cause we're going


711
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:41,526
to do something special
in that case.


712
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:44,346
What we're going to do in
that case is move the outer


713
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,866
ScrollView at-- with--


714
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,586
at a fraction of the speed
of the inner ScrollView.


715
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,176
So we need to figure out
what that fraction should be.


716
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,086
And I'm going to do that by
storing off a deceleration


717
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:54,986
distance ratio.


718
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:58,706
We want the ratio of how
far the outer ScrollView has


719
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:01,536
to move compared to how far the
inner ScrollView has to move,


720
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,486
and then we're going to
slow down the scrolling


721
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,666
of the outer ScrollView
by that proportion.


722
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:09,676
OK, so how can we detect that
we're decelerating back to zero?


723
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:14,796
We can do this by implementing
an additional ScrollView


724
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:17,726
delegate method,
scrollView WillEndDragging:


725
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,746
withVelocity:target
ContentOffset.


726
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:23,256
So, you may have seen
this method in the past.


727
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,216
It's often used to change the
landing position of a ScrollView


728
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:28,336
when it starts decelerating.


729
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:31,286
We're going to use it not for
that purpose but simply to find


730
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:32,776
out what the landing
position is.


731
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:35,476
Because if the landing
position is zero,


732
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,156
so if the target
contentOffset is zero


733
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:40,436
and our current contentOffset
isn't already zero,


734
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,146
it means that we're about to
start decelerating back to zero


735
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,226
which is what we
wanted to find out.


736
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,756
So, we'll grab our
current offset.


737
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:53,526
And then if the target
contentOffset.x is zero


738
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,526
but my current offset
is greater than zero,


739
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:58,906
that means that I am indeed
now decelerating back to zero.


740
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:03,406
And then, of course,
when the scrolling ends,


741
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:05,176
I just need to remember
to clear that flag.


742
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:06,366
We're not decelerating back


743
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,786
to zero once we've
stopped scrolling.


744
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:11,826
OK, so now, if we are
decelerating back to zero,


745
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:14,786
we need to figure out the
ratio of the distances


746
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:17,006
that are going to
be scrolled here.


747
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,496
So we already have
our own offset.


748
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:24,096
We can calculate the outer
offset which is the pull offset,


749
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,366
the same way that
we did it above.


750
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:29,966
And then our deceleration
distance ratio is simply the


751
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:33,176
pull offset divided by the
inner ScrollView's offset.


752
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:40,316
So now we can use that
up here in this code here


753
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:42,846
where we were calculating what
to report to the delegate.


754
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:46,676
So we were reporting that the
delegate's pull offset should


755
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:49,306
always be basically
moving together with ours.


756
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:53,516
But instead, we're going to do
something different in the case


757
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,096
where we're decelerating
back to zero.


758
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:59,896
So first of all, if we are
not decelerating back to zero,


759
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:03,036
we're going to do the
same thing we did before.


760
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:07,066
But if we are decelerating back
to zero, we're instead going


761
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:10,376
to choose a pull offset
which is our own offset times


762
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:11,666
that ratio that we calculated.


763
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:14,026
And that's going to cause
the outer paging ScrollView


764
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:16,916
to move more slowly when we're


765
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,776
in this decelerating
back to zero condition.


766
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:22,806
So I'm going to go
ahead and run it again.


767
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:27,856
And you can now see that if I
let go of this and let it return


768
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:31,996
to zero, they come in
for landing together.


769
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:34,546
So that's another technique
that's maybe useful.


770
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,076
And I'm going to turn
it back over to Josh


771
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:37,086
to talk about another topic.


772
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:44,076
[ Applause ]


773
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:46,416
>> OK, so that's
topic number one.


774
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,456
Now, as I mentioned, we
also want to take a look


775
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:52,146
at how we built the
Messages Interface


776
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,016
with those really
interesting bouncy bubbles


777
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,856
as you're scrolling
through conversations.


778
00:33:57,606 --> 00:34:00,276
Now, this is actually a
really, really cool stuff.


779
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:01,666
And if you didn't have a chance


780
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,996
to watch the earlier UIKit
Dynamics talk this week,


781
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:07,236
I would strongly encourage
you to go check that out.


782
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,565
There's some very
cool stuff there.


783
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:13,106
This is not actually a UI
Dynamics session, so we're going


784
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,136
to go over a bit of stuff
here and give you an idea


785
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,016
of how you can use it
in this configuration,


786
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:19,485
but we're not going to go
into a huge amount of depth


787
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:20,866
on that particular API.


788
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,565
Similarly, we're going
to use a UICollectionView


789
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,386
in this demo here.


790
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,886
And if you haven't used
UICollectionView before,


791
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,596
there was a great
talk last year in 2012


792
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:32,896
about how UICollectionView
can be used,


793
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:34,636
and I'd encourage
you to go watch that.


794
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:36,886
We're going to talk about
some of the high level details


795
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:39,005
of how you use it here,
but we're not going to go


796
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:40,005
into a lot of depth again.


797
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,436
So the really interesting
thing that we're going


798
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:45,335
to show is the interesting
marriage of those two APIs,


799
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,416
CollectionView and UIDynamics,


800
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:50,016
and we'll see how they fit
together to make this kind


801
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,856
of interface really,
really easy to build.


802
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,096
So, let's take a look at what
it is that we want to build.


803
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,796
Some beautiful great squares.


804
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:59,606
But the interesting
thing about them is


805
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,866
that when our user scrolls them,


806
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,136
we're going to have them
get this really nice


807
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:03,986
bouncing effect.


808
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:07,106
I've exaggerated it here so
it's more visible than it is


809
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,266
in the Messages application.


810
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,486
You might want to tone it down
a little bit so that you don't,


811
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,496
you know, cause your
users to go too crazy.


812
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:16,736
But we want to build something
that looks just like that.


813
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:19,056
Now, if we didn't do anything,
of course, what would happen


814
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,756
as we scroll this
kind of content is


815
00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:22,786
that everything would
just move, stuck together,


816
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,306
and it feel pretty static.


817
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,636
It's, you know, it's the kind
of scrolling you expect to see.


818
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,526
But it's not quite
as interesting


819
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,366
as what we're going for.


820
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:33,136
So what do we have to change
in order to make it go


821
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:35,126
from that to the bounciness?


822
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:38,056
We have to have kind
of a conceptual shift


823
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:39,066
in what we're trying to do.


824
00:35:39,526 --> 00:35:43,656
So by default, UIScrollViews
scroll its content area and all


825
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:46,156
of its children just move
along with it directly pinned


826
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,406
under the finger, moving
with the ScrollView.


827
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:52,306
Instead, we want to
behave as if each


828
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:55,886
of these individual cells
is pinned to the super view,


829
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:58,196
pinned to that ScrollView
at their center point.


830
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:01,476
And when we scroll,
we actually want


831
00:36:01,476 --> 00:36:04,486
to move the attachment points
instead of the views themselves.


832
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:07,826
We want the individual child
elements to remain in place


833
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:11,296
and resist scrolling and just
move their attachment points.


834
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:14,026
Then we can attach
the individual cells


835
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:16,326
to their attachment
points with springs


836
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:19,006
and let the dynamic
system pull them along


837
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:20,186
and bounce into place.


838
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,316
So how are we going to do that?


839
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,806
Well, you know, you
just heard me say,


840
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:28,846
the scrollViewDidScroll delegate
method for the last sample,


841
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,376
we talked about that
a lot in recent years,


842
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,406
so you wouldn't be too surprised
if I were to say that now.


843
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:36,816
But in this case, we're going


844
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:37,796
to do something a
little bit different.


845
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:41,986
We're going to go ahead and use
a UICollectionViewFlowLayout.


846
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:46,316
A UICollectionViewFlowLayout
is the object that you use


847
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:49,476
to represent locations
of things on the screen


848
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,766
within a UICollectionView.


849
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,326
So this is the point where
if you're not really familiar


850
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:55,566
with UICollectionView,
I strongly encourage you


851
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:56,726
to read a little
bit more about it.


852
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,646
We're going to talk about
the details that you need


853
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,786
to understand in order
to build this UI,


854
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,536
but there's a lot
more depth here


855
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,586
that lets you do even
more powerful things


856
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:07,146
if you go a little bit further.


857
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:09,656
So once we've got our
UICollectionViewFlowLayout


858
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,846
subclass, we're going
to do a few things in it


859
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:14,096
to tie it together with
the UIDynamic systems.


860
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,036
So we're going to create
a UIDynamicAnimator


861
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,626
which is the main entry
point to UIKit Dynamics.


862
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,146
This is the thing that
represents the physics world


863
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,016
and lets us build
up the interface


864
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,546
to actually get those
bouncing effects.


865
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:28,896
Now, to create the attachments,


866
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,286
the springs that
we talked about,


867
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:34,376
we're going to create UIDynamic
behaviors, one for each item


868
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:35,326
in our collection view.


869
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:37,236
Now a UIDynamic--


870
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:40,646
UIAttachmentBehavior is a
particular type of behavior


871
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:42,776
that represents a spring,
and it's going to give us


872
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:44,336
that bouncing effect
that we're looking for.


873
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:47,226
So then, the only other thing
left to do in order to complete


874
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:50,166
that interface will be to
actually stretch those springs


875
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,706
out as the user scrolls.


876
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,936
And we'll do that by
stretching them out, obviously.


877
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:58,066
Now, as I mentioned, we're going


878
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:00,536
to create this
CollectionViewLayout subclass,


879
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,096
so let's see what
that looks like.


880
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:05,156
And now there's three methods
that we have to implement.


881
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:08,166
We've got the prepareLayout
method,


882
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:11,016
and prepareLayout is called
by the collection view


883
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:13,766
to get your CollectionViewLayout
subclass ready


884
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,196
to display things on screen.


885
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,986
So in order to figure
out what to display


886
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:20,246
at particular locations,


887
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:23,326
you create these objects
called UICollectionView


888
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,336
LayoutAttributes.


889
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,186
A UICollectionView
LayoutAttributes object


890
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:28,996
represents the position
of an item


891
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,666
in the collection
view on the screen.


892
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,266
Now we're going to take
advantage of the fact


893
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,666
that we're a subclass of
UICollectionViewFlowLayout


894
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,426
to create these objects for us.


895
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,906
Our super class to, the flow
layout, already knows how


896
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,156
to do layout of the thing--


897
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:43,206
of things in a particular
grid-like structure,


898
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:45,366
so we can just call
through the super class


899
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,886
to get the initial positions
so we don't have to do any


900
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:50,126
of the math to do the
initial layout calculations.


901
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:52,486
That's really the benefit
of being a subclass


902
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:53,466
of the flow layout here.


903
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,106
It's going to save
us a lot of code


904
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:56,746
for doing the initial
location setup.


905
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,026
Then once we've got that,


906
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,806
we're going to create a
UIDynamicAnimator which is going


907
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,596
to represent that physics world


908
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,966
and create all the
UIAttachmentBehaviors.


909
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,486
We're going to create
one UIAttachmentBehavior


910
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:11,026
for each UICollectionView
LayoutAttributes object


911
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:14,116
that we have because the layout
attributes object represents the


912
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,966
element on screen, its position,


913
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:19,476
and the attachment behavior
represents the spring attaching


914
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:21,386
it to its attachment
point in the ScrollView.


915
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:24,246
So we want one for
each paired together.


916
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:27,286
Now these other two methods
that we have here are going


917
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:28,766
to be really, really easy.


918
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:31,536
And so easy that I'm going to
write the code on the slide here


919
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:33,226
because it's just that simple.


920
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:35,076
A UIDynamicAnimator


921
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:36,996
and UICollectionViewFlowLayout
are designed


922
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:38,206
to work really well together.


923
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:41,226
So in this case, we've got
items for Rect as a method


924
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:44,106
on UIDynamicAnimator which
is exactly what we need


925
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:45,606
to answer the collection
view question,


926
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:47,416
layoutAttributes
ForElementInRect,


927
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,476
so we can just pass the
result directly back.


928
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:53,956
Additionally, we've got
this layoutAttributes


929
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:57,716
ForCellAtIndexPath, and
we can return the result


930
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,816
of that directly for this
other CollectionViewLayout


931
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,626
subclass method.


932
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:02,586
So with those two
things implemented,


933
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,586
that will give us
everything we need in order


934
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,796
to represent our
CollectionViewLayout


935
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,126
with the bouncing effects.


936
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:10,786
So then the last
bit to represent all


937
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,846
of this is stretching
the springs.


938
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,466
So how do we do that?


939
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:18,296
Well, as I mentioned, we've got
the scrollViewDidScroll delegate


940
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,256
method that we usually
use for this kind of thing


941
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,226
but we're not going to
do that this time around.


942
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,826
And to understand why, it helps


943
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:27,726
to remember a particular
property of UIScrollViews


944
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,996
and that is that the
ScrollView's contentOffset is


945
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,496
equal to its bounds.origin.


946
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,206
Those two are the same thing.


947
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,826
Now the reason that
that is important


948
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:38,606
in this particular example is


949
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:41,226
because there's actually a
method on UICollectionViewLayout


950
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:42,296
that we can take advantage


951
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:44,946
of to get the information
we're looking


952
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:47,356
for in the CollectionViewLayout
subclass itself.


953
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:49,446
And the reason we want
to do that instead


954
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,186
of using the delegate method is


955
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,996
because we're writing all
these codes in a subclass


956
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:55,546
of UICollectionViewFlowLayout,


957
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:59,756
but the flow layout is this
layout object that exists


958
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:03,086
to help a collection view
display content on screen.


959
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:06,166
scrollViewDidScroll is a
scrollView delegate method.


960
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,586
The CollectionViewLayout
is almost certainly not the


961
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:09,436
ScrollView delegate.


962
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:11,466
So if we were to try
and use that method,


963
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:13,036
we'd have to create
a tight coupling


964
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:15,826
between the collection view
and the CollectionViewLayout


965
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,876
by passing that information
about scrolling through


966
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:21,596
and it would create
just too much structure


967
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,936
when we really want to
keep those thing separated.


968
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:26,846
So instead, we can
advantage of this method.


969
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:29,706
It's called shouldInvalidate
LayoutForBoundsChange.


970
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:32,986
Now, the nice thing here is that
we're passed in the new bounds


971
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:33,996
that we're changing too


972
00:41:34,336 --> 00:41:36,646
and since the bounds.origin
is the contentOffset,


973
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:38,896
we've got our new
contentOffset right there.


974
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,756
And at the time that
this is called,


975
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:42,786
the bounds has yet
to be changed.


976
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:45,796
So if we asked this ScrollView
for its current bounds,


977
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:47,706
we'll find out the
previous contentOffset.


978
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:50,656
So that let us find out
how much has been scrolled


979
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,846
since the last time
this was called.


980
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:56,736
So we can do that by just
subtracting the y-coordinate


981
00:41:56,736 --> 00:41:57,976
of those two values.


982
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,896
We're only carrying about
vertical scrolling in this case,


983
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:02,326
so that's really easy to do,


984
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,206
we just get a CGFloat
for the delta.


985
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,116
And once we've got that,
we can stretch our springs


986
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,506
by shifting the positions
of each


987
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:12,156
of those layout attributes
objects.


988
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:15,866
The layout attributes represent
the current position on screen


989
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,756
of the elements and we want
them to resist scrolling.


990
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,996
So as we scroll up, we
want to shift them back


991
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:22,776
down by the delta
that we scrolled


992
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:25,586
and let the dynamic
system pull them into place


993
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:26,976
and bounce as it goes there.


994
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:31,256
Then the last bit that we
have to remember to do is


995
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:34,046
to tell the UIDynamic system
that we've made that change.


996
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:37,426
Now, this is a bit of
implementation detail--


997
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:38,436
not implementation detail.


998
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:42,756
It's an interesting behavior
of dynamics that you have


999
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:45,536
to understand to really be
able to do this which is


1000
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:48,316
that when you create
attachment behaviors


1001
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,766
or really any behaviors
in that dynamic system,


1002
00:42:51,386 --> 00:42:54,096
UIKit Dynamics pull off the
values out of your models


1003
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,756
into the dynamics
physics world at the time


1004
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:58,476
that you create the
attachment behavior.


1005
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:02,286
But we're going to go and update
that value by changing it,


1006
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:03,586
we just saw on the
previous line,


1007
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,826
by shifting the layout
attributes position.


1008
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,546
If we didn't tell the dynamics
system we had done that,


1009
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:10,466
it wouldn't get pulled
into the physics world,


1010
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:13,346
and so the physics system
wouldn't have any pulled spring


1011
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:13,976
to simulate.


1012
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,506
So we have to let this
dynamics system know


1013
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:17,686
that we've made this change.


1014
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:20,486
Now, this is actually going
to be done with a method


1015
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:22,146
that Eliza is going to
show you in a minute


1016
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,726
that will be available in SID
[phonetic] 2, so you'll be able


1017
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,976
to do this real soon now.


1018
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:32,026
To get us started on
building this, Eliza is going


1019
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,056
to come back and do our demo.


1020
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:39,296
[ Applause ]


1021
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:42,546
>> OK, so let's add this
springy behavior to the cells


1022
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:44,536
that I've already got in
my color collection view.


1023
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:47,766
In order to do that, we
need to write a subclass


1024
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:50,416
of UICollectionViewFlowLayout,
so I'm going


1025
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:56,726
to add that now, I think.


1026
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:59,096
There we go.


1027
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:02,016
So we will make a new class,


1028
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:07,706
we'll call it "Springy Flow
Layout" and it's a subclass


1029
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:11,496
of UICollectionViewFlowLayout,
add it to my target.


1030
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:15,446
All right, now in my View
Controller's [inaudible] file


1031
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,906
here, I'm going to zoom in a
little bit so that you can see.


1032
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:25,366
I've got this ScrollView which
contains the building view


1033
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,076
and the collection
view and then it also--


1034
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:30,296
and the collection view contains
a collection view flow layout.


1035
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:33,206
So to adopt this new subclass
that I'm about to write,


1036
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:35,396
it's going to be simply a
matter of changing the class


1037
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:39,316
of my CollectionViewFlowLayout
to be Springy Flow Layout.


1038
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,996
It's pretty easy.


1039
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:44,616
All right, so let's go ahead and
implement Springy Flow Layout.


1040
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:51,816
First thing we're going to
need in this flow layout is a--


1041
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:53,476
let's close this, yup.


1042
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,596
We're going to need
a dynamic animator.


1043
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:59,566
And we're going to want to
create the dynamic animator


1044
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:01,886
and fill it with springs.


1045
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:06,516
And we're going to do that by
overwriting the prepareLayout


1046
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:10,756
method of our super class which
is UICollectionViewFlowLayout.


1047
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:13,646
And we're taking advantages of
the fact that in prepareLayout,


1048
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:16,036
our supper class is doing
all the math for us.


1049
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:18,986
It's figuring out where all of
the different cells should go.


1050
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:20,706
And it's doing that here


1051
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:22,726
in the super implementation
of prepareLayout.


1052
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:27,056
So now that that's been
called, we can go ahead


1053
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:29,516
and create our dynamic
animator, if we haven't already.


1054
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:33,976
And then we can ask
the super class for all


1055
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:36,076
of the layout attributes
that it just computed.


1056
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:39,416
And we'll do that by
getting our content size,


1057
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:41,596
that's the collection
view content size.


1058
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:45,356
And then we'll simply ask the
super class to give us an array


1059
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:48,406
of all of the elements-- the
layout attributes for all


1060
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:51,026
of the elements in the Rect
that is our entire content.


1061
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:54,986
Now, this is a convenient
method that I'm using here.


1062
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:58,496
I've got 80 cells and not
that big a collection.


1063
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:01,276
If you had a collection of
hundreds of thousands of things


1064
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:03,466
or even maybe thousands of
things, you might not want


1065
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:04,816
to load them all into
memory at a time.


1066
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:08,286
So note that I am cheating
a little bit in this demo.


1067
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,516
At that point, you might want
to tile and I'll show you


1068
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,656
in a second where
you would do that.


1069
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:15,416
But-- all right, so for now
we've got all of our items


1070
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:17,946
and we're going to
iterate through them


1071
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:20,636
and make springs for each one.


1072
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:24,566
So a spring is
UIAttachmentBehavior.


1073
00:46:24,856 --> 00:46:28,256
We initialize it with the item
which is our layout attributes


1074
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:32,666
for that particular cell and we
attach it to the anchor point


1075
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,406
which is the item center.


1076
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:36,366
And that center was
calculated for us


1077
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:39,496
by the super implementation
of the flow layout.


1078
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,286
It figured out where that
item was supposed to go.


1079
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:45,216
So now that we've got a spring,
we need to set its length.


1080
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:47,146
Now this is the--
this is important.


1081
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:51,026
The spring's length has to
be zero because if you think


1082
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:53,666
about it, as we scroll, the
springs are going to stretch out


1083
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:56,306
and then the content is
going to bounce around.


1084
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:58,716
If the spring's length
was greater than zero,


1085
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,426
then it wouldn't be
guaranteed to come


1086
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:02,476
to rest right at
its anchor point.


1087
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:03,806
It could potentially
come to rest


1088
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:06,656
at an arbitrary location
somewhere near its anchor point.


1089
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:07,986
That would give you
a collection view


1090
00:47:07,986 --> 00:47:09,376
with some really weird behavior.


1091
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:11,966
When it came to rest, the cells
would be kind of overlapping


1092
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:13,406
and kind of off center.


1093
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:15,426
So we want our spring
to be length zero.


1094
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:19,316
We also need to set the dumping
and frequency of the spring


1095
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:21,626
which I've done by
trial and error.


1096
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,636
These values turned
out to be nice.


1097
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:26,886
And then we need to tell
our dynamic animator


1098
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:28,246
about this spring.


1099
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,126
So we add the spring
as a behavior


1100
00:47:31,126 --> 00:47:32,276
to the dynamic animator.


1101
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:34,946
All right, so now we
have done this once


1102
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:37,506
when the prepareLayout
method is first called


1103
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:41,476
and that will be good enough.


1104
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,376
We need to-- in addition,


1105
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:47,606
we need to implement
these two other methods,


1106
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:48,986
overwrite them, rather.


1107
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:51,246
So there's layoutAttributes
ForElementInRect.


1108
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:53,336
We have to overwrite that method


1109
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:58,246
to tell our collection view
what items are currently visible


1110
00:47:58,246 --> 00:47:59,096
in a particular Rect.


1111
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,676
And notice that the
super implementation


1112
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:04,336
of this wouldn't work
because we're moving the items


1113
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:06,116
around using this
dynamic system.


1114
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:09,366
So we have to ask the dynamic
animator which is keeping track


1115
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,646
of where they really are what's
currently available in the Rect


1116
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:18,916
and UIDynamics provides this
nice call through for that


1117
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,836
and the same exact logic goes


1118
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:23,586
for this layoutAttributes
ForItemAtIndexPath method.


1119
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:27,966
All right, so finally, we
just need to write the code


1120
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:30,496
to stretch the springs
when scrolling takes place.


1121
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:32,256
And as Josh explained,
we're going to do


1122
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:35,356
that in shouldInvalidate
LayoutForBoundsChange.


1123
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:39,506
Let me just get this to be
higher up on the screen.


1124
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:44,026
OK. So in shouldInvalidate
LayoutForBoundsChange,


1125
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:47,516
what we're going to do is
grab the ScrollView out,


1126
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:48,926
which is just our
collection view,


1127
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:53,956
and find out what its current--
well, how much we just scrolled


1128
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:56,316
because remember that
this, because the bounds


1129
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:59,156
of the ScrollView
change every time


1130
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:00,566
that its contentOffset changes,


1131
00:49:00,796 --> 00:49:02,586
we're going to find this
method getting called


1132
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:03,986
at every frame of scrolling.


1133
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:07,086
So we want to know, what is
the delta that we scrolled


1134
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:08,346
since the last time
this was called?


1135
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:11,636
And then we're going to go
through all of the springs


1136
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,836
that we made above and
we're going to stretch them


1137
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:20,796
by moving the item that that
spring owns by the amount


1138
00:49:20,796 --> 00:49:21,786
that we just scrolled.


1139
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:26,306
So, we grab the item
back out from the spring


1140
00:49:26,306 --> 00:49:32,406
which has an array of items
and then we get the center


1141
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:38,106
of the item, adjust it by the
scroll delta, set it again,


1142
00:49:38,486 --> 00:49:40,646
and finally call
our SUD 2 method,


1143
00:49:40,946 --> 00:49:44,566
Dynamic Animator Update Item
For Current State coming soon.


1144
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:48,016
And that will cause the
new center to be pulled


1145
00:49:48,016 --> 00:49:50,766
into the dynamic
system and it will cause


1146
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:52,416
that bouncy effect
to start happening.


1147
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:55,546
Now, the last thing we need


1148
00:49:55,546 --> 00:49:57,696
to do is tell this method
whether indeed it should


1149
00:49:57,696 --> 00:49:58,756
invalidate its layout.


1150
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:03,366
We're going to say No because
the dynamic animator is going


1151
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:04,646
to be moving the items around


1152
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:07,396
and that itself will invalidate
the layout, so we don't need


1153
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:08,436
to double invalidate it.


1154
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:10,446
We can say, "No, it doesn't
have to invalidate 'cause


1155
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:11,266
of the bounce change."


1156
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,626
Instead, it will be
invalidated in a second


1157
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:16,806
because of the moving
of the item.


1158
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,196
All right, so let's see
what that looks like.


1159
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:24,846
All right, so I'm going to grab
this cell, purple cell here,


1160
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:26,766
and I'm going to
start scrolling.


1161
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:30,536
Now, you'll notice we
have a bouncy effect.


1162
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:32,236
It's not really the
bouncy effect we wanted.


1163
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:35,726
First of all, my
finger, as presented


1164
00:50:35,726 --> 00:50:37,166
by this giant mouse pointer,


1165
00:50:37,486 --> 00:50:39,636
is coming off the
cell that I grabbed.


1166
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,816
See how it gets away ahead
and then when the thing comes


1167
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:43,416
to rest, it's back
under the finger again?


1168
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:45,816
This is really not the
behavior that we wanted.


1169
00:50:45,816 --> 00:50:46,586
There's two problems.


1170
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:47,796
First of all, the cell right


1171
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,486
under my finger should
track my finger.


1172
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:50,726
Otherwise, you have
this weird effect


1173
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:53,956
where you're not directly
manipulating the content.


1174
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:57,996
And second of all, all of the
cells are bouncing together.


1175
00:50:57,996 --> 00:50:59,636
They're not coming
apart as we wanted.


1176
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:03,016
So if you look back at the code,
this is actually not surprising.


1177
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:05,396
We're adjusting the
center of every single item


1178
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,906
in our collection view by the
same amount at every frame.


1179
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,106
So of course, they
don't come apart.


1180
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:12,656
And that's also why
that content is coming


1181
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:13,616
out from under my finger.


1182
00:51:13,906 --> 00:51:17,136
All of the cells are resisting
scrolling by the same amount.


1183
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,706
So I'm going to turn it back
over to Josh one more time


1184
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:23,086
to explain the technique
for actually fixing this


1185
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:24,826
and getting the behavior
that we want.


1186
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:30,906
[ Applause ]


1187
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:33,976
>> OK, so we left off on
last time that we're looking


1188
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:37,716
at our video of this stuff
with this exact look here,


1189
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:39,926
but we didn't actually play it.


1190
00:51:39,926 --> 00:51:42,856
If we had let go at this point
and allowed the dynamic system


1191
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:44,916
to take over and run
that spring simulation,


1192
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,986
we would've seen
exactly what Eliza saw


1193
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,606
of everything bouncing together.


1194
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,626
Now, of course, if we did
that a little bit more,


1195
00:51:51,626 --> 00:51:53,056
you'd see we stretched
the springs


1196
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:54,406
and they all move
the same amount


1197
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:55,466
and everything bounces together.


1198
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:58,236
It's exactly what we saw
happen in Eliza's demo


1199
00:51:58,476 --> 00:52:00,096
and clearly not what we
were trying to build.


1200
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:03,676
So what change do we have to
make in order to fix this?


1201
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:06,316
Well, we still want to move all


1202
00:52:06,316 --> 00:52:08,646
of the individual attachment
points together the same way


1203
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:09,556
that we thought we were doing.


1204
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:12,376
The thing that we want to do
differently is that we want


1205
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,256
to stretch the springs
at different amount.


1206
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:17,226
And we want to stretch them
by an amount that varies based


1207
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,826
on how far they are from the
user's finger on the screen.


1208
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:22,646
The ones that are directly
under the finger should stay


1209
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:24,126
under the finger
and track directly.


1210
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:26,496
So we don't want to stretch
those springs really at all


1211
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:28,976
because we don't want that to be
springy, we want it to follow.


1212
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:31,516
And the farther away the
cell gets from the finger,


1213
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:33,706
the more we want to
stretch out those springs.


1214
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,876
So that's going to look
something more like this.


1215
00:52:36,216 --> 00:52:38,056
The user puts their
finger down on the screen


1216
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:40,436
and starts scrolling,
the cell directly


1217
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:43,476
under it has stayed directly
under it, they've bunched


1218
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:45,666
up in the direction that
we're scrolling towards,


1219
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,596
and spread out in the direction
that we've scrolled away from.


1220
00:52:48,596 --> 00:52:52,336
And if you look at our green
lines here representing the


1221
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,316
spring lengths, you
can tell that the ones


1222
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:56,676
that are farther away from the
finger had been stretched more


1223
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:57,866
than the ones that
are right underneath.


1224
00:52:58,396 --> 00:53:03,116
If we let that go, then
they're individually going


1225
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:04,706
to bounce at different speeds.


1226
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,786
Each one's going to have
a slightly different feel


1227
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:08,286
and it'll get that
kind of behavior


1228
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,186
that we were looking for.


1229
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,926
So if we do that, we
see different amounts


1230
00:53:11,926 --> 00:53:14,496
of stretching varying by how
far it is from the finger,


1231
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,046
and we get that really nice
bouncing feel we were after.


1232
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:19,866
So Eliza is going to modify our
demo now to get that effect.


1233
00:53:20,516 --> 00:53:24,146
[ Applause ]


1234
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:27,396
>> All right, so we have a
ScrollView and that turns


1235
00:53:27,396 --> 00:53:28,396
out to be really convenient.


1236
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:30,626
We want to figure out where
did the user put their finger


1237
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:33,716
down so that we can stretch
the springs that are farther


1238
00:53:33,926 --> 00:53:36,016
from the finger more
than the springs


1239
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:36,996
that are right under the finger.


1240
00:53:37,806 --> 00:53:39,016
So, we'll use the fact


1241
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:42,546
that ScrollViews expose
their pan gesture recognizer


1242
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:47,456
and pan gesture recognizers
expose the location of the touch


1243
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:49,026
in whatever view you want.


1244
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:53,446
So we'll simply say the touch
location is the ScrollView's pan


1245
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:56,256
gesture recognizer's
location in the ScrollView.


1246
00:53:56,786 --> 00:53:59,366
So now we know where the
user has the touchdown


1247
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:03,666
and we can take advantage of
that to figure out how far


1248
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,816
that touch location is from
each individual spring.


1249
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:10,646
So, we'll grab the anchor point
of the spring that represents


1250
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:14,676
that particular cell's
resting position.


1251
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:19,016
And the distance from the
touch is just the difference


1252
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:20,396
between the y-coordinate


1253
00:54:20,396 --> 00:54:23,726
of the touch location
and the anchor point.


1254
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:28,486
Now we want to scale the amount


1255
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:32,526
that we resist the
scrolling by that distance.


1256
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,666
So I'm going to make a variable
here, scroll resistance,


1257
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:38,696
and it's just going
to be a fraction


1258
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:39,846
of the distance from the touch.


1259
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,536
Now this is something
you can play around with.


1260
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:44,156
Basically, the more scroll
resistance, the bouncier.


1261
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:47,666
So if I have a lot of scroll
resistance on a particular cell,


1262
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:49,656
then it's going to-- the
spring is going to stretch more


1263
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:51,036
and it's going to bounce more.


1264
00:54:51,336 --> 00:54:54,106
And so you can play with
different denominators here.


1265
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:56,336
This one gets us a fair
amount of bounciness.


1266
00:54:57,776 --> 00:55:02,956
So now, when we adjust
the center of the item,


1267
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:05,176
instead of just adding the
scroll delta, what we want


1268
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,856
to do is add the
scroll delta times


1269
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:10,546
that scroll resistance
fraction that we calculated.


1270
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:13,916
So when we're at a cell that's
right under the user's finger,


1271
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:16,036
the distance from the touch
is going to be pretty close


1272
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:17,866
to zero, so the scroll
resistance--


1273
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:20,976
rather, the amount that we're
changing the center will be


1274
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:21,856
very small.


1275
00:55:22,106 --> 00:55:24,786
And when the touch is
very far from the finger,


1276
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:27,196
we'll be changing
the center by more.


1277
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,316
So now there's one sort of--


1278
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:33,086
this isn't quite right as I've
written it because we never want


1279
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:36,426
to change the center
of this item by more


1280
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:37,266
than the scroll delta.


1281
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:41,226
We always want to be basically
adjusting it by something


1282
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:44,506
in between zero and the scroll
delta because if we changed it


1283
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:46,266
by more than the scroll
delta, then instead


1284
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:48,846
of just resisting scrolling,
it would actually be moving


1285
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,756
in the opposite direction
from scrolling,


1286
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:52,186
and that would be very strange.


1287
00:55:52,536 --> 00:55:57,016
So I'm going to, in
fact, have this at one.


1288
00:55:57,806 --> 00:56:00,356
So we want the minimum
of the scroll delta


1289
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:04,516
and then the adjusted scroll
delta by the scroll resistance.


1290
00:56:05,046 --> 00:56:06,546
All right, so with
that in place,


1291
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,146
we can go ahead and build this.


1292
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:12,446
Now, if I grab this
cell here and I scroll,


1293
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,606
it stays under my
finger, which is good.


1294
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:17,076
And-- oops.


1295
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:21,346
And the content bounces
around exactly as we hoped.


1296
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:24,556
The stuff in the direction of
scrolling gets closer together


1297
00:56:24,786 --> 00:56:29,556
and the stuff farther from the
scrolling gets farther apart.


1298
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:31,986
So that was the effect
that we wanted.


1299
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:33,706
Before I turn it
back over to Josh,


1300
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:36,716
because we have another minute
or so, let me just show you


1301
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:40,486
where you would do this
tiling that I mentioned.


1302
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:42,676
You don't want to load all
of these springs into memory


1303
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:45,946
at the same time, most
likely, in real use case.


1304
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:49,096
So here where I'm adding
behaviors to the spring,


1305
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:53,046
what you could basically do is
add only the behaviors that are


1306
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:56,126
in near what's visible on
the screen at a given time.


1307
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:57,396
And if you want to look at--


1308
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,896
look back at some of
our previous sessions,


1309
00:56:58,896 --> 00:57:00,106
we talked a lot about tiling.


1310
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:02,626
So this is a slightly weird
use of tiling where instead


1311
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,936
of tiling views, you're
tiling springs, just this--


1312
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,806
you're only making the
springs that you need in order


1313
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:10,776
to control the content
that's pretty close


1314
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:11,596
to what's on screen.


1315
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:13,036
And you can do that by--


1316
00:57:13,536 --> 00:57:16,196
over here in the
UIDynamicAnimator header,


1317
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:19,006
you can see that you can
both add and remove behaviors


1318
00:57:19,116 --> 00:57:20,986
from the dynamic animator.


1319
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:22,366
So if you wanted to do this


1320
00:57:22,366 --> 00:57:24,056
in a slightly more
memory-conscious way,


1321
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:26,496
that would be the place to look.


1322
00:57:26,496 --> 00:57:28,886
All right, so back over to Josh.


1323
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:34,716
[ Applause ]


1324
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:38,506
>> So not to point out bugs,
but some of you probably noticed


1325
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:39,686
that when scrolling down,


1326
00:57:39,686 --> 00:57:41,316
there wasn't quite
the same bouncy effect


1327
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:42,316
that we were hoping for there.


1328
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:45,886
That is a result of us changing
the demo late last night,


1329
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:48,986
and apparently not verifying
that we had done it correctly.


1330
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:52,226
There's actually-- I have made
that exact same mistake myself


1331
00:57:52,226 --> 00:57:54,826
at my desk when looking
at this demo in the past.


1332
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:57,086
There's actually an issue
where if you do the max


1333
00:57:57,086 --> 00:57:58,086
in that particular way,


1334
00:57:58,686 --> 00:58:01,706
you actually pick the value
that's always greater than zero


1335
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:03,286
and sometimes we
want to go negative.


1336
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:05,296
So max isn't always
what we want.


1337
00:58:05,336 --> 00:58:06,736
Sometimes we actually
want to go min.


1338
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:10,386
We could go back and fix that,
but maybe live debugging it


1339
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,006
on stage isn't the
best plan right now.


1340
00:58:12,186 --> 00:58:15,296
[Inaudible Remark] You can
go and find our bug later.


1341
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:17,606
>> It would've helped
if I built in run.


1342
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:22,016
>> So over the past few
years, we've had quite a few


1343
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:23,446
of these sessions, as
I mentioned earlier.


1344
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:26,086
Since 2009, there's been
a UIScrollView session


1345
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,806
and I wanted to give you
a real quick reference


1346
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:30,306
of the different kinds of topics
we'd covered in that time.


1347
00:58:31,686 --> 00:58:33,136
So, I don't expect
that you're going


1348
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:34,326
to read all these
right here right now,


1349
00:58:34,746 --> 00:58:36,476
but we've covered
a lot of stuff.


1350
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:39,726
We've got photo browsing,
tiling, infinite scrolling.


1351
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:41,536
We did a really interesting
thing


1352
00:58:41,536 --> 00:58:44,316
with OpenGL scrolling last year
so that you could figure out how


1353
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:47,926
to use UIScrollViews within your
OpenGL games and applications.


1354
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:50,606
I'd strongly encourage you,
if you're doing anything


1355
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:52,916
with UIScrollView, to come
back and look through this list


1356
00:58:53,306 --> 00:58:55,086
and see if there's anything
that applies to the things


1357
00:58:55,086 --> 00:58:57,556
that you're trying to do and
go and, you know, go back


1358
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:00,696
and watch some of these sessions
in the WWDC app that Jake has,


1359
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:02,906
you know, kindly given
us access to this year.


1360
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,566
If you have more
questions about this stuff,


1361
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,136
Jake Behrens is the UI
Frameworks Evangelist--


1362
00:59:08,496 --> 00:59:10,966
or sorry, the App
Frameworks Evangelist now.


1363
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:12,176
Documentation, of course,


1364
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:14,006
we've got the UIScrollView
Programming Guide


1365
00:59:14,156 --> 00:59:16,176
and the Apple Developer
Forums are a great place


1366
00:59:16,176 --> 00:59:17,366
to find out about this stuff.


1367
00:59:17,586 --> 00:59:18,836
You know, I'm on
there a lot and a lot


1368
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:19,986
of other folks are as well.


1369
00:59:19,986 --> 00:59:22,246
There are some related sessions.


1370
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,726
If you missed it, there's
the Building User Interfaces


1371
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:27,846
with iOS 7 one that was on
Tuesday, and Getting Started


1372
00:59:27,846 --> 00:59:29,486
with Dynamics was
also on Tuesday.


1373
00:59:29,896 --> 00:59:31,776
Later today, there's
an Advanced Techniques


1374
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:35,406
with UIKit Dynamics
actually right here at 3:15.


1375
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:37,706
So thanks very much for coming


1376
00:59:37,706 --> 00:59:39,396
and please enjoy
the rest of WWDC.


1377
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:41,016
