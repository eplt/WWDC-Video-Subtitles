[ Applause ]


3
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:30,866
>> Thank you so much,
and good morning.


4
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,976
And my name is David Hayward and
I'm here to talk to you today


5
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,726
about editing Live Photos


6
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:37,786
and processing RAW
images with Core Image.


7
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,886
We got a bunch of great
stuff to talk about today.


8
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,956
First I'll give a brief
introduction to Core Image


9
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,536
for those of you who
are new to the subject.


10
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,056
Then we'll be talking about
our three main subjects


11
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:47,746
for this morning.


12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,746
First we'll be adjusting
RAW images on iOS.


13
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:53,796
Second, we'll be
editing Live Photos.


14
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:56,706
And third, we'll be talking
about how to extend Core Image


15
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,276
in a new way using
CIImageProcessor nodes.


16
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:03,396
So first, so a very brief
introduction to Core Image.


17
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:07,696
The reason for Core Image is
that it provides a very simple,


18
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:10,716
high-performance API to
apply filters to images.


19
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:14,126
The basic idea is you start with
an input image that may come


20
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:16,936
from a JPEG or a file or
memory, and you can choose


21
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,556
to apply a filter to it and
the result is an output image,


22
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,356
and it's very, very easy
to do this in your code.


23
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,396
All you do is you take your
image, call applyingFilter,


24
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:29,466
and specify the name of the
filter and any parameters


25
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,946
that are appropriate
for that filter.


26
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:32,206
It's super easy.


27
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,586
And, of course, you can do
much more complex things.


28
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,496
You can chain together multiple
filters in either sequences


29
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,056
or graphs and get
very complex effects.


30
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:43,616
One of the great features


31
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,936
of Core Image is it provides
automatic color management,


32
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,236
and this is very
important these days.


33
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:52,136
We now have a variety of devices
that support wide gamut input


34
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,566
and wide gamut output.


35
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,856
And what Core Image will do is
it will automatically insert the


36
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,616
appropriate nodes
into the render graph


37
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:01,326
so that it will match
your input image


38
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:04,026
to the Core Image working
space, and when it comes time


39
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,396
to display, it will match


40
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,446
from the working space
to the display space.


41
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,696
And this is something you
should be very much aware


42
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:12,246
of because wide color images


43
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,606
and wide color displays
are common now


44
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,416
and many open source libraries


45
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,406
for doing image processing
don't handle this automatically.


46
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,766
So this is a great feature of
Core Image because it takes care


47
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,616
of all that for you in
a very easy to use way.


48
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,336
Another thing to be aware of is


49
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:32,016
that each filter actually has
a little bit of code associated


50
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,916
with it, a small
subroutine called a kernel.


51
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:38,576
And all of our built-in filters
have these kernels and one


52
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,916
of the great features is if
you chain together a sequence


53
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,336
of filters, Core Image will
automatically concatenate these


54
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,186
subroutines into
a single program.


55
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,186
The idea behind this is
to improve performance


56
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:52,436
by reducing the -- and
quality, by reducing the number


57
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:55,496
of intermediate buffers.


58
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,086
Core Image has over
180 built-in filters.


59
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,666
They are the exact
same filters on all


60
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:05,086
of our platforms;
macOS, tvOS and iOS.


61
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,676
We have a few new ones this year
which I'd like to talk about.


62
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,466
One is a new filter


63
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,236
for generating hue
saturation and value gradient.


64
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,336
It creates a gradient
in hue and saturation,


65
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:18,606
and then you can specify, as
a parameter, the brightness


66
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,906
of the image and also
specify the color space


67
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:21,696
that the wheel is in.


68
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:26,136
And as you might guess, this
filter is now used on macOS


69
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:30,486
as the basis of the color
picker, which is now aware


70
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:36,206
of the different types
of display color spaces.


71
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:39,526
Another new filter we have
is CINinePartStretched


72
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:40,556
and NinePartTiled.


73
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,546
The idea behind this is you
might have a small asset,


74
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,956
like this picture frame here,
and you want to stretch it


75
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:48,216
up to fit an arbitrary size.


76
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,976
This filter is very easy to use.


77
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:54,736
You provide an input image and
you provide four breakpoints,


78
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,536
two horizontal and two vertical.


79
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,206
Once you've specified
those points,


80
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,606
you can specify the size
you want it to stretch to.


81
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,336
It's very easy to use.


82
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:07,206
The third new filter is
something that's also


83
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,076
quite interesting.


84
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:11,516
The idea is to start
with a small input image.


85
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,856
In this case it's an image
containing color data,


86
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,036
but it can also contain
parametric data.


87
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,356
So imagine you have a small
set of colors or parameters


88
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,366
and maybe it's only 6 by 7
pixels and you want to upsample


89
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,076
that to the full
size of an image.


90
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,836
The idea is to upsample
the color image,


91
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,106
the small color image,


92
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,966
but respect the edges
in the guide image.


93
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,166
Now, if you weren't to
respect the guide images,


94
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,356
if you were just to stretch the
small image up to the same size


95
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:43,006
as the full image, you'd
just get a blend of colors,


96
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,046
but with this filter
you can get more.


97
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,506
You can actually get something


98
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:49,376
that preserves the edges while
also respecting the colors.


99
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,616
And this is actually a
useful feature for a lot


100
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,866
of other types of algorithms.


101
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,396
In fact, in the new version
of Photos app we use this


102
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,116
to improve the behavior of
the light adjustment sliders.


103
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:03,016
I look forward to
seeing how you can use


104
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:03,926
that in your application.


105
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:06,696
We also have some new
performance controls this year


106
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,106
and do things that
improve performance


107
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,036
in Core Image this year.


108
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,176
One is we have Metal
turned on by default.


109
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:16,926
So if you use any of
our built-in 180 filters


110
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:18,276
or your own custom kernels,


111
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,736
all of those kernels
will be converted


112
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,016
to Metal on the fly for you.


113
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,386
It's a great way of
leveraging the power of Metal


114
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:29,186
with very little
effort on your part.


115
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:32,356
We've also made some great
improvements to a critical API,


116
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,076
which is creating a
UIImage from a CIImage,


117
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,686
and this now produces
much better performance


118
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:38,516
than it has in the past.


119
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,636
So you can actually use
this very efficiently


120
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:45,216
to animate an image
in a UIImage view.


121
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,386
Also another new feature is


122
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,666
that Core Image now
supports a feature that's new


123
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,866
to Core Graphics, which is


124
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,366
that Core Graphics
supports half-floats.


125
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,446
Let me just talk for a
second about pixel formats


126
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:56,846
because this brings up
an interesting point.


127
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:01,196
We're all familiar with the
conventional pixel format


128
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:06,516
of RGBA8 and it takes just
4 bytes per pixel to store


129
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:10,246
and has 8 bits of depth,
and can encode values


130
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,426
in the range of 0 to 1.


131
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,006
However, this format
is not great


132
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:18,686
for representing wide-colored
data because it only has 8 bits


133
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,796
and it's limited to the
values in the range 0 to 1.


134
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:25,156
So in the past the alternative
has been to use RGBAfloat,


135
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,636
which takes 16 bytes per pixel,
so four times as much memory,


136
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:31,866
but gives you all the depth and
range you could ever hope for.


137
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,456
Another feature of the fact
that it's using floats is


138
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:37,056
that what quantization there is,


139
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,436
it's distributed
logarithmically,


140
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,326
which is a good fit for the way
the human eye perceives color.


141
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:45,486
Well, there's a new format
which Core Image has supported


142
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:48,286
and now Core Graphics does
as well, which I refer


143
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:51,536
to as the Goldilocks pixel
format, which is RGBAh,


144
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,256
and this allows you to,
in just 8 bytes per pixel,


145
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,816
store data that is 10 bits
of depth and allows values


146
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:03,216
in the range of minus
65,000 to positive 65,000.


147
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,806
And again, those values are
quantized logarithmically,


148
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,066
so it's great to store
linear data in a way


149
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,646
that won't be perceived
as quantized.


150
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,826
So I highly recommend
this pixel format.


151
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,306
There's another new format
which I should mention,


152
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:18,176
which is that Core Video
supports a pixel format


153
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,346
with the long name


154
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:23,626
of 30RGBLittle [inaudible]
PackedWideGamut,


155
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:27,646
and this also supports 10
bits of depth, but stores it


156
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:31,676
in an only 4 bytes per pixel by
sacrificing the alpha channel.


157
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,266
So there's many cases where
this is useful as well


158
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:37,816
and Core Image supports
either rendering from


159
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,966
or to CV pixel buffers
in this format.


160
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:45,756
So now I'd like to actually talk
about the next major subject


161
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,006
of our discussion today,
which is adjusting RAW images


162
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,686
with Core Image, and
I'm really excited


163
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:51,666
to talk about this today.


164
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,196
We've been working on
this for a long time.


165
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,676
It's been a lot of hard
work and I'm really excited


166
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,456
about the fact that we've
brought this to iOS.


167
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,536
In talking about this, I'd like
to discuss what is a RAW file,


168
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,796
how to use the CIRAWFilter API,


169
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:06,716
some notes on supporting
wide-gamut output,


170
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,166
and also tips for
managing memory.


171
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,776
So first, what is a RAW file?


172
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:17,546
Well, the way most cameras work
is that they have two key parts;


173
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,286
a color filter array
and a sensor array.


174
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:24,016
And the idea is light from the
scene enters from the scene


175
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,406
through the color filter array


176
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,546
and it's counted by
the sensor array.


177
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,016
And this data is actually
part of a much larger image,


178
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,716
of course, but in order to turn
this data into a usable image,


179
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:38,015
a lot of image processing
is needed in order


180
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,385
to produce a pleasing
image for the user.


181
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:43,066
So I want to talk a
little bit about that.


182
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,996
But the main idea here is
that if you take the data


183
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,416
that was captured by the
sensor, that is a RAW file.


184
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,056
If you take the data
that was captured


185
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:54,346
after the image processing,
that's a TIFF or a JPEG.


186
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:58,476
RAW files store the
unprocessed scene data,


187
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:02,266
and JPEG files store the
processed output image.


188
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,846
Another way to think of it is


189
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:06,646
that the RAW file
stores the ingredients


190
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,976
from which you can
make an image; whereas,


191
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:12,316
a JPEG stores the
results of the ingredients


192
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:14,466
after they've been baked
into a beautiful cake.


193
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:19,176
In order to go from
the ingredients


194
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,146
to a final baked product,
however, there is a lot


195
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,696
of stages, so let me just
outline a few of those here.


196
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,846
First of all, we have to
extract metadata from the file


197
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,966
that tells us how
long to cook the cake,


198
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,006
to extend the metaphor.


199
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,416
Also, we need to decode the
RAW data from the sensor.


200
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:39,406
We need to demosaic the image to
reconstruct the full color image


201
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,256
from the data that was captured


202
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,936
with only one RGB value
per pixel location.


203
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:48,506
We need to apply geometric
distortions for lens correction.


204
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:53,426
Noise reduction, which is a
huge piece of the processing.


205
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,226
We need to do color matching
from the scene-referred datas


206
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,256
that the sensor captured


207
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,936
into the output-referred
data for display.


208
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,296
And then we need to do
things like adjust exposure


209
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,206
and temperature and tint.


210
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:08,616
And lastly, but very
importantly, add sharpening,


211
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:11,576
contrast and saturation to
make an image look pleasing.


212
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,086
That's a lot of stages.


213
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,766
What are some of the
advantages of RAW?


214
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,476
Well, one of the great things is


215
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:21,306
that the RAW file contains
linear and deep pixel data,


216
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,986
which is what enables
great editability.


217
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:28,336
Another feature is that RAW
image processing gets better


218
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:29,316
every year.


219
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,056
So with the RAW you
have the promise


220
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,916
that an image you took yesterday
might have better quality


221
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,746
when you process it next year.


222
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,986
Also, RAW files are
color space agnostic.


223
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,316
They can actually be rendered
to any target output space,


224
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,846
which is also a good
feature, given the variety


225
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,896
of displays we have today.


226
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:52,176
Also, a user can choose
to use different software


227
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,316
to interpret the RAW file.


228
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,046
Just like giving
the same ingredient


229
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,266
to two different chefs, you
can get two different results,


230
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,116
and some users might prefer
one chef over another.


231
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:05,216
That said, there are some great
advantages to JPEG as well.


232
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,366
First of all, because the
processing has been applied,


233
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,936
they are fast to
load and display.


234
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,706
They contain colors
and adjustments


235
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,026
that target a specific
output, which can be useful.


236
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,146
And that also gives
predictable results.


237
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:23,986
Also, it's worth mentioning that
cameras do a great job today


238
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,556
of producing JPEG images,


239
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:30,806
and our iOS cameras are an
especially good example of that.


240
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,456
So on the subject of RAW,
let me talk a little bit


241
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:36,346
about how our platforms
support RAW.


242
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:41,526
So the great news is that now
we fully support RAW on iOS


243
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,286
and upcoming seed
on tvOS as well.


244
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,426
This means we support over
400 unique camera models


245
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,966
from 16 different vendors.


246
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,496
And also, we support DNG
files such as those captured


247
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,996
by our own iOS devices.


248
00:11:55,886 --> 00:12:01,736
The iOS devices include
the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, SE,


249
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,816
and also the iPad Pro 9.7.


250
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,426
That is really exciting.


251
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,096
I recommend you all go back,
if you haven't already,


252
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,306
and watch the Advances
in iOS Photography,


253
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,636
which talks about the new
APIs that are available


254
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:15,526
to capture RAW on these devices.


255
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:20,076
Another great thing is that
we now have the same high


256
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:24,396
performance RAW pipeline
on iOS as we do on macOS,


257
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,016
and this is actually
quite an achievement.


258
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,726
I counted the other day
and looked at our pipeline


259
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:34,026
and it involves over 4,500
lines of CIKernel code


260
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,406
and this all works
very efficiently


261
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:39,516
and it's a great testament to
our ability and the abilities


262
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:40,646
of Core Image to be able


263
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,956
to handle complex
rendering situations.


264
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:49,346
Our pipeline on iOS
requires A8 devices or later,


265
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,516
and you can test for this in
your application by looking


266
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:56,366
for the iOS GPU Family 2.


267
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,486
Another note on platform
support.


268
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,636
We continuously add
support for new cameras


269
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,576
as new ones become available,
and also to improve the quality


270
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,316
of existing cameras
that we already support.


271
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,866
New cameras are added in
future software updates.


272
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:13,186
And also, we improve our
pipeline periodically as well.


273
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,166
And our pipelines are versions,


274
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,466
so you can either use our
latest version or go back


275
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,056
and use previous
versions if you desire.


276
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:23,966
So without further ado, I
want to give a demonstration


277
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:24,976
of how this looks in action.


278
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:34,296
So what I have here
is some sample code.


279
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,556
There's an early version of that
that's available for download,


280
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,806
and it's called RAWExposed,
and this is both an application


281
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:42,946
and this latest version is
also a photo editing extension.


282
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,416
So what we can do is
we can go into Photos


283
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,816
and actually use
this sample code.


284
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,346
We have three RAW images here
that are 24 megapixels each


285
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,716
that were taken with
a Canon 5D Mark III.


286
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,556
And you can see here that
this image is pretty poorly


287
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,046
overexposed, but one of the
great features of RAW is


288
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,926
that you can actually
salvage images like this.


289
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:01,896
So we can go here and edit it


290
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,816
and use our photo
editing extension


291
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,136
to edit this as a RAW file.


292
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:10,706
So now, since we're
editing this as a RAW file,


293
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,016
we can actually make
adjustments [inaudible].


294
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:17,226
We can adjust the
exposure up and down.


295
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:21,486
You can see we can pan
across all the 24 megapixels


296
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,466
and we get great results.


297
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,246
Once I'm happy with the
image, this looks much better


298
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,046
than it did before,
I can hit Done


299
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:32,516
and it will generate a new
full resolution image of that,


300
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,316
and now it is actually
available to see


301
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:34,976
in the Photos application.


302
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:42,876
[ Applause ]


303
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,586
One of the other things
that's great in RAW files is


304
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,816
that you can make
great adjustments


305
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,046
on white balance in an image.


306
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,986
Again, on this image
the image is fine,


307
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:51,316
but it may be a little crooked,


308
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,706
but also the white
balance is off.


309
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,466
So I'm going to go in here


310
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:58,396
and adjust the white
balance just a little bit


311
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,916
and I can make a much
more pleasant image.


312
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,666
And again, we can zoom
in and see the results.


313
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,556
And we can adjust
these results live.


314
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,226
So we hit Done and save that.


315
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,096
Another image I want to
show is this image here,


316
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:13,656
which is actually
a very noisy image.


317
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,366
I want to show you a little bit


318
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,676
about our noise reduction
algorithms.


319
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,566
Over half of our 4,500 lines


320
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:21,486
of kernel code relate
to noise reduction.


321
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,906
So if I go in here
and edit this one,


322
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,176
you can see that there's some --


323
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:27,526
hopefully at least
in the front rows,


324
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,046
you can see the grain
that's in this image.


325
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:32,326
One of the features we expose
in our API is the ability


326
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,306
to turn off our noise
reduction algorithm,


327
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,746
and then you can actually
see the colorful nature


328
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,036
of the noise that's actually
present in the RAW file.


329
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,736
And it's this very
challenging task


330
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,596
of doing the noise
reduction to make an image


331
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,576
that doesn't have
those colorful speckles


332
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:49,276
but still preserves
nice color edges


333
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:50,766
that are intended in the image.


334
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:55,256
So I'll save that as well.


335
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:59,546
Lastly, I want to demonstrate an
image we took earlier this week


336
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,446
out in the lobby, which
was taken with this iPad.


337
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,966
Yes, I was one of those people
taking a picture with an iPad.


338
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,316
[ Laughter ]


339
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,586
And here I want to
show you, you know,


340
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,256
this is an image that's
challenging in its own way


341
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,706
because it's got some
areas that are dark


342
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,386
and some areas that
are overexposed.


343
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:18,986
One thing I could do here is I
could bring down the exposure --


344
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,796
well, I have a highlight
slider which can allow me


345
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:25,446
to bring the highlights
in a bit.


346
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,326
I can also bring
down the exposure.


347
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,166
And now I can really see what's
going on outside the windows.


348
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:32,236
But now the shadows
are too dark,


349
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,316
so I can then increase those.


350
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:36,786
So this gives you an idea of the
kind of adjustments you can do


351
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,656
on RAW files, and
this is the benefit


352
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,696
of having deeper
precision on your pixel data


353
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:42,826
that you get in a RAW file.


354
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,706
So I'll hit Done on that.


355
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,976
So that's our demo
of RAW in iOS.


356
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:55,546
[ Applause ]


357
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:57,956
And a huge thanks to the team
for making this possible.


358
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:01,836
So let me talk about the API,
because it's not just enough


359
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,706
to provide a demo application.


360
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,675
We want to enable your
applications to be able


361
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,006
to do this in your apps as well.


362
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,435
So we have an API
that's referred


363
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:11,096
to as the CIRAWFilter API,


364
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,046
and it gives your application
some critical things.


365
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:17,736
It gives your application
a CIImage with wide-gamut,


366
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,675
extended range, half-float
precision math behind it.


367
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,596
It also gives you control
over many of the stages


368
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,185
in the RAW processing pipeline,


369
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,465
such as those that
I demonstrated.


370
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,276
It also provides fast
interactive performance using


371
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,966
the GPU on all our devices.


372
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,786
So how does this
work in practice?


373
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,086
The API is actually very simple.


374
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:41,116
You start with an input, which
is either a file URL or data,


375
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,376
or even in our next
seed we'll have an API


376
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,356
that works using CVPixelBuffer.


377
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,456
That is our input.


378
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:48,876
We're then going to
create an instance


379
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,886
of a CIRAWFilter
from that input.


380
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:55,316
At the time that filter is
instantiated it will have


381
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:58,596
default values for all the
user adjustable parameters


382
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,086
that you might want to
present to your user.


383
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,716
Once you have the
CIRAWFilter, you can then ask it


384
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,966
for a CIImage, and you can
do lots of things from there.


385
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,156
Let me just show you the code


386
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,776
and how simple it
is just to do this.


387
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,026
All we need to do
is give it a URL.


388
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,076
We're going to create
an instance


389
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,696
of the CIFilter given that URL.


390
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,186
Then, for example, if
we want to get the value


391
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,616
of the current noise
reduction amount,


392
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,546
we can just access the value


393
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,546
for key kCIInput
ImageNoiseReductionAmount.


394
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,596
If we want to alter
that, it's equally easy.


395
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,156
We just set a new
value for that key.


396
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,246
When we're done making changes,


397
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,606
we ask for the outputImage
and we're done.


398
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:37,656
That's all we need to do.


399
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:40,276
Of course, you might want
to display this image,


400
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,516
so typically you'll take that
image and display it either


401
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:47,066
in a UIImage view or
in a MetalKit view


402
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,876
or other type of view system.


403
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,616
In this case the user might
suggest though that, well,


404
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,486
maybe this image is a
little underexposed,


405
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:57,466
so in your UI you can have
adjustable sliders for exposure


406
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,936
and then the user can
make that adjustment.


407
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:03,216
You can then pass that in as a
new value to the CIRAWFilter.


408
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,066
Then you can ask for
a CIImage from that,


409
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,676
and then you can then
display that new image


410
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,016
with the exposure
slightly brighter.


411
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,686
And this is very easy as well.


412
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:19,606
You also might want to take your
CIImage -- at times, let's say,


413
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:21,406
you want to export your
image in the background


414
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,716
to produce a full-size image,


415
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,356
or you may be exporting several
images in the background.


416
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:29,246
So you might want to, in those
cases, either create a CGImage


417
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:34,286
for passing to other APIs, or
go directly to a JPEG or a TIFF,


418
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,926
and we have some easy to
use APIs for that now.


419
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,376
If you're going to be
doing background processing


420
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:41,776
of large files like RAWs,


421
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:45,556
we recommend you create
a CIContext explicitly


422
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:46,396
for that purpose.


423
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:50,946
Specifically, you want to
specify a context that is saved


424
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,686
in a singleton variable,
so there's no need


425
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,586
to create a new context
for every image.


426
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,516
This allows CI to
cache the compilation


427
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,606
of all the kernels
that are involved.


428
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,566
However, because we're going to
be rendering an image only once,


429
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:06,336
we don't need Core Image to be
able to cache intermediates,


430
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,816
so you can specify false there,


431
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,066
and that will help reduce
the memory requirements


432
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,086
in this situation.


433
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,126
Also, there's a setting
to say that you want


434
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,296
to use a low priority
GPU render.


435
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:19,106
The idea behind this, if
you're doing a background save,


436
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,236
you don't want the
GPU usages required


437
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,216
for that background operation
to slow down the performance


438
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:26,636
of your foreground UI,
either if that's done


439
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,036
in Core Image or Core Animation.


440
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:30,966
So this is great for
background processing.


441
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,916
And a great new thing we're
announcing this year is


442
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:38,736
that this option is also
available on macOS, too.


443
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:42,026
Once you have your context,
then it's very simple.


444
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,666
You get to decide what color
space you want to render to.


445
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:46,936
For example, the
DisplayP3 colorSpace.


446
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,216
And then we have a
new convenience API


447
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,016
for taking a CIImage and
writing it to a JPEG.


448
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:52,826
Super easy.


449
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,786
You specify the CIImage,


450
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,586
the destination URL,
and the colorSpace.


451
00:20:58,786 --> 00:20:59,826
This is also a good time


452
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:03,556
to specify what compression
quality you want for the JPEG.


453
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,296
Now, in this case this will
produce an image that is a JPEG


454
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:10,406
that has been tagged with a
P3 space, which is a great way


455
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:14,046
of producing a wide-gamut image
that will display correctly


456
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:18,766
on any platform that supports
ICC-based color management.


457
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,036
However, if you think your
image will go to a platform


458
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,606
that doesn't support
color management,


459
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:25,266
we have a new option
that's available for you.


460
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,756
This is an option
that's available as part


461
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,416
of the CGImageDestination API,


462
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,776
and it's CGImageDestination
OptimizeForSharing.


463
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:37,556
The idea behind this is it
stores all the colors that are


464
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:40,906
in the P3 colorSpace, but
stores them in such a way


465
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,036
and with a custom profile,


466
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,196
such that that image will
still display correctly


467
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:47,746
if your recipient of that
image doesn't support


468
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:48,446
color management.


469
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,016
So this is a great
feature as well.


470
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:55,616
Another thing is if you want
to actually create a CGImage


471
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,296
from a CIImage, we have a
new API for that as well


472
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,296
with some new options.


473
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,116
We have this convenience
API which allows you


474
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:04,836
to specify what the
colorSpace and the pixel format


475
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,106
that you want to render to is.


476
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:10,236
You may choose, however,
now you to create a CGImage


477
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,486
that has the format of RGBAh,


478
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,926
the Goldilocks pixel format
I was talking about earlier.


479
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:17,366
And in that case you
might also choose


480
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,606
to use a special color space,


481
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,126
which is the extendedLinearSRGB
space.


482
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:23,566
Because the pixel format
supports values outside


483
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:27,776
of the range 0 to 1, you want
your color space to as well.


484
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,536
Another option that we have
that's new is being able


485
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,816
to specify whether the act


486
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:34,136
of creating the CGImage
does the work


487
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:35,746
in a deferred or
immediate fashion.


488
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:39,746
If you specify deferred,
then the work that's involved


489
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:43,506
in rendering the CIImage
into a CGImage takes place


490
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:44,776
when the CGImage is drawn.


491
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,996
This is a great way
of minimizing memory,


492
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:49,116
especially if you're only
going to be drawing part


493
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,366
of that CGImage later,
or if you're only going


494
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:52,856
to be drawing that CGImage once.


495
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,946
However, if you're
going to be rendering


496
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:58,886
that image multiple times, you
can specify deferred false,


497
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:02,346
and in that case Core Image
will do the work of rendering


498
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,576
into the CGImage at the time
this function is called.


499
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:07,796
So this is a great new,
flexible API that we have


500
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:08,806
for your applications.


501
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:14,926
Another advanced feature of this
Core Image filter API that I'd


502
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,256
like to talk about
today is this.


503
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:20,706
As I mentioned before, there's
a long stage of pipeline


504
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:24,126
in processing RAW files, and
a lot of people ask me, well,


505
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:27,416
how can I add my own
processing to that pipeline.


506
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:31,076
Well, one common place
where developers will want


507
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,946
to add processing to the
RAW pipeline is somewhere


508
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,156
in the middle; after the
demosaic has occurred,


509
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:39,366
but before all the nonlinear
operations like sharpening


510
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,426
and contrast and color
boosting has occurred.


511
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,656
So we have an API just for this.


512
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,456
It's a property on the
CIRAWFilter which allows you


513
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,746
to specify a filter
that gets inserted


514
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,386
into the middle of our graph.


515
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:54,586
So I look forward to seeing what
you guys can imagine and think


516
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:56,496
of and what can go
into this location.


517
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:01,996
Some notes on wide-gamut
output that I mentioned before.


518
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:06,156
The CIKernel language supports
float precision as a language.


519
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,936
However, whenever a
CIFilter needs to render


520
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:13,796
to an intermediate buffer, we
will use the working format


521
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,336
of the current CIContext.


522
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:20,196
On macOS the default
working format is RGBA,


523
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:21,356
our Goldilocks format.


524
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:26,386
On iOS and tvOS our default
format is still BGRA8,


525
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,636
which is good for performance,


526
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:30,656
but if you're rendering
extended range data,


527
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:33,276
that may not be what you want.


528
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:38,186
Our RAW pipeline, with this
in mind, all of the kernels


529
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:43,066
in our pipeline force the usage
of RGBA half-float precision,


530
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:44,946
which is critical for RAW files.


531
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:48,566
But as you might guess,
if you are concerned


532
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:51,216
about wide-gamut input
and output and preserving


533
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:53,126
that data throughout
a rendered graph,


534
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,586
you should modify your CIContext
when you create it to specify


535
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,496
that you want a working
format that is RGBAh.


536
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:04,626
I should also mention again


537
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,666
that Core Image supports
a wide variety


538
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,216
of wide-gamut output spaces.


539
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:12,556
For example, you can render to
extendedLinearSRGB or Adobe RGB


540
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:16,066
or DisplayP3, whatever
format you wish.


541
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:18,646
Now, as I mentioned before,


542
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,886
I was demonstrating
a 24-megapixel image.


543
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,026
RAW files can be a lot
larger than you might think.


544
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:26,286
RAW files can be large and
they also require several


545
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,676
intermediate buffers to render
all the stages of the pipeline.


546
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,756
And so it's important
that in order


547
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:34,436
to reduce the high water
memory mark of your application


548
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:37,066
that you use some of these APIs
that I've talked about today,


549
00:25:37,356 --> 00:25:39,866
such as turning off caching
intermediates in cases


550
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,206
where you don't need it,


551
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,106
or using the new write JPEG
representation of image,


552
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:44,976
which is very efficient,


553
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:47,436
or specifying the
deferred rendering


554
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:48,546
when creating a CGImage.


555
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,576
Some notes on limits
of RAW files.


556
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,226
On iOS devices with 2
gigabytes of memory or more,


557
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,896
we support RAW files
up to 120 megapixels.


558
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:01,976
So we're really proud to
be able to pull that off.


559
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:07,946
[ Applause ]


560
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:12,976
On apps running on devices with
1 gigabyte of memory we support


561
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:16,856
up to 60 megapixels, which is
also really quite impressive.


562
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:19,496
And this also holds true for
photo editing extensions,


563
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:24,216
which run in a lesser
amount of memory.


564
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,546
So that's our discussion of RAW.


565
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,566
Again, I'm super proud to be
able to demonstrate this today.


566
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,646
I would like to hand the
stage over to Etienne


567
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,056
who will be talking about
another great new image format


568
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,796
and how you can edit those in
your application, Live Photos.


569
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:35,976
Thank you.


570
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:42,826
[ Applause ]


571
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:43,956
>> Thank you, David.


572
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:44,886
Hello everyone.


573
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,066
I'm really excited to be
here today to talk to you


574
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,226
about how you can edit Live
Photos in your application.


575
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:54,856
So first, we're going to go
over a quick introduction


576
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,736
of what are Live Photos, then
we see what you can edit,


577
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:02,996
and then we'll go
step-by-step into the code


578
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,236
and see how you can get
a Live Photo for editing,


579
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:10,476
how you can then set up a
Live Photo Editing context,


580
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:14,066
how you can apply Core Image
filters to your Live Photo,


581
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:19,196
and how you can preview your
Live Photo in your application,


582
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:22,926
and finally, how you can save
an edited Live Photo back


583
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:25,696
into the Photo Library, and
we'll finish with a quick demo.


584
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:27,036
All right.


585
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:27,786
So let's get started.


586
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:32,046
So Live Photos, as you may know,


587
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:35,396
are photos that also include
motion and sound from before


588
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:37,406
and after the time
of the capture.


589
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:42,426
And Live Photos can be
captured on the new devices


590
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:47,726
such as iPhone 6S, 6S Plus,
iPhone SE and iPod Pro.


591
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:52,206
In fact, Live Photo is
actually a default capture mode


592
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:55,036
on those devices, so you
can expect your users


593
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:57,606
to already have plenty of Live
Photos in their Photo Library.


594
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,466
So what's new this
year about Live Photos?


595
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:06,366
So first, users can now
fully edit their Live Photos


596
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,206
in Photos.


597
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,676
They can apply -- all the
adjustment that they would


598
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:11,966
to a regular photo they
can apply to a Live Photo.


599
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:16,716
Next we have a new API
to capture Live Photos


600
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:20,136
in your application and for
that, for more information


601
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:23,496
about that, I strongly recommend
that you watch this Advances


602
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,526
in iOS Photography session that
took place earlier this week.


603
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:30,026
It also includes a lot of
information about Live Photos


604
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,126
from the capturer point of view.


605
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:34,596
And finally, we have a new
API to edit Live Photos,


606
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:36,266
and that's why I'm here
to talk about today.


607
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,036
All right.


608
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,516
So what can be edited exactly?


609
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:44,186
Right. So first, of course,
you can edit the content


610
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:47,096
of the photo, but
you can also edit all


611
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,516
of the video frames as well.


612
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:51,636
You can also address
the audio volume,


613
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,326
and you can change the
dimensions of the Live Photo.


614
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:58,736
Things you can't do though is


615
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,476
that you can't change
the duration


616
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:05,196
or the timing of the Live Photo.


617
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:09,386
So in order to get a Live Photo
for editing, the first thing


618
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,076
to do is to actually get a Live
Photo out of the Photo Library.


619
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,196
So there's two ways to do that,


620
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:15,696
depending on whether you're
building a photo editing


621
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:18,266
extension or a PhotoKit
application.


622
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:22,156
In the case of a photo
editing extension you need


623
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,026
to start first by opting
in to Live Photo editing


624
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:28,216
by adding the LivePhoto
string in your array


625
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:30,786
of supported media types
for your extension.


626
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:36,146
And next, in your implementation
of startContentEditing,


627
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:39,596
that's called automatically,


628
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,646
you can expect the content
editing input that you receive


629
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:47,046
and you can check the media
type and the media subtypes


630
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,776
to make sure that
this is a Live Photo.


631
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,096
Okay. On the other hand,


632
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,096
if you're building a
PhotoKit application,


633
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:58,336
you have to request the
contentEditingInput yourself


634
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:01,836
from a PHAsset, and then
you can check the media type


635
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:04,586
and media subtypes
in the same way.


636
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:05,126
All right.


637
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:08,446
So the next step would be to set
up a LivePhotoEditingContext.


638
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:12,116
A LivePhotoEditingContext
includes all the resources


639
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:13,806
that are needed to
edit Live Photos.


640
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,066
It includes information
about the Live Photo,


641
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,096
such as its duration,
the time of the photo,


642
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:23,686
the size of the Live Photo,
also the orientation, all that.


643
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:28,026
It also has a frame processor
property that you can set


644
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,936
to actually edit the
contents of Live Photo,


645
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,506
and I'll tell you more
about that in a minute.


646
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,966
You can adjust the
audio volume as well.


647
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,686
You can ask the
LivePhotoEditingContext


648
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,066
to prepare a Live
Photo for playback,


649
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:46,166
and you can ask the
LivePhotoEditingContext to save


650
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:47,546
and process a Live Photo


651
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,946
for saving back to
the Photo Library.


652
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:52,906
Creating a
LivePhotoEditingContext is


653
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:53,416
really easy.


654
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,456
All you need to do is
institute a new one


655
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,236
from a LivePhotoEditingInput
for a Live Photo.


656
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:00,876
All right.


657
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,916
So now let's take a look at how


658
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,016
to use the frame processor
I mentioned earlier.


659
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:07,886
So the frame of a Live
Photo I'll describe


660
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:11,836
by a PHLivePhotoFrame object
that contains an input image,


661
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,856
which is a CIImage
for that frame.


662
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,446
Type, which is whether it's a
video frame or a photo frame.


663
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,186
And the time of the
frame in the Live Photo,


664
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:24,756
as well as the resolution
at which


665
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:25,906
that frame is being rendered.


666
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:32,376
In order to implement a frame
processor you would set the


667
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:35,436
frame processor property on
the LivePhotoEditingContext


668
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:40,606
to be a block that takes
a frame as parameter


669
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:43,956
and returns an image
or an error.


670
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:47,436
And here we just simply return
the input image of the frame,


671
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:50,626
so that's just necessarily
a node frame processor.


672
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,416
So now let's take a
look at the real case.


673
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:57,766
This is a Live Photo, as
you can see in Photos,


674
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:01,026
and I can play it right there.


675
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:04,156
And so let's say we want


676
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:07,026
to apply a simple basic
adjustment to the Live Photo.


677
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,466
That's start with a
simple square crop.


678
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:11,246
Here's how to do that.


679
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:15,376
In the implementation of
your frame processor you want


680
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,616
to start with the input
image for the frame.


681
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,396
Then you compute your crop rect.


682
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:24,316
Then you crop the image
using [inaudible] here,


683
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:27,046
which is called the
cropping through rect,


684
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:28,996
and just return that
cropped image.


685
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:32,326
That's all it takes to actually
edit and crop the Live Photo.


686
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:33,686
Here's the result.


687
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:37,096
I can place side photo, you
can see the photo is cropped,


688
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:40,126
but the video is also
cropped as I play it.


689
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:41,466
All right.


690
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:45,556
So that's an example of a
very basic static adjustment.


691
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:49,706
Now, what if we want to apply
a more dynamic adjustment,


692
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:52,636
and that is one that will
actually depend on the time


693
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,276
and will change while the
Live Photo is being played.


694
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,826
So you can do that, too.


695
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,646
So here let's build up
on that crop example


696
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,106
and implement the dynamic crop.


697
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,386
So here's how to do it.


698
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:08,666
So first we need to capture
a couple of information


699
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:12,236
about the timing of the Live
Photo, such as the exact time


700
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,716
of the photo because we want
the effect to stay the same


701
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:18,266
and have your crop rect really
centered on the Live Photo.


702
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:23,196
Next we take it so we capture
the duration of the Live Photo.


703
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:27,046
And you can notice
that we do that outside


704
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,706
of the frame processor
block and that's


705
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,306
to avoid cycling dependency.


706
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:37,636
Here in the block we can ask for
the exact time of that frame,


707
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,676
and then we can build a
function of time using all


708
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,946
that information to
drive a crop rect.


709
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:46,456
And here's what the result.


710
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:48,746
So you can see the Live Photo
is cropped the same way,


711
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,806
the photo is the same,
but when I play it,


712
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:56,446
you can see that the crop rect
now moves from bottom to top.


713
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:56,926
All right.


714
00:33:56,926 --> 00:33:59,506
So that's an example of
a time-based adjustment.


715
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,186
Now let's take a look
at something else.


716
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:05,036
This effect is interesting


717
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:07,936
because it's a
resolution-dependent effect.


718
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:13,835
What I mean by that is that the
way the filter parameters are


719
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:17,005
specified, they're
specified in pixels, right,


720
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:19,545
which mean that you
need to be extra careful


721
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:21,536
when you apply these kind
of effects to make sure


722
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,726
that the effect is visually
consistent regardless


723
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:27,356
of the resolution at which the
Live Photo is being rendered.


724
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,616
So here if I play it, you
can see that the video --


725
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:32,106
the effect is applied


726
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:33,795
to the video the same way
it's applied to the photos.


727
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:34,286
So that's great.


728
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,996
So let's see how to
do that correctly.


729
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:41,126
So in your frame processor
you want to pay attention


730
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:43,565
to this renderScale
property on the frame.


731
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,326
This will give you
the resolution


732
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:48,436
of the current frame compared


733
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:52,755
to the one-to-one full-size
still image in the Live Photo.


734
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:57,406
So keep in mind that
the video frames


735
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,606
and the photo are
different size as well.


736
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:02,176
Right. Usually the video is
way smaller than the photo is.


737
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:04,806
So you want to make sure
to apply that correctly.


738
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:09,606
In order to do that, you can
use the scale here to scale


739
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:12,866
down that width parameter
so that at one-to-one


740
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:15,166
on the full-size photo
the parameter will be 50,


741
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,706
but it will be smaller on
the smaller resolution.


742
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:24,046
Another way to apply your
resolution-dependent adjustment


743
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:30,246
is to use the extent of
the image like I do here


744
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,286
for the inputCenter parameter.


745
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,986
I actually use the midpoint of
the image and that's granted


746
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,346
to also scale [inaudible].


747
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:39,686
All right.


748
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:42,716
One more edit on that image.


749
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:48,696
You can notice that I did a logo
here that might be familiar,


750
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:52,006
and when I play it, you see


751
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:54,126
that the logo actually
disappears from the video.


752
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:59,056
So this is how you would apply
an adjustment just to the photo


753
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,676
and not to the video,
and here's how to do it.


754
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:06,736
In your implementation of your
frame processor you want to look


755
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:10,516
at the frame type, and here
we just check if it's a photo,


756
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:12,006
then we composite the still logo


757
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,506
into the image, but
not on the video.


758
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:16,926
So that's as easy as that.


759
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,986
And you may have, you
know, some adjustments


760
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:22,716
that are local advertisement or
single ad that you don't want


761
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:24,556
to apply or you can't
apply to the video,


762
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:28,206
and so that's a good
way to do it.


763
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:28,756
All right.


764
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:31,086
Now that we have an
edited Live Photo,


765
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:35,946
let's see how we can
preview it in our app.


766
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:39,766
So in order to preview a
Live Photo you want to work


767
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:40,946
with the PHLivePhotoView.


768
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:44,316
So this view is readily
available on iOS


769
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:46,696
and is new this year on macOS.


770
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:50,826
So in order to preview
Live Photo you need


771
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:53,406
to ask the
LivePhotoEditingContext


772
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:56,666
to prepare a Live Photo
for playback and you pass


773
00:36:56,666 --> 00:37:01,966
in the target size, which is
typically the size of your view


774
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:06,076
in pixels, and then you get
called back asynchronously


775
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:09,056
on the main thread with
a rendered Live Photo.


776
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:13,066
And then all you need to do
is set the Live Photo property


777
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:17,136
of the LivePhotoView so that
your users can now interact


778
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,816
with their Live Photo
and get an idea


779
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:24,436
of what the edited Live
Photo will look like.


780
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:27,576
Now, the final set will be to
save back to the Photo Library.


781
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:32,476
And that, again, depends whether
you're building a photo editing


782
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:34,786
extension or a PhotoKit
application.


783
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:39,026
In the case of a photo
editing extension you will


784
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:40,456
implement finishContentEditing.


785
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:45,346
And the first step is to create
a new contentEditingOutput


786
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,526
from that contentEditingInput
that you received earlier.


787
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,266
And next you will ask your
LivePhotoEditingContext


788
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,206
to save the Live
Photo to that output.


789
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:59,156
And again, that will process
the full resolution Live Photo


790
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:02,226
asynchronously and call
you back on the main thread


791
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,176
with success or error.


792
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:07,626
And in the case everything
goes fine,


793
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:11,186
make sure you save also
your adjustment data along


794
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:15,116
with your edits and that will
allow your users to go back


795
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:20,536
to your app or extension later
and continue editing there.


796
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,756
And then last step is


797
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:24,266
to actually call the
completionHandler


798
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:25,886
for that extension
and you're done.


799
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,086
If you're building a
PhotoKit application,


800
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,756
the steps are really similar.


801
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:35,926
The only difference really
that you have to make your --


802
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:38,966
they are from the changes
[inaudible] yourself using


803
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,306
a PHAssetChangeRequest.


804
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:40,806
All right.


805
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:42,976
So now I'd like to
show you a quick demo.


806
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,036
All right.


807
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:58,326
So I've built a simple demo
Live Photo extension that I'd


808
00:38:58,326 --> 00:38:59,146
like to show you today.


809
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,656
So here I am in Photos and I can
see a couple Live Photos here,


810
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:06,286
can pick to see the contents.


811
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:09,506
I can swipe and see
them animate.


812
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:10,586
All right.


813
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:11,936
That's the one I
want to edit today.


814
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:13,806
So I can go to edit.


815
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:14,966
And as I mentioned earlier,


816
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:18,216
I can actually edit the Live
Photo right there in Photos.


817
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:19,296
Let me do that.


818
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:22,096
I'd like to apply
this new light slider


819
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,766
that David mentioned earlier.


820
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:25,366
All right.


821
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:29,786
So here in Photos I
can just play that.


822
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:35,766
Right. Of course, I could
stop here, but I actually want


823
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:38,116
to apply my sample
edits as well.


824
00:39:38,116 --> 00:39:40,966
So I'm going to pick
my extension here.


825
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:50,806
And, yes, we actually apply the
same adjustment that we went


826
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,646
through for the slides.


827
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:55,956
And you can see this is
really a simple extension,


828
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,156
but it shows a LivePhotoView,
so I can interact with this


829
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:01,736
and I can actually press
to play it, like this,


830
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:03,136
right in my extension.


831
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:05,146
So that's real easy.


832
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:08,556
And the next step is to actually
save by hitting Done here.


833
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:13,146
And this is going to process
a full resolution Live Photo


834
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:15,296
and send it back to
the Photo Library.


835
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,176
And there it is,
right there in Photos.


836
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:20,366
All right.


837
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:22,996
So that was for the quick demo.


838
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:23,966
Now back to slides.


839
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:29,886
[ Applause ]


840
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:30,756
Thank you.


841
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:32,326
All right.


842
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:35,646
So here's a quick summary of
what we've learned so far today.


843
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:39,326
So we've learned how
to get a Live Photo


844
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:44,326
out of the Photo Library
and how to use and set


845
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:47,686
up a LivePhotoEditingContext,
how to use a frame processor


846
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,256
to edit the contents
of the Live Photo.


847
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,226
We've seen how to
preview a Live Photo


848
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:56,146
in your app using
the LivePhotoView.


849
00:40:57,236 --> 00:41:00,396
And we've seen how to
save a Live Photo back


850
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:03,156
into the Photo Library.


851
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,966
Now I can't wait to see what
you will do with this new API.


852
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,226
A few things to remember.


853
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:12,406
First, if you're building
a photo editing extension,


854
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:15,486
do not forget to opt
in to LivePhotoEditing


855
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,306
in your info.plist
for your extension.


856
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:19,856
Otherwise, you'll get a still
image instead of a Live Photo.


857
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:24,516
And as I said, make sure you
always save adjustment data


858
00:41:24,956 --> 00:41:28,526
as well so that your users
can go back to your app


859
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,396
and continue the edit
nondestructively.


860
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:36,376
Finally, I think if you
already have an image editing


861
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:40,956
application, adopting Live
Photo and adding support


862
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,496
for LivePhotoEditing should be
really easy with this new API,


863
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:47,986
especially if your app is
using Core Image already.


864
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:52,066
And if not, there's actually
a new API in Core Image


865
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:54,926
to let you integrate your
own custom processing


866
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:55,766
into Core Image.


867
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,886
And to tell you all about it,


868
00:41:57,886 --> 00:41:59,796
I'd like to invite
Alex on stage.


869
00:41:59,796 --> 00:41:59,976dle
Thank you.


870
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:06,546
[ Applause ]


871
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:07,566
>> Thank you, Etienne.


872
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,156
So my name is Alexandre Naaman,
and today I'm going to talk


873
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:11,926
to you about some new
functionality we have inside


874
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:14,026
of Core Image to do
additional effects


875
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,646
that weren't possible
previously, and that's going


876
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:18,486
to be using a new API
called CIImageProcessor.


877
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:22,596
As David mentioned earlier,
there's a lot you can do inside


878
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:26,486
of Core Image using our
existing built-in 180 filters,


879
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,656
and you can extend
that even further


880
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,136
by writing your own
custom kernels.


881
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,826
Now with CIImageProcessor
we can do even more,


882
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:38,316
and we can insert a new node
inside of our render graph


883
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:42,186
that can do basically
anything we want and will fit


884
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:43,556
in perfectly with
the existing graph.


885
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:47,436
So we can write our own custom
CPU code or custom Metal code.


886
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:52,386
So there are some analogies
when using CIImageProcessor


887
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:54,786
with writing general kernels.


888
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:57,466
So in the past you would
write a general kernel,


889
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:02,026
specify some string, and then
override the output image method


890
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:07,136
on your CIFilter and
provide the extent,


891
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:09,046
which is the output image
size that you're going


892
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:12,076
to be creating, and
an roiCallback,


893
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,686
and then finally whatever
arguments you need


894
00:43:16,686 --> 00:43:18,406
to pass to your kernel.


895
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:22,136
Now, there are a
lot of similarities


896
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:24,836
with creating CIImageProcessors,
and we're not going to go


897
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,166
into detail with them
about that today.


898
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:30,656
Instead we refer
you to Session 515


899
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:32,886
from our WWDC talk from 2014.


900
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:35,426
So if you want to
create CIImageProcessors,


901
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:38,036
we strongly suggest you go
and look back at that talk


902
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:40,346
because we talked about
how to deal with the extent


903
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:43,286
and ROI parameters
in great length.


904
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:46,876
So now let's look
at what the API


905
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:49,036
for creating a CIImage
Processor looks like,


906
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:52,026
and this may change a
little bit in future seeds,


907
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,956
but this is what it
looks like right now.


908
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,666
So the similarities are there.


909
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,846
We need to provide the extent,


910
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,666
which is the output image size
we're going to be producing,


911
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,946
give it an input
image, and the ROI.


912
00:44:04,036 --> 00:44:06,386
There are a bunch of additional
parameters we need to provide,


913
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:09,586
however, such as, for example,
the description of the node


914
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:10,206
that we'll be creating.


915
00:44:11,476 --> 00:44:14,606
We then need to provide a
digest with some sort of hash


916
00:44:14,606 --> 00:44:15,906
of all our input parameters.


917
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:18,066
And this is really
important for Core Image


918
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,226
because this is how Core
Image determines whether


919
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:22,636
or not we can cache the
values or not, and whether


920
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:23,746
or not we need to rerender.


921
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:25,316
So you need to make sure


922
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:27,146
that every time your
parameter changes,


923
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:28,956
that you update the hash.


924
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:34,656
The next thing we can
specify is an input format.


925
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,196
In this case here
we've used BGRA8,


926
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,356
but you can also specify zero,


927
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:43,256
which means you'll get the
working format for the context


928
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:46,286
as an input image format.


929
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:48,716
You can specify the
output format as well.


930
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:51,356
In this case we're using
RGBAf because the example


931
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,696
that we're going to be going
over in more detail needs a lot


932
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:55,276
of precision, so we'll
need full flow here.


933
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:58,466
And then finally we get
to our processor block,


934
00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:00,426
which is where we have
exactly two parameters;


935
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:05,596
our CIImageProcessorInput
and CIImageProcessorOutput,


936
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:08,956
and it's inside of here that
we can do all the work we need


937
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,246
to do.


938
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,396
So let's take a look
at how we can do this,


939
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:14,106
and why you would
want to do this.


940
00:45:16,236 --> 00:45:19,616
So CIImageProcessor
is particularly useful


941
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,876
for when you have some algorithm
or you want to use a library


942
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:26,216
that implements something
outside of Core Image


943
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,556
and something that
isn't suitable


944
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:28,636
for the CIKernel language.


945
00:45:28,886 --> 00:45:31,936
A really good example of this is
what we call an integral image.


946
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:35,296
An integral image is an image
whereby the output pixel


947
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:37,896
contains the sum of
all the pixels above it


948
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:39,446
and to the left,
including itself.


949
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:42,716
And this is a very good
example of the kind of thing


950
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:45,716
that can't be done in a
data parallel-type shader,


951
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,296
which is the kind of
shader that you write


952
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:48,626
when you're writing CIKernels.


953
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:54,286
So let's take a look at
what an integral image is


954
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:55,136
in a little bit more detail.


955
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,946
If we start off with the input
image on the left, which,


956
00:45:57,946 --> 00:46:01,386
let's say, corresponds to some
single channel, 8-bit data,


957
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:04,596
our integral image would
be the image on the right.


958
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:07,366
So if we take a look
at this pixel here, 7,


959
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:11,146
it actually corresponds to
the sum of all of those pixels


960
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,216
on the left, which would
be 1 plus 4 plus 0 plus 2.


961
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:19,026
The same goes for this other
pixel; 45 corresponds to the sum


962
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,196
of all those other pixels above
it and to the left, plus itself.


963
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:29,146
So now let's take a look
at what you would do inside


964
00:46:29,146 --> 00:46:33,346
of the image processor block
if you were writing a CPU code,


965
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:36,716
and you could also use V Image
or any number of other libraries


966
00:46:36,716 --> 00:46:37,516
that we have on the system.


967
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:39,866
So first things first.


968
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,516
We're going to get some
pointers back to our input data.


969
00:46:42,996 --> 00:46:45,596
So from the
CIImageProcessorInput we'll get


970
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:47,956
the base address,
and we'll make sure


971
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:50,586
that we use 8-bit
data, so UInt8.


972
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:52,816
And then we'll get
our outputPointer,


973
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:54,426
which is where we're going
to write all of our results


974
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,246
as float, because we specified


975
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,036
that we wanted to
write to RGBAf.


976
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:04,526
The next thing we do
is we make sure to deal


977
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:06,996
with the relative offsets of
our input and output image.


978
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:10,426
It's highly likely that
Core Image will provide you


979
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:13,386
with an input image that
is going to be larger,


980
00:47:13,386 --> 00:47:16,026
or at least not equivalent
to your output image,


981
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:19,016
so you have to take care of
whatever offset might be in play


982
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:22,126
when you're creating your output
image and doing your four loops.


983
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,046
And in this case,
once we have figured


984
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:27,276
out whatever offsets
we need, we can then go


985
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:30,226
and execute our four-loop to
calculate the output values


986
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:33,996
at location i, j by using
the input at location i, j,


987
00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:35,266
plus whatever offset we had.


988
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:41,426
Now that we've seen how to do
this with a custom CPU loop,


989
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:44,246
let's take a look at how
this can be done using Metal.


990
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:47,836
In this case we're going to be
using Metal Performance Shaders.


991
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:50,266
And there's a great
primitive inside


992
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,096
of Metal Performance Shaders


993
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:53,926
to compute integral images
called MPSImageIntegral.


994
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:59,176
From our CIImageProcessorOutput
we can get the commandBuffer,


995
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:02,266
the Metal command buffer, so we
just create an MPSImageIntegral


996
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:03,786
with that commandBuffer.


997
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,856
Once again we take care of
whatever offsets we may need


998
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:11,766
to deal with, and then we
simply encode that kernel


999
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,226
to the commandBuffer,
and providing


1000
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:16,186
as input the input
texture that we get


1001
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:17,466
from the CIImageProcessorInput,


1002
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:20,756
and as a destination
the output.MetalTexture.


1003
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:24,486
And this is how we can use
Metal very simply inside


1004
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,096
of an existing CIFilter graph.


1005
00:48:27,376 --> 00:48:29,336
So now let's take a look
at what we can actually do


1006
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:30,616
with this integral image
now that we have it.


1007
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:33,526
So let's say we start
with an image like this.


1008
00:48:33,686 --> 00:48:36,396
Our goal is going to be
to produce a new image


1009
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:40,706
where we have a per
pixel variable box blur.


1010
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:44,106
So each pixel in that image
can have a different amount


1011
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:44,966
of blur applied to it,


1012
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:48,576
and we can do this really
quickly using an integral image.


1013
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:53,626
So, as I was saying, box
blurs are very useful


1014
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,656
for doing very fast box sums.


1015
00:48:57,036 --> 00:48:58,896
So if we start right off with
this input image and we wanted


1016
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:02,336
to get the sum of those nine
pixels, traditionally speaking,


1017
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:04,116
this would require nine reads,


1018
00:49:04,606 --> 00:49:06,146
which means it's an
n squared problem.


1019
00:49:06,906 --> 00:49:10,056
That's obviously not
going to be very fast.


1020
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:12,706
That's not completely true.


1021
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,046
If you were a little
more smart about it,


1022
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,516
you could probably do this as
a multipass approach and do it


1023
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:18,706
in two n reads, but that
still means you're looking


1024
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,946
at six reads, and obviously
that doesn't scale very well.


1025
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:25,776
With an integral image,
however, we can just --


1026
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:29,596
if we want to get the sum of
those nine pixels, we just have


1027
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:30,776
to read at a few locations.


1028
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:35,316
We will read at the lower right
corner and then we can read


1029
00:49:35,716 --> 00:49:39,216
from just one pixel off to the
left, the sum of all the values,


1030
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,816
and subtract that from the
first value we just read.


1031
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,006
And then we read at a pixel
right above where we need to be


1032
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:49,036
and subtract the row which
corresponds to the sum


1033
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:50,276
of all the pixels
up to that stage.


1034
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:52,556
But now you can see we've
highlighted the upper left


1035
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,996
corner with a 1 because we've
subtracted that value twice,


1036
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:56,106
so we need to add it back in.


1037
00:49:57,556 --> 00:50:03,226
So what this means is we can
create an arbitrarily-sized box


1038
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:05,476
blur with just four reads.


1039
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:08,126

Thank you.

[ Applause ]


1043
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,216
If we were to actually do the
math manually, you could see


1044
00:50:15,216 --> 00:50:16,396
that these numbers do add up.


1045
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:19,796
So 2 plus 4 plus 6, et cetera,
is equal to the exact same thing


1046
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:22,926
as 66 minus 10 minus 13 plus 1.


1047
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:30,216
Now let's jump back into
Core Image kernel language


1048
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,996
and see how we can
use our integral image


1049
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,316
that we've computed
either with a CPU code


1050
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,076
or using the Metal
Performance Shader primitives


1051
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,336
and continue doing the work


1052
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,836
of actually creating
the box blur effect.


1053
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:42,956
So the first thing we're
going to do is we're going


1054
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,486
to compute our lower left corner


1055
00:50:44,486 --> 00:50:47,036
and upper right corner
from our image.


1056
00:50:47,036 --> 00:50:50,546
Those will tell us where we
need to subtract and add from.


1057
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:54,596
We're then going to compute
a few additional values


1058
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,816
and they're going to help us
determine what the alpha value


1059
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,446
should be, so how
transparent the pixel


1060
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,856
that we're currently
trying to produce is.


1061
00:51:01,956 --> 00:51:05,596
We take our four
samples, the four corners,


1062
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:10,786
and then finally we do our
additions and subtractions


1063
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:13,226
and multiply by what we've
decided is the appropriate


1064
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:15,576
amount of transparency
for this output pixel.


1065
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:22,056
Now, this particular kernel
takes a single parameter


1066
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:24,906
as an input radius, which
would mean that if you were


1067
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:25,906
to call this on an
image, you would get


1068
00:51:25,906 --> 00:51:28,386
that same radius applied
to the entire image,


1069
00:51:29,036 --> 00:51:33,836
but we can very simply go and
create a variable box blur


1070
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:37,396
by passing in a mask image,
and we can use this mask image


1071
00:51:37,446 --> 00:51:41,716
to determine how large
the radius should be


1072
00:51:41,716 --> 00:51:42,906
on a per pixel basis.


1073
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:46,836
So we just pass in an additional
parameter, mask image.


1074
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,186
We read from it.


1075
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,806
We take a look at what's in the
red channel, say, or it could be


1076
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:55,386
from any channel, and we then
multiply our radius by that.


1077
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,236
So if we had a radius
of 15 and at


1078
00:51:57,266 --> 00:51:59,406
that current pixel
location we had .5,


1079
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:01,506
it would give us
a radius of 7.5.


1080
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:04,856
We can then take those
values and pass it


1081
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,566
into the box blur kernel
that we just wrote.


1082
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:09,666
And this is how we can very
simply create a variable box


1083
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:13,236
blur using Metal
Performance Shaders


1084
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,796
and the CIImageProcessor nodes.


1085
00:52:18,316 --> 00:52:21,056
One additional thing we haven't
mentioned so far today is


1086
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:23,736
that we now have some
attributes you can specify


1087
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:28,426
on your CIKernels when you
write them and, in fact,


1088
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:31,316
we have this just one right
now, which is the output format.


1089
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:34,706
In this case we're
asking for RGBAf,


1090
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,306
which is not really
necessarily useful,


1091
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:40,946
but the key thing here is
that you can say that you'd


1092
00:52:41,046 --> 00:52:43,326
like to write only
single-channel


1093
00:52:43,636 --> 00:52:44,416
or two-channel data.


1094
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:44,966
So if you wanted to do --

[ Applause ]


1096
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:50,596
As some people have
noticed, this is a great way


1097
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:56,456
to reduce your memory usage,
and it's also a way to specify


1098
00:52:56,596 --> 00:53:00,156
that you want a certain
precision for a specific kernel


1099
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:02,256
in your graph that may
not correspond to the rest


1100
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:04,196
of the graph, which
is also what we do


1101
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,856
when we're processing
RAW images on iOS.


1102
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:10,646
All of our kernels
are tagged with RGBAh.


1103
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:16,206
So one or more thing we need
to do to create this effect is


1104
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:17,546
to provide some sort
of mask image.


1105
00:53:17,546 --> 00:53:20,956
We can do this very simply
by calling CIFilter(name,


1106
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:23,106
and then ask for
a CIRadialGradient


1107
00:53:23,136 --> 00:53:24,796
with a few parameters,
which are going


1108
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:28,126
to determine how
large the mask will be


1109
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:30,226
and where it will be located.


1110
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:33,066
And then we're going to be
interpolating between 0 and 1,


1111
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:34,106
which is going to
be black and white.


1112
00:53:34,106 --> 00:53:37,446
And then we ask for the
output image from the CIFilter


1113
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:39,916
and we have a perfectly
usable mask.


1114
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:44,916
So now let's take a look
at what this actually looks


1115
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,296
like when running on device,


1116
00:53:46,886 --> 00:53:50,076
and this is recorded
from an iPhone 6S.


1117
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:52,716
If we start with our input
image and then look at our mask,


1118
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:54,076
we can move it around.


1119
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:55,416
It's all very interactive.


1120
00:53:56,506 --> 00:53:59,516
Change the radius, even
make it go negative.


1121
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:05,136
And then if we apply this
mask image and use it inside


1122
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:08,516
of our variable box
blur kernel code,


1123
00:54:08,706 --> 00:54:10,696
we then get this type of result.


1124
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:12,366
And it's very interactive


1125
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,516
because the integral image
only needs to be computed once,


1126
00:54:15,576 --> 00:54:17,536
and Core Image caches
those results for you.


1127
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,096
So it literally, everything
you're seeing right now,


1128
00:54:20,096 --> 00:54:21,536
is just involving four reads.


1129

When you're using
the CIImageProcessor,

00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:39,706
if the data that you
would like to use inside

00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:41,376
of your image processor
is not inside


1135
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:45,456
of the context current
workingColorSpace, you're going


1136
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,546
to want to call
CIImage.byColorMatching

provide a color space.


1138
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:55,646
Similarly, on the way out,
if you would like the data


1139
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:56,726
in a different color space,


1140
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,306
you can call
CIImage.byColorMatching


1141
00:54:59,306 --> 00:55:02,126
ColorSpace(toWorking, and
then give it a color space.

Now that we've seen how to
create the CIImageProcessor


1143
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:13,416
and how to use it, let's
take a look at what happens


1144
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,206
when we use the environment
variable CI PRINT TREE,


1145
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:18,996
which we use to get an idea
of what the actual graph


1146
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,416
that we're trying to
render looks like.


1147
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:24,026
So this is what it looks


1148
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:26,686
like when you use the
environment variable CI PRINT


1149
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:27,816
TREE with the value
equal to the 1.


1150
00:55:27,936 --> 00:55:30,376
And this is read
from bottom to top.


1151
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:31,716
And it can be quite verbose.


1152
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:36,136
It starts off with our input
radialGradient that we created.


1153
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:38,106
We then have our input image


1154
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:41,326
which gets matched
to the workingspace.


1155
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:45,846
And then here's our processor
node that gets called,


1156
00:55:46,036 --> 00:55:49,466
and that hex value is the
digest that we've computed.


1157
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:53,526
And then both the processor
and the color kernel result


1158
00:55:53,526 --> 00:55:56,586
from the radialGradient get
fed into the variableBoxBlur.


1159
00:55:57,786 --> 00:56:02,266
And finally we do the color
matching to our output display.


1160
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:06,696
So this is the original
recipe that we use


1161
00:56:06,726 --> 00:56:11,286
to specify this effect, but it's
not what actually gets rendered.


1162
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:14,876
If we were to set the
environmental variable CI PRINT


1163
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:18,566
TREE to 8, we can now see that
many things have been collapsed


1164
00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:22,446
and the processing looks
to be less involved.


1165
00:56:23,766 --> 00:56:26,096
We still, once again,
have our processor node,


1166
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:28,066
which lives on a
line on its own,


1167
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:30,846
which means that it
does require the need


1168
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,386
of an intermediate buffer,


1169
00:56:32,386 --> 00:56:35,546
which is why the
CIImageProcessors are great,


1170
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:38,056
but you should only use them
when the kind of things --


1171
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:39,826
the effect that you're trying
to produce, the algorithms


1172
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:42,226
that you have cannot
be expressed inside


1173
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:43,316
of the CIKernel language.


1174
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:45,776
As you can see, the rest


1175
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:48,036
of the processing all
gets concatenated.


1176
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:50,276
So we have our variableBoxBlur
with the rest


1177
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:53,076
of the color matching, and
the clamptoalpha all happening


1178
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:53,946
in a single pass.


1179
00:56:54,616 --> 00:56:57,576
So this is why there are always
tradeoffs in between these APIs.


1180
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:00,066
And if you can write something
inside the CIKernel language,


1181
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:00,436
you should.


1182
00:57:03,106 --> 00:57:06,476
That may be a little
difficult to read.


1183
00:57:07,406 --> 00:57:09,966
So we have an additional
option now that you can specify


1184
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:11,896
when you're using CI PRINT
TREE, which is graphviz.


1185
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:16,306
In this case we're
using CI PRINT TREE=8,


1186
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:18,406
along with the graphviz option,


1187
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:21,606
and we can see our
processor node and how it fits


1188
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,956
in perfectly with the
rest of the graph.


1189
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:26,966
And we can also see that
we've asked for RGBAf output.


1190
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:33,686
So let's do a little recap
of what we learned today.


1191
00:57:34,356 --> 00:57:37,276
We saw, David showed us how
to edit RAW images on iOS.


1192
00:57:38,196 --> 00:57:39,166
Then Etienne spoke to us


1193
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:42,196
about how you can edit Live
Photos using Core Image.


1194
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:45,336
And then finally, we got to
see how to use this new API


1195
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:49,256
on CIImage called
CIImageProcessor, as well as how


1196
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:51,066
to specify an output
format on your kernels


1197
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,006
to help reduce the memory usage.


1198
00:57:53,706 --> 00:57:56,746
For additional information
please


1199
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:58,546
visit developer.apple.com.


1200
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:03,046
There are a few related sessions
that may be of interest to you,


1201
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:06,416
especially if you're planning
on doing RAW processing on iOS.


1202
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:07,916
There's Advances
in iOS Photography


1203
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,186
that Etienne mentioned as well.


1204
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:13,496
There's also a talk later on
today, Working with Wide Color,


1205
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:15,116
that's taking place right here.


1206
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,746
And on that note, I would like
to thank you all for coming.


1207
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,936
I hope you enjoy
the rest of WWDC.


1208
00:58:20,516 --> 00:58:30,760
