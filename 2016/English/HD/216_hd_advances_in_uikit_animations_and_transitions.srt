00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:30,686
>> Good afternoon.


4
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,746
My name is Bruce Nilo.


5
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:36,456
I'm an Engineering
Manager for UIKit.


6
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:41,566
And today, my coworker, Mike
Turner, and I are really excited


7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,706
to talk to you about
some new animation APIs


8
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:47,836
that we're introducing
to UIKit in iOS 10.


9
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:51,806
These APIs we're confident are
going to make it even easier


10
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,876
for you to create natural,
and smooth-feeling,


11
00:00:54,946 --> 00:01:00,046
and responsive applications.


12
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,596
So we're going to begin our talk
today with a quick refresher


13
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,366
of the existing implicit
animation APIs


14
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:09,836
that exist in UIKit.


15
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,006
We're then going to dive
into a brand new class


16
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,256
that we are introducing
called UIViewPropertyAnimator.


17
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,986
We're going to talk about
some extensions we've made


18
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,776
to view controller transitioning


19
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,886
so that you can take
advantage of this new class.


20
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,476
Mike is going to come
up and give a great demo


21
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,906
that uses these new APIs


22
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,446
and a brand new sample Photos
application that you'll be able


23
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,926
to download in the near future.


24
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,226
We're then going to talk about
a few subtle issues related


25
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,346
to touch processing and hit
testing for this new class


26
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:45,916
and how you can use
this new class


27
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,266
to create even interruptible
keyframe animations.


28
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:58,096
So, implicit property animations
in UIKit basically are there


29
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:02,736
to -- well, they exist
in a way that allows you


30
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,786
to create a dynamic context


31
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:08,306
by which you can update
the properties of a view


32
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,175
that can be animated over time.


33
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,766
It's an implicit API because
UIKit creates the animation


34
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,826
on your behalf.


35
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:23,066
It notes when the value changes
and uses the original value


36
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:28,186
and the end value to interpolate
the value over time based


37
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:32,156
on the duration that you specify
with an optional timing function


38
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,806
that specifies the
pacing of the animation.


39
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,006
So let's make this
a little concrete.


40
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:41,126
Here's a very simplified
animation.


41
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:45,056
We're going to use this
throughout the presentation.


42
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,836
We have a circle
that's basically going


43
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,036
from the left to the right.


44
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:51,686
It's the center property of
that view that's animating.


45
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:55,806
And when in this graph
we see a dotted circle


46
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,916
or a dotted square, it
means that's the value


47
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,876
that you're actually
seeing animate.


48
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:03,466
Whereas the solid shape is going
to indicate the target value.


49
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,436
And we sometimes call
that the model value


50
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,896
versus the presentation value.


51
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:12,696
So we start the animation,
and it proceeds a pace.


52
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:15,746
In fact, you'll notice that
the pacing was uniform.


53
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,536
And the question is -
how do we do that today?


54
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:20,366
Well, today it's really easy.


55
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:22,886
Most of you are probably
familiar


56
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,896
with the animateWithDuration
API.


57
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:30,256
And in this case, we're
specifying that the x coordinate


58
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:33,176
of the center of that circle
should move from 0 to 100.


59
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:39,466
Now the timing function that
was specified there was .linear,


60
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,956
which basically means it
was the identity function.


61
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,386
Now a quick review of what a
timing function is in UIKit.


62
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:52,236
It's basically a cubic function
that maps "0 to 1" to "0 to 1"


63
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:54,056
with a couple of constraints.


64
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,306
Namely, that at the
start of the animation --


65
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,586
meaning when you just started --


66
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,346
the progress of the value
that you're animating is


67
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,366
in fact the start value.


68
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,476
And at the end, it's
the end value.


69
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:12,186
Now timing functions that
are not identity pace


70
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,006
your animation.


71
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,516
And it's really easy to see this


72
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:19,136
with this exaggerated
ease-in timing function.


73
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,806
You'll notice that, halfway
through the animation,


74
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,636
the progress has barely moved.


75
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:28,716
It's really chugging
along pretty slowly.


76
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,396
We're almost 90%
of the way done.


77
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,376
We're still only halfway there.


78
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,966
It's in the last 10% of
the time that you specified


79
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,776
that we're going to make up
the rest of the distance.


80
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,756
Basically, this thing
is accelerating


81
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:46,776
from a very slow pace to a
high pace towards the end.


82
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,846
So that's what timing
functions give you.


83
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,386
UIKit currently really only
gives you four timing functions.


84
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,596
These are specific instances
of cubic Bézier functions.


85
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,766
There's the identity
function we saw before.


86
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,406
There's .easeInOut.


87
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,806
There is .easeIn.


88
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,636
And finally, there's .easeOut.


89
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:15,416
And these are very subtle
functions that we give you


90
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:19,046
to kind of affect the
feel of your animations.


91
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,426
Now what about springs?


92
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,966
We also have an implicit
animation API


93
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,996
where you can specify a spring.


94
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,096
And you wouldn't be
wrong if you said, "Well,


95
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,566
that's not really interpolating.


96
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,856
We're kind of overshooting
the value


97
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,186
and kind of bouncing back."


98
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,526
However, in what follows,
I'm going to encourage us all


99
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:43,876
to think about the spring as
another type of timing function.


100
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,106
And let's see why
we can do that.


101
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,986
Let's look at this
simple application


102
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:53,966
where we're animating a
square from left to right.


103
00:05:54,466 --> 00:06:00,046
And we're graphing effectively
the position of the square


104
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,666
as it proceeds over time.


105
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,466
And it kind of looks
like a timing function.


106
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,376
The thing is it's not a cubic.


107
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:09,876
It overshoots its values,
but we can still think of it


108
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,406
as affecting the
pacing of the animation.


109
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,036
And in the APIs that follow,
that's how we are going


110
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,866
to classify spring animations.


111
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:20,916
Now there is another
important edition that was made


112
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,796
to animations in iOS 8.


113
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:25,636
And I want to talk to you about
them because we're going to look


114
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,006
at them again a little
bit later.


115
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,486
Basically, consider an
animation that changes


116
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,356
in the midst of the animation.


117
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,166
So you're going from one
position to the other.


118
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,726
And halfway through,
you change it.


119
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,886
Now prior to iOS
8, if you did that,


120
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,896
there would be a discontinuity


121
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:46,666
in the animation unless you
specified a special option --


122
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,416
UIViewAnimationOption


123
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,546
BeginFromCurrentState.


124
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,946
And if you did that, it would
look a little bit better.


125
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,676
There wouldn't be a
discontinuity or a jump,


126
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,546
but it wouldn't be
smooth either.


127
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,056
The velocity changes
rather abruptly.


128
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:07,536
In iOS 8, we made a significant
change where animations


129
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:10,546
for certain properties
were done additively.


130
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:13,766
We didn't remove the previous
animation, we added to it.


131
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,386
And then that smoothed out
the change in velocity.


132
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,526
With the new
UIViewPropertyAnimator,


133
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,806
it's going to be impossible to
get into the first situation.


134
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,706
OK, let's get to
the new class now


135
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,986
that we have done
the quick refresh.


136
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:32,796
Some of its features.


137
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:33,786
It's really familiar.


138
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:37,316
If you're familiar with the
existing animateWithDuration


139
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:41,626
suite of APIs, you'll be right
at home with this new API.


140
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,586
It's interruptible.


141
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:46,196
That means you can pause
and stop the animations.


142
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:50,656
You can scrub them, meaning you
can move forward-to-back as you


143
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,376
like based on a programmatic
API.


144
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:55,326
You can reverse them.


145
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,936
You can say, "Never mind.


146
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:57,786
Go backwards."


147
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,596
We're going to introduce
a whole new plethora


148
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,856
of timing functions, not just
the four that we had before


149
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:08,766
with one kind of small
subset of spring animations.


150
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,466
And finally, when the
animations are running,


151
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:15,166
it'll be really easy to add
to the running animations.


152
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:21,906
So it's kind of hard to talk
about API, and I don't want


153
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,986
to do it by going into
kind of a header crawl.


154
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,116
So let's get an overview of
what this API looks like.


155
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,386
At the center of it all
is this new class --


156
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,796
UIViewPropertyAnimator.


157
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,426
It's implemented in terms
of two new protocols.


158
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:41,076
And the reason for implementing
them as protocols or conforming


159
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,966
to two new protocols we'll
see is really powerful


160
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,286
when we couple it with view
controller transitions.


161
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,946
When you create a property
animator, you're going


162
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,716
to create a new type of object


163
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,886
which is effectively
specifying the timing function


164
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,416
that you want that
animation to use.


165
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:00,176
We provide two new
concrete classes for these.


166
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:04,556
We've introduced a couple of
new enumerations that are used


167
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:07,766
by the methods defined
in these protocols.


168
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:08,876
For example, the state


169
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:12,846
of an animator can be
inactive, active, or stopped.


170
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,726
And we're going to be talking
about that momentarily.


171
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,966
We also introduced a
position, which basically is


172
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,956
where did the animation finish.


173
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,876
Did it go all the way to the
target values that we specified?


174
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,936
Did we reverse it and go
back to the beginning?


175
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:31,006
Or maybe we interrupted it
and we're somewhere else.


176
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:36,036
OK. We're going to
start focusing


177
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,856
on the center part
of this graph.


178
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:39,986
We're then going to
talk a little bit


179
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,906
about all these new
timing functions.


180
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:47,516
So let's look at kind of
the corner piece of the API


181
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,776
which is defined by the
UIViewAnimating protocol.


182
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:51,886
This is where all the fun is.


183
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:53,536
It's really simple actually.


184
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,616
There's a couple of properties
that you can observe and set.


185
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,636
For example, you can set
the fractionComplete.


186
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,536
You can tell an animation
to start.


187
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:03,336
You can pause it,
stop it, finish it.


188
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,846
It's kind of self-explanatory.


189
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,766
The next protocol adds the
implicit characteristics


190
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,786
to this animator.


191
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:14,456
It's where you add blocks
where you set the target values


192
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,896
of the properties that
you wish to animate.


193
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:21,736
There's also an interesting
method called continueAnimation


194
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:24,926
which allows you to proceed
from a paused animation


195
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:28,306
with a completely
different finish duration,


196
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,016
and possibly even a
different timing function.


197
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,316
UIViewPropertyAnimator has
a couple of constructers.


198
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,386
It also has some properties
that control the touch handling


199
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,566
that we're going to get into
at the end of this talk.


200
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:48,956
So we're going to talk first
about how to use this -- basics.


201
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,576
We're going to talk about some
details that perhaps are not


202
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,946
so obvious that you might
encounter when you pause


203
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,546
and scrub an animation.


204
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,716
There's also some interesting
possibilities in terms


205
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:00,416
of how you can reverse
an animation.


206
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,086
Finally, we're going


207
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,086
to introduce all the
timing providers.


208
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:09,306
So let's start a
really simple animation.


209
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,406
And I've made this one a
little bit more interesting


210
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,576
for pedagogical reasons
that you'll see soon.


211
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,936
And let's ask the question,


212
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,456
"How would you use the
property animator to do this?"


213
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,356
And it's really, really easy.


214
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,046
The first thing you do is
you create a timing object.


215
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:31,596
This is just like the .easeInOut
enumerations you've used


216
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:32,526
in the existing API.


217
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:37,386
You instantiate one of these
objects by specifying a duration


218
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,246
and the timing object.


219
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:43,396
You add animations
in terms of closures,


220
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:46,216
which are updating properties
that you want to animate.


221
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,576
You can add an optional
completion.


222
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:52,156
In this case, that completion
is changing the color back


223
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:52,836
to orange.


224
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,276
And then you can start
it whenever you want to.


225
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:00,006
OK, it's kind of verbose
compared to the old API,


226
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,986
but now you have an
object and there's all kind


227
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,116
of things you can do with it.


228
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,076
It makes a world of difference.


229
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:12,226
So let's look at some of the
properties that are available


230
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,686
in UIViewPropertyAnimator.


231
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:15,416
There's three that
are quite interesting.


232
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,746
There's the state, there's
whether it's running or not,


233
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,116
and whether it is running in the
forward or reverse direction.


234
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,856
These are observable properties
in the KVO sense of the word.


235
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:28,096
Now the first thing you do
is you add an animation.


236
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,696
We're going to animate the
circle again from left to right.


237
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,876
Once you do and you've
added an animation closure,


238
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,046
you can start the animation.


239
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,846
The second you start
the animation,


240
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,906
the state changes,
it starts running.


241
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:45,016
The values of the
actual views change now.


242
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,466
There is target value


243
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,046
and there's what you
see on the screen.


244
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,726
And then the animation starts.


245
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,266
Now what's different
now is I can pause


246
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,076
that animation halfway through.


247
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:58,246
And to do that, I just
tell the animator to pause.


248
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,506
I can tell it that I
want it to continue again


249
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,786
in the opposite direction.


250
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,916
I'm still paused when
I do, and you'll notice


251
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,076
that the states change.


252
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:09,286
And then I can start
it, and it's going


253
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,026
to start going backwards.


254
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:15,506
And then I can change it again,
and it's going to go forwards.


255
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,426
And when it completes,


256
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,146
we're going to call
any completion handlers


257
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,006
that you've registered.


258
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:24,376
And in this time, we're
calling it with a .end position


259
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,866
because we made it all the
way to the initial target.


260
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,476
If we hadn't reversed it
again while it was running,


261
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:33,166
we would have called the
completion with a .start.


262
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:34,966
That way, your completion
handler knows


263
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,576
where the animation
actually ended.


264
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:42,196
OK. Instead of pausing
an animation,


265
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,386
there's something
really neat you can do.


266
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,306
You can stop the animation.


267
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,326
Now what does that mean?


268
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,256
Well, the first thing you'll
notice is that, all of a sudden,


269
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,186
that circle became
solid in the center.


270
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:57,336
We've effectively promoted what
you're seeing on the screen


271
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:01,126
to the actual model value that's
in the view that's animating.


272
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:03,466
At that point, you can
do anything you want


273
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,236
with that circle.


274
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,786
But we passed in a
false parameter to stop,


275
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,536
which means don't
jump immediately


276
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,596
to the inactive states, stay
in this quasi-finish state.


277
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:16,116
And what that means is that,
at some point in the future,


278
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:18,986
you're going to call
finishAnimation and you're going


279
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:23,886
to specify a position where the
animation is in fact finishing.


280
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,716
In this case, we're
not finishing neither


281
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,736
at the end or at the beginning.


282
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,306
And you're completion
handlers will be called


283
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,156
with that position.


284
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,396
Now if you called stopAnimation
with a true parameter,


285
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,546
we wouldn't even call
your completion handler.


286
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,596
It's just finished
right then and there.


287
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,476
Now let's look at what happens


288
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,656
if you call
finishWithADifferentPosition.


289
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,756
Let's say we call
finishWithTheEnd.


290
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:51,416
It immediately jumps to
where the animation was


291
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,856
originally targeted.


292
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,206
Now you might think, "Why
would I want to do that?"


293
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,966
And it actually gives you
a lot of possibilities.


294
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,026
For example, imagine
you're pausing this circle


295
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,756
or you're stopping this
circle when you touch it,


296
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,936
and then you're dragging
the circle around.


297
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,896
And maybe you set up
some UIKit snap behaviors


298
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:14,296
in the end position and
the target position.


299
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,726
And when you release it, based
on the velocity of your gesture,


300
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,376
it may snap into those
relative positions.


301
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,566
And once it reaches that, you
can then call finishAnimation


302
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,746
with a .end or .begin.


303
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,656
And so you can do some
interesting things


304
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:30,766
to finalize the animations
that you've started.


305
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:39,876
[ Applause ]


306
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,606
OK, pausing and scrubbing.


307
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:44,856
Not much there, right?


308
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,006
Well, it's kind of interesting.


309
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:50,506
So there's a sample app here
which we are going to --


310
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,246
where we set some gesture
recognizers on the square and on


311
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,036
that little green progress bar.


312
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:00,646
And we can scrub
that progress bar.


313
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:03,186
We're updating where
the square is.


314
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,996
And then we can continue
the square.


315
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:09,886
And you'll notice that kind
of the position over time --


316
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,326
there's kind of a weird
protuberance in that graph,


317
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,056
which we're going
to talk to in a bit.


318
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,746
Before we do that, let's look


319
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,586
at what these gesture
recognizers look like.


320
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,926
On the square, we added
a tap gesture recognizer


321
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,736
which checks whether or not
the animation is active.


322
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:28,146
And if it is, it checks is
it running or not running.


323
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,216
And if it's running,
it's going to pause it.


324
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,356
And if it's not, it's
going to start it up again.


325
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:33,776
Pretty straightforward.


326
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:38,696
On the progress bar, we set
up a pan gesture recognizer.


327
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,916
And we're going to just compute
a fraction based on the position


328
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,676
where we are in the pan relative


329
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:50,326
to the full bounds
of that progress bar.


330
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,346
And based on that fraction
that we've computed,


331
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,576
we're going to update
both the animator


332
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,826
and the progress bar
as fractionComplete.


333
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:07,806
OK. So, what's going
on with this graph?


334
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,976
There's actually something
interesting going on here.

[ Laughter ]


336
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:17,226
And to explain what, I'm
going to go back to this kind


337
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,566
of exaggerated ease-in
curve again.


338
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,086
So let's say this time,
50% of the way in,


339
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,776
we pause the animation and
now we want to scrub it.


340
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:31,856
The important thing to note
is that the fractionComplete


341
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:35,476
that you're actually setting
has nothing to do with time.


342
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,186
We've just paused the animation.


343
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:40,296
What you're really
setting is the fraction


344
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,636
of progress towards
the end value.


345
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:46,156
And in this case, we've hardly
made any progress at all.


346
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,396
Now we're going to scrub
that line and we're going


347
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:50,636
to want to continue it again.


348
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:56,236
We don't want to jump
the perceived position


349
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,346
of the view that
we're animating.


350
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:02,276
So, in fact, what happens
is we kind of map time back


351
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:04,596
to the timing function of
the original animation.


352
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:08,946
Which means when we continue
in this particular case,


353
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,846
the animation is going
to finish really quickly.


354
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:16,226
So when we go back to the curve
that we actually saw before,


355
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,366
you'll notice that we're
kind of jumping back


356
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:22,176
onto the timing function
-- that easeInOut function.


357
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,746
And it's important to note
that when you're pausing


358
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,076
and scrubbing, depending


359
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:29,316
on whatever UI affordance
you may be using to do this,


360
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,476
you may see these
discontinuities and have to kind


361
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,846
of compensate for them.


362
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,776
OK, let's talk a little
bit about reversing.


363
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,906
There's three ways
you can reverse.


364
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:46,526
One is you can pause reverse --
kind of interact with something


365
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:48,086
and start it up again.


366
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:52,766
And you'll notice that you're
literally reversing right back


367
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,406
through the timing function
that you've specified.


368
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,566
You can also reverse on the fly.


369
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:00,096
Which means that, as the
animation is running,


370
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,286
you can tell it to reverse.


371
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,386
And that's kind of like
hitting a brick wall.


372
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:07,086
Again, there's going to be this
huge discontinuity in velocity.


373
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,446
And that might be what you
want if you want to kind


374
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:14,416
of represent, say, a
perfectly-inelastic collision


375
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,396
or something like that.


376
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,946
But if you don't want that and
you want it to be smoother,


377
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,206
you can animate additively.


378
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:25,406
And in this case, we will
reverse the animation not


379
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:28,046
by changing the reverse
property, but we're going


380
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:31,896
to actually change the values
back to the original values.


381
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,796
Now what's different
about this is


382
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,746
that when your completion
handlers are called,


383
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,986
they're going to be called
with a position of .end.


384
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:41,156
You've basically
changed the target.


385
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:45,756
You're no longer going
towards the original target.


386
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:50,176
You're going back towards the
target you just specified.


387
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:57,126
OK, there's some
interesting timing objects


388
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,476
that we've made available
to you.


389
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:05,726
The first is the
UICubicTimingParameter class.


390
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,556
If you create this class with
no parameters, you're going


391
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:11,916
to get the default core
animation timing curve.


392
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,836
This was previously
unavailable at the UIKit level.


393
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,766
The second variant


394
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:21,916
of the constructor is
essentially the existing canned


395
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,426
animation curves.


396
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,216
And finally, we opened up all


397
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:27,486
of the cubic Bézier
curves available


398
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,826
on the unit square to you.


399
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:32,426
And as an example of
something that you might do --


400
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,026
this particular Bézier curve,
if I were to give it a name,


401
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,726
it would be "speed
in, speed out".


402
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:39,826
And you can kind of go wild
with the Bézier curves you want


403
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,976
to create for timing functions.

[ Applause ]


405
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:52,116
We've given you more ways
to animate like a spring.


406
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,596
And, again, consider that
we consider springs now


407
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,646
to be influencing the timing.


408
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,636
If you create a
UISpringTimingParameter object


409
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:01,556
with no arguments, you're going


410
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:03,946
to get a critically-damped
spring animation,


411
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,426
which many of you
have asked for.


412
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:09,256
It's one that we use, for
example, when we push or pop


413
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:10,946
onto a navigation controller.

[ Applause ]


415
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,756
The second variant
is very similar


416
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:22,316
to the existing UIKit
spring animation API


417
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:25,046
with a small difference that
I'm going to get to in a second.


418
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:28,276
But before we get to
that, we've opened


419
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:30,386
up basically the
spring equation to you.


420
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:33,746
You can specify any
coefficients you want,


421
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:36,846
and we will effectively
honor those.


422
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:40,446
There's a point here though, and
that is that the duration now


423
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,616
that you specify is ignored.


424
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:47,006
And we're computing that
duration based on the solution


425
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,026
of the spring equation.


426
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:49,826
You're going to see
an example of that.

[ Applause ]


428
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,016
I said there was a difference.


429
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,266
You'll notice that the initial
velocity is now a vector.


430
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,736
It's not a scaler.


431
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:03,076
Most of the time, we're
actually not going to look


432
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,946
at the y component
of this vector.


433
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:09,566
However, if you are animating
the center of a view,


434
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:11,856
we're actually going
to look at both the x


435
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,086
and y components of that vector.


436
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:16,896
And to see why, look at
this example application


437
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,736
where we drag a square
off the center.


438
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,336
And when we release it,
we're going to spring back


439
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,836
to the center based on the
velocity of the gesture.


440
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:31,496
Now, up until now, the velocity
was always along the line


441
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:34,946
connecting those two squares,
which was kind of unfortunate


442
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:38,366
because my gesture might be
released anywhere along the


443
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,186
plane, and we effectively
really weren't taking


444
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,066
that into account.


445
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,496
However, now we are.


446
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,296
So let's look at
this little video


447
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:50,576
which shows how we now will
spring back to the center


448
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:54,516
and take into account the
two-dimensional vector position.


449
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,376
You'll notice that,
when we go off,


450
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,656
we're going to take both
the x and y components.


451
00:22:58,906 --> 00:22:59,916
It's really easy to do that.

And guess what?


455
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:11,906

456
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:14,126
for custom view controller
transitions.

00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,546
I want them to be
interruptible, too.


458
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:21,476
Now, three years ago or so,
I gave a whole talk on this,


459
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,166
and so it's a little
bit complicated.


460
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,896
So if you're not familiar


461
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,646
with custom view
controller transitions,


462
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,476
please refer to that talk.


463
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:32,656
But I'm going to give a quick
run-through to set the stage


464
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,986
of how we've extended
these protocols.


465
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:37,806
View controller transitions
basically are a bunch


466
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,166
of interlocking protocols --


467
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,776
two of which interactive
transitioning


468
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,446
and animated transitioning
are protocols


469
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,886
that you create objects
which you conform to --


470
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:49,576
well, the objects that
you create conform to.


471
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,966
The system will create
another object that gets passed


472
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,186
into the methods
of that protocol.


473
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:58,776
And this will become
clear in a second.


474
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,486
But let's remember why
we want to do this.


475
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:04,556
Imagine you have an app
with a navigation controller


476
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:08,286
and the pop kind of looks OK.


477
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:09,026
It's that great,


478
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:11,856
critically-damped
spring animation.


479
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,326
But, you know, your app
wants something else.


480
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:18,736
Your app wants to really kind
of have a different look --


481
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,806
something that explodes
out maybe


482
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,346
with a blur effect underneath.


483
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:25,186
That's what custom view
controller transitions let


484
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:25,706
you do.


485
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,796
And moreover, it
lets you do those


486
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:29,316
and drive those interactively.


487
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:33,536
OK. The way we get the
objects that conform


488
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,426
to these protocols are
just via a delegate.


489
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:37,796
It might be the navigation
controller delegate,


490
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,286
or it might be a
view controller's


491
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,516
transitioning delegate.


492
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,126
And we're going to ask that
delegate, "Do you have an object


493
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,936
that conforms to animated
transitioning whenever you do a


494
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,036
present, or a push, or a pop?


495
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:53,216
And if you do, we're going to
bypass the built-in transition.


496
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,556
We're going to create one


497
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,646
of these context
transitioning objects


498
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,806
which give you all the
information you need


499
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,876
to actually animate
a transition.


500
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,196
And we're going to
call animateTransition,


501
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,216
passing in that context to you."


502
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,556
Now how do we make
it interruptible?


503
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:12,146
Well, what we've done is we've
added a new optional method


504
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:14,466
called
interruptibleAnimator(using.


505
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,306
And if you implement that,
you're going to return an object


506
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:20,826
that conforms to
UIViewImplicitlyAnimating.


507
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,456
Now this could be a
UIViewPropertyAnimator,


508
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:24,936
but it doesn't need to be.


509
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:28,376
It could be, for example,
another type of animator that,


510
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,776
say, you implement in
terms of UIKit dynamics


511
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:33,996
or some other animation
strategy.


512
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:41,676
If you do not implement
the interaction controller,


513
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:44,906
meaning you only implement a
custom animation controller,


514
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:47,036
then you need to
implement animateTransition.


515
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:50,976
And you would do so very
simply, like this method.


516
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,186
You take the interruptible
animator that you would return


517
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:56,306
and you would basically
tell it to start.


518
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,186
And that's really
all you need to do


519
00:25:58,186 --> 00:25:59,726
to implement animateTransition.


520
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,056
However, we kind of advise


521
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:05,436
that you use an interaction
controller if you're going


522
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:06,646
to make it interruptible.


523
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,966
And, again, the first thing
you have to do is conform to


524
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,456
or return an object
that conforms


525
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,946
to animated transitioning.


526
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:18,306
We will then ask you for
an object that conforms


527
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:19,906
to interactive transitioning.


528
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,796
And we're going to pass the
object that you return back


529
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:24,966
to us previously as a parameter.


530
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:29,626
Often times, you want that
interaction controller


531
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:32,856
to actually drive the
animation controller.


532
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:38,956
If you do, we're not going
to call animateTransition.


533
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:41,186
We're going to call
startInteractiveTransition


534
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:43,016
and we're going to pass
in the same context


535
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:45,306
that we would have passed
into animateTransition.


536
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,716
We provide a concrete
class that you can use


537
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,516
that makes this really easy.


538
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:57,146
Now there was a restriction
before


539
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,866
where if you implemented
UIPercentDriven


540
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,876
InteractiveTransition,


541
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:04,216
you actually needed the
animateTransition method


542
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:07,716
of the animation controller to
have been implemented in terms


543
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:10,566
of the existing UIKit
animation APIs.


544
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:15,896
But now with the interruptible
animator, UIPercentDriven


545
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:18,406
InteractiveTransition actually
doesn't care about that.


546
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,936
It's just using the
protocol that we've defined


547
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:24,016
in UIViewImplicitlyAnimating.


548
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:25,786
And that's it.


549
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:28,016
So you could actually have a
completely different animation


550
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,696
that's driven by UIPercentDriven


551
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:33,746
InteractiveTransition,
which is kind of cool.


552
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,566
OK, let's say you already
have one of these things,


553
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,066
you already have a
custom transition.


554
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:38,876
How do you migrate?


555
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:42,626
Well, one way to do it would
literally be rename your


556
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:46,006
animateTransition method
to myAnimateTransition


557
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,286
and build your interruptible
animator in such a way


558
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:52,866
that you just add that
method call into one


559
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:56,276
of the animations
of the animator.


560
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,706
Not too difficult.


561
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:04,826
We did have to extend some other
objects in these protocols.


562
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:07,096
For example, context
transitioning now has


563
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,766
a pauseInteractiveTransition.


564
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:13,186
That's how you enter into
the interactive state now.


565
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:16,116
Prior to this, you
started interactive


566
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:18,006
and you ended non-interactive.


567
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,776
Now, you can move
back and forth.


568
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:21,336
And the way you do that is


569
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:27,276
by calling pauseInteractive,
or finish, or cancel.


570
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:30,556
Also, the property
values isInteractive


571
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:34,266
and transitionWasCancelled can
now change as you move back


572
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:37,776
and forth between an interactive
and non-interactive transition.


573
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:42,916
We added a variable called
wantsInteractiveStart.


574
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,936
Because now that you
can move and forth,


575
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,766
maybe you want your
interaction controller to start


576
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,646
out non-interactively.


577
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:52,246
And this variable
controls that behavior.


578
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:57,246
Finally, we have UIPercentDriven


579
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,156
InteractiveTransition updated.


580
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,396
There are a few rules.


581
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:05,086
interruptibleAnimator
-- if you implement it,


582
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,776
we expect it to actually
be there.


583
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,796
Meaning don't do something else.


584
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:11,076
The system might get grumpy.


585
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,136
We're always going to
call animateTransition


586
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,096
and startInteractiveTransition
first.


587
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,506
So that would be a great place


588
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,776
to create your interruptible
animator because we are going


589
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,416
to be calling it subsequently
with the same context,


590
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,666
and we expect the same
instance of animator


591
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,166
to always be returned.


592
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:32,266
Finally, the animator survives
the life of the transition.


593
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,936
It shouldn't become inactive


594
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,456
until the entire
transition is over.


595
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,936
Now, Mike is going to
come up and show you how


596
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,696
to use these APIs in a real app.


597
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:43,936
I didn't give you much time.


598
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:50,066
[ Applause ]


599
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,286
>> Thanks, Bruce.


600
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:53,526
All right.


601
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:57,376
So, let's start with a
demo application here.


602
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,776
We've got an application


603
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:02,846
that utilizes the
UIViewPropertyAnimator


604
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:05,576
and the additions to
UIViewController transitioning


605
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:09,346
to create a nice
interruptible custom transition


606
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:10,136
in a basic app.


607
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,266
So, first, we have
an application


608
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,896
that uses a
UINavigationController


609
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,966
and has a Collection View
Controller inside of it.


610
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,946
And we have this grid of
photos we can scroll through.


611
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,896
When we tap one of the photos,


612
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,166
it will push another view
controller on the navstack.


613
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:25,166
And that kind of
shows a detailed view


614
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:25,846
of your photos here.


615
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,586
And if we hit the Back button,
we'll pop that off the navstack.


616
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:31,966
And alternatively, we can slide
from the left edge of the screen


617
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,276
to do an interactive
transition back.


618
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,476
And this is all available
basically for free


619
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:37,696
in UINavigationController.


620
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,526
And as Bruce just described,
we also have a rich set of APIs


621
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,916
that allow you to
customize that transition.


622
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,316
And, here, if we want the
photo to kind of zoom up out


623
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,536
of the page, we can do
that, which is pretty cool.


624
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,426
When we hit the Back
button, it'll zoom back down.


625
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,316
And this was all
possible before.


626
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:55,576
In addition to that,
you could pull


627
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:58,916
down to start the transition
interactively, move around,


628
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:01,116
and then let it finish
in an animated fashion.


629
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,556
So I want to show you
how we've accomplished


630
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:05,576
that using
UIViewPropertyAnimator.


631
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,476
OK, so the first thing you need
to do is tell the system --


632
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:16,906
in this case, the
navigation controller --


633
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:19,916
that you're going to be
providing a custom transition.


634
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,266
So, here, we're going to conform


635
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,496
to the navigation controller's
delegate, and we'll do


636
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:25,586
so with an
AssetTransitionController.


637
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,736
And that's just an object we've
created that'll implement these


638
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,796
transition protocols.


639
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,736
So, here, we have two methods
that are pretty important.


640
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:34,966
The first is calling us
for an animation controller


641
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,466
with a particular
operation -- a push or a pop.


642
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:40,186
We'll save that operation
and we'll return ourselves


643
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,636
since we're going to be
the animation controller.


644
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:44,636
And then when we return
an object from that API,


645
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:47,406
the system will call us for
an interaction controller,


646
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,616
at which point we'll also return
ourselves because we're going


647
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,966
to be the interaction
controller as well.


648
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,656
And once we've done that, the
system knows that this is going


649
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:55,916
to be an interactive transition.


650
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:58,996
So let's look at
UIViewController


651
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:00,046
InteractiveTransitioning.


652
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:04,116
Here, the system is going to
call startInteractiveTransition


653
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,826
on our object with a
transition context,


654
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,436
and that'll have all the
pertinent information


655
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:11,166
that you'll need to start
your custom transition.


656
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,426
And at this point, we're going
to create a helper object here


657
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:16,716
that we'll see a little
bit more of in a moment.


658
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,236
But that's the object
that's going


659
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,536
to create our transition
animator.


660
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:23,456
And we're going to pass the
context to the operation


661
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,126
that we saved


662
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,826
and a panGestureRecognizer
we were using to start


663
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:28,036
that transition interactively.


664
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:32,496
In iOS 10, we also allow you to
start an interactive transition


665
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,466
in two phases -- either
an animation phase


666
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,646
or the interactive phase.


667
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,256
So if we did start from
a panGestureRecognizer,


668
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,026
we're going to set this
initiallyInteractive ivar here


669
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,066
to "true" to let the system know


670
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,386
that we're starting
this interactive


671
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,836
transition interactively.


672
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,826
And next, let's look


673
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:51,486
at the animated transitioning
implementation.


674
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,006
Here, we're not really concerned
about the animation methods.


675
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,676
As Bruce mentioned, we're using
an interaction controller,


676
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,746
and that's going to call
startInteractiveTransition


677
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,216
as opposed to animateTransition.


678
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:03,906
But the new interruptible
animator API


679
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:06,146
in iOS 10 is what we're
really interested in here.


680
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,506
And, here, our helper
object that we'll see


681
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:11,756
in just a second creates
a UIViewPropertyAnimator


682
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,456
and returns that for
us to the system.


683
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,806
So, that's where
the system is going


684
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,456
to add any alongside animations.


685
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:20,966
And in this demo, you'll see the
navigation bar at the top kind


686
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,556
of animating along
with our transition.


687
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,486
The system is going to take
advantage of this animator


688
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,036
to add those animations.


689
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,226
So let's look at the
transition driver helper object


690
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:29,646
really quick.


691
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:31,806
All right.


692
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,066
Here, you saw that we
initialized this object


693
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,386
in startInteractiveTransition.


694
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:40,036
And that's going to call
through -- excuse me.


695
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:40,936
There we go.


696
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:44,096
That's going to call
through to this helper method


697
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,006
with some animations, and
it's going to set up some


698
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:47,996
of the background
animations for the transition.


699
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:50,246
You saw visual effect
was animating.


700
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,406
And the two view controllers,
alpha, was kind of animating.


701
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:56,186
We'll talk about the image
changing its frame a little


702
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:56,606
later on.


703
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:00,096
And it'll pass in a completion
closure as well to help clean


704
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:01,396
up some of those
background views.


705
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:04,236
But, here, let's focus on how
we create that property animator


706
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:06,236
that we returned to the
interruptibleAnimator API.


707
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,596
So we first get a transition
duration from a helper function,


708
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:10,936
and we'll look at that
in a second as well.


709
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:13,966
And we're going to create this
PropertyAnimator with a duration


710
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:15,306
and a curve of .easeOut.


711
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,106
And we'll pass in those
animations that we were given.


712
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:20,406
And we'll create a
completion handler here,


713
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:23,806
and we'll call those completions
that were passed to us.


714
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,376
But the important thing
here is we're going to call


715
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,985
to the transition context
when this animator ends


716
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,636
to inform the system that, "Hey,


717
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,096
we're done with this
transition."


718
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,436
And we can get where we're --


719
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:34,206
I'm sorry,


720
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,446
the completionTransition
API takes a bool


721
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:39,966
that we can get the value that
we're supposed to pass through.


722
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:41,936
So we pass "yes" to that API.


723
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:44,025
That means we're going
to end the transition.


724
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:46,335
If we pass "no", it means we're
going to cancel the transition.


725
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,755
So before I go a
little bit further


726
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,505
in the transition animator
helper object here,


727
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,976
I want to show you a few
more features in the demo app


728
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,976
that are made possible by
using UIViewPropertyAnimator.


729
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,936
So if we go back to the demo,
I showed you that you can zoom


730
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,866
out of the screen and zoom back
in hitting the Back button.


731
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:11,806
But what I didn't show you is
you can pause now midflight.


732
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:14,896
So we're in the animation
phase, we pause the animation,


733
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,636
and we move into an
interactive phase.


734
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,426
So we're interacting
with this photo


735
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:19,336
in the middle of
this transition.


736
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:21,476
When we release our finger,
they'll kind of animate again,


737
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:22,826
and then we can interrupt
it again.


738
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:25,906
So we're free to move back and
forth between an animation phase


739
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,076
and an interactive
phase of the transition.


740
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,416
So it's really pretty cool.


741
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:33,376
So before I go back to the
code and show how we've done


742
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,826
that using the new
view controller APIs,


743
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:38,426
I want to describe a particular
scenario here that'll help us


744
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,856
understand what the code
is going to be doing.


745
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,916
So imagine we're starting.


746
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,066
We're pulling down with the
panGestureRecognizer here,


747
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,576
starting an interactive
transition.


748
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:48,186
And then we're going to release
our finger from the screen


749
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:50,666
and start an animation phase,
and while it's animating,


750
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:53,036
we're going to pause
midflight and we're going


751
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:53,876
to interact with it again.


752
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,296
And we're going to
cancel that transition


753
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:56,266
by pulling it back up.


754
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,836
So that's the scenario that
we're going to describe


755
00:35:58,836 --> 00:35:59,976
when we look at this
next piece of code.


756
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,176
So I've broken that down in
this sample application here


757
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,496
in terms of four methods.


758
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:12,036
The updateInteraction, which is
the gesture recognizer handler


759
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,796
that's going to update the
interactive transition.


760
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,166
And when our finger lifts,


761
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,276
we're going to call the
endInteraction function.


762
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:21,086
And then we're going to call
the animate function to animate


763
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,566
to either the begin
or end position.


764
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:25,146
And then when we
interrupt that animation,


765
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,006
we'll end up calling
pauseAnimation.


766
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:29,976
So we can do this
loop a few times


767
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,546
in the lifetime of a transition.


768
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,446
We can actually do it as
many times as we'd like.


769
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,116
But in this scenario,
we did it twice.


770
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,666
So we look at updateInteraction.


771
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,756
This is a gesture
recognizer handler.


772
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:43,196
And when it's called in "state
begin" or "state change",


773
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,656
we're going to look
at the translation


774
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:46,546
of the gesture recognizer
and we're going to use


775
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:48,986
that to compute a progress
step that we're going to add


776
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,086
to the transition animator
as fractionComplete.


777
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:54,746
And then to scrub those
animations in the background --


778
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,286
you saw the navbar in some of
our chrome, the visual effect


779
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,726
in the background
-- it's as simple


780
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,016
as setting the fractionComplete
on this transition animator.


781
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:04,426
And that'll let us scrub through
all these animations basically


782
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:04,836
for free.


783
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,366
And then we'll call to
the transitionContext


784
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,536
to update the interactive
transitions percentComplete.


785
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:11,166
And then, finally, we have


786
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,756
that image that's
moving around screen.


787
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:15,066
When we're in the interactive
phase of this transition,


788
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,166
we're going to handle
setting that frame manually.


789
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,906
So we have a little helper
function here to do that.


790
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:22,366
And finally, we'll
reset the translation


791
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,316
on this gesture recognizer.


792
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:26,666
So when we're called, when the
finger lifts off the screen,


793
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,876
we'll get a "state ended"
on the gesture recognizer


794
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,166
and we'll call endInteraction.


795
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,346
If we look at endInteraction,


796
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:35,696
we first just check is our
transition context interactive.


797
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:37,816
And we want to make sure
it is before we move it


798
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:38,956
out of the interactive phase.


799
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:41,066
And we'll call a
little helper function


800
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:42,966
that tells us whether
we're going to complete


801
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,606
in the begin position of the
animation or the end position.


802
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,136
If we're completing in the
end position, then we're going


803
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,536
to call to the context
to say, "Hey,


804
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:51,496
we're finishing the
interactive transition here.


805
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,296
We're going to move to
an animation phase."


806
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:55,776
If we're called with
the begin position,


807
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,766
we're going to say we're
cancelling the interactive phase


808
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,356
and we're going to move
to the animated phase.


809
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,566
And then we just animate.


810
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,526
So let's look at the
animation method here.


811
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:05,966
So, previously, I told you


812
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,766
that the transition
animator animates kind


813
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:10,806
of the background chrome
and the alpha transition.


814
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,536
But, here, we're going to create
a second propertyAnimator.


815
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,746
And we're going to use
that to animate the frames


816
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,326
of these images that are
moving around screen.


817
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,366
And the reason we do that is
we might want those animations


818
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,846
to have a different
timing function


819
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,496
than the animations
in the background.


820
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,536
And we'll see that
in just a moment.


821
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,466
So, here, we're just going
to add animations to that.


822
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:30,266
Now we're going to
specify the end position,


823
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,046
or basically the target or the
initial frame of the image.


824
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,196
And then we're going to start


825
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,706
that property animator
and keep track of it.


826
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,996
Now, remember, we have this
other transition animator that's


827
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:40,646
living the lifetime
of this transition


828
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:42,746
that we gave back to the system.


829
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:45,076
And we just need to make
sure that that's animating


830
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:46,186
in the correct direction.


831
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,246
So if we specified a toPosition
of "start", then we need


832
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,256
to reverse that animator.


833
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:54,586
And finally, if this is the
first time that we're calling


834
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,076
through animate here, our
transition animator is going


835
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,526
to be in an inactive state.


836
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,916
So all we need to do is start
that transition animator


837
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,516
and we're off to
the animation phase.


838
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,646
Alternatively, if it's been
started and subsequently paused,


839
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,156
we're going to use
something a little different.


840
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,366
We're going to call in
to continueAnimation


841
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,446
(withTimingParameters
and a durationFactor.


842
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,966
So continueAnimation lets you
continue a paused animation


843
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,846
with different timing parameters
and in different duration,


844
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,106
and the remaining
duration if you'd like.


845
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,356
And here, we're going to
pass "nil", indicating we'd


846
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,686
like to use the timing
parameters that were passed


847
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:27,826
when we initialized this
transition animator.


848
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,786
But we're going to
change the durationFactor


849
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,196
of the continued animation.


850
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:34,606
And that will allow us to
synchronize the durations


851
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,706
of this new itemFrameAnimator
we just created


852
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,766
above with the duration
remaining


853
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:39,876
of this transition animator.


854
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:42,086
So the durationFactor
is just defined


855
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:46,326
as 1.0 equals the initial
duration that was specified


856
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:47,826
when you created this
transition animator.


857
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,946
And that's all we have to do to
kick off the animation phase.


858
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:52,726
And lastly for this cycle,


859
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,896
let's look at the
pauseAnimation step here.


860
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,286
And this is when it's
animating and we paused.


861
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,006
We put our finger down
on the image view.


862
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:01,626
And we just put a
gesture recognizer


863
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,666
on that image view
in the sample app.


864
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,316
And we're free to do that now


865
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:08,146
because UIViewPropertyAnimator
will hit test the animating


866
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:08,996
view automatically.


867
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,606
So on that itemFrameAnimator
we just created above,


868
00:40:12,636 --> 00:40:15,396
we're going to stop that
entirely with a parameter


869
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,316
of "true", indicating to the
system that we have no intention


870
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,676
on continuing this animation,


871
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,836
that we'd like the model
values written directly --


872
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,416
excuse me, the presentation
values written directly back


873
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:26,876
to the model.


874
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,606
And then on the transition
animator, we're just going


875
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:30,996
to call to pauseAnimation.


876
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,056
Because as we saw in
updateInteraction,


877
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,576
we were scrubbing that animation


878
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:36,046
when we were interacting
with the image.


879
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,516
And then, finally,
we'll indicate


880
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,286
to the transition
context that we're moving


881
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:43,516
out of the animation phase
back to the interactive phase.


882
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:46,876
And so I'd like to show
you one more tip and trick,


883
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,286
kind of a little
detail of the demo here.


884
00:40:49,536 --> 00:40:54,706
We saw that this timing is
kind of slow, and I've done


885
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:56,146
that for illustration purposes.


886
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:59,576
But you might want to make
that more natural-feeling


887
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,156
and a little bit more lively.


888
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:04,686
So if we look at changing
that timing to a spring,


889
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,376
it kind of jumps out of the page


890
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:09,666
and only the image is
springing into its position.


891
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,616
And here, those background
animations are continuing


892
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,926
to operate on that .easeOut
curve that we specified.


893
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:16,646
So we were able to
do this change


894
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:19,426
and make this feel much more
lively with really one line


895
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,496
of code, and we can still
interact uninterrupted.


896
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,526
So let's take a look at that
line of code really quick.


897
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,086
So we come back to
our demo and we look


898
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,586
at our propertyAnimator
convenience method.


899
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,606
We'll notice that we're
specifying a property animator


900
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,426
with timing parameters
that are linear here.


901
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:39,126
And that's what gives us
this mechanical feeling.


902
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:41,456
And a colleague of mine
left this great comment


903
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:44,226
in here specifying some
SpringTimingParameters


904
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:47,366
to use instead with a
great mass, stiffness,


905
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:48,536
damping, initial velocity.


906
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,676
And that fully specifies
this spring.


907
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,626
So when we create the
propertyAnimator down here,


908
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:56,476
this duration that we're
passing in actually isn't used.


909
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,776
Rather, it'll be computed based


910
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:00,836
on the properties we've
provided in the spring timing.


911
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,476
And because of that, we have
animation duration helper


912
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:07,896
function here that just uses
the propertyAnimator API


913
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:11,676
that we just saw down below here
to compute the duration for us.


914
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,986
So it basically solves that
spring equation for us.


915
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:16,336
And we can use that to
match the other duration


916
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,376
of the transition animator.


917
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,056
That's all super simple.


918
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:23,386
I know this code is looking
a little bit complex,


919
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,096
but it's really only a
few hundred lines of code.


920
00:42:25,406 --> 00:42:27,676
And UIViewPropertyAnimator
made it all possible.


921
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,976
So, with that, I'd like to
give it back over to Bruce.

>> Thanks, Mike.


924
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,726
OK, I've got to speed things


925
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,276
up because we're a
little bit over time.


926
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:47,036
We need to talk a little
bit about hit testing.


927
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:52,846
We're going to assume that
UserInteractionEnabled is "true"


928
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:55,556
so that we can actually
hit test our views.


929
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,216
If it was "false", we would
just be swallowing all touches.


930
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,876
We have this property called
isManualHitTestingEnabled


931
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,216
that defaults to "false".


932
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,646
And the reason it defaults
to "false" is because we want


933
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,916
to be able to hit
test moving views.


934
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,286
If it were "true", which is the
current behavior of the system,


935
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,656
when you try to touch down
on the position of the view


936
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:17,376
that you saw, we
wouldn't hit test.


937
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:21,786
And perhaps, puzzlingly, it
would hit test where it's going.


938
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,436
We don't want that to happen


939
00:43:23,596 --> 00:43:25,826
for an interruptible
property animator.


940
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:29,136
Now in this talk below, which
I recommend that you see,


941
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:32,886
a technique was given whereby
you could override hit test,


942
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:35,806
do some calculation to convert
to the presentation layer


943
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:39,296
and call "super" so that you
could hit test a moving view.


944
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:41,886
That technique still works.


945
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:45,376
But now with propertyAnimators
if you have a moving view,


946
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:48,166
by default, with manual hit
testing enabled to "false",


947
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,886
we're actually going to
hit test against that view.


948
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:53,746
So that's pretty cool, and
it's really easy to do.


949
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,036
In fact, that's how everything
we've been looking at on stage


950
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,236
so far has been working.


951
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,436
Now this doesn't
work all the time.


952
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,586
If you have deep view
hierarchies and so forth,


953
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,316
we are not going to
do the right thing.


954
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:07,786
So you may need to use
the other technique talked


955
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:08,936
about in the other talk.


956
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,766
OK. We have this whole
other piece of API


957
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:16,606
for keyframe animations
that exist in UIKit today.


958
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:18,356
How do you make those
interruptible?


959
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:21,606
To recall, a keyframe
animation is basically kind


960
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:24,626
of like a regular animation
except you specify the path


961
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,216
that you want to animate from.


962
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,466
We want to make those
interruptible as well.


963
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,846
In fact, we want to do
something like what we're seeing


964
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,396
on this video right now.


965
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,856
We want to pause it, scrub it.


966
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,536
And I guess it's
not too surprising.


967
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:41,996
In fact, you can do it.


968
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:43,446
It's really easy to do.


969
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:47,346
You take the existing API
and you add it as a closure


970
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:50,186
to an animator's animations.


971
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:53,116
And with that, you have
interruptible keyframe


972
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:53,976

00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:05,896
That's the built-in
navigation pop.


979
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:08,876
Currently, if you have an
interaction controller,


980
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,776
you can't use that.


981
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:15,006
But new in iOS 10, if you
put a failure requirement


982
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,946
on that gesture recognizer
or your own,


983
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:22,376
we will allow the built-in pop
gesture recognizer to recognize


984
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:27,126
and use the built-in navigation
transition alongside your
