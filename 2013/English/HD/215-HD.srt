00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,336
>> Hello, welcome to
Optimizing Drawing and Scrolling


2
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:15,906
on Mac OS X [applause].


3
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,946
My name is Corbin Dunn and I'm
an AppKit Software Engineer.


4
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:21,116
I'm going to be giving this talk
with my colleague, Raleigh Ledet


5
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,266
and let's just jump
right into it.


6
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,456
So what we're going to
be talking about today,


7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,286
we have four major subjects.


8
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,256
We're going to be talking about
Optimizing AppKit Drawing,


9
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:34,016
Layer-Backed View Drawing
and utilizing Core Animation


10
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,516
in your views and
how to make it fast.


11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,316
Raleigh is going to come on
stage during the second half


12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,876
and talk about Responsive
Scrolling and what you can do


13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,896
to opt into that and make
it fast on Mavericks.


14
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,806
And then finally,
Raleigh is going to talk


15
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:48,566
about Magnification
in NSScrollView.


16
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:52,926
So let's talk about
Optimizing AppKit Drawing


17
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,536
and the best practices that
you can do in your application.


18
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:02,086
So you're probably already
doing this inside your drawRect.


19
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,766
Inside of your drawRect
implementation, you're looking


20
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:07,116
at the dirtyRect
and just filling


21
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:10,386
and pointing your model objects
inside the area that's actually


22
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:11,856
dirty that you really
need to draw.


23
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:17,136
The interesting thing about this
is you're probably already doing


24
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:19,126
setNeedsDisplayInRect on just


25
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,856
that small little rect
that's really dirty


26
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:21,886
that you need to redraw.


27
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:25,016
You're hopefully not doing
setNeedsDisplay:YES an entire


28
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,346
view and then validating
everything


29
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:27,826
which is not good
for performance.


30
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:31,306
Of course, if you
have a big red view,


31
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,176
you do a setNeedsDisplayInRect
on this little orange rect,


32
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:36,466
you do another
setNeedsDisplayInRect


33
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,016
on another rect and
the same run will pass.


34
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,156
What's going to happen is
your dirtyRect is going


35
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:43,536
to be the union of
those two Rects.


36
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,396
So what you can do
as a developer


37
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,416
to do better drawing is
inside of your drawRect,


38
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:53,526
utilize getRectsBeingDrawn:count
which is some older API


39
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:54,566
that we've had for a while.


40
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,566
You can enumerate all the
dirtyRects and then just fill


41
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,476
in those Rects that are
actually really dirty.


42
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:04,316
Or, what you can also do here is
just pull in your model objects


43
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:07,296
that exist inside those
dirtyRects instead of pulling


44
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,265
in everything inside
of your view bounds


45
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,336
or the visibleRect
or the dirtyRect.


46
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,966
This is much more performant.


47
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:18,246
Another thing you can do is
you can use needsToDrawRect


48
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:21,186
which is some API where
you can say, "Hey,


49
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:24,366
I already have this rect, I need
to draw it or fill in my model.


50
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,796
Do I really need to draw it?"


51
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:28,886
If you do, call needsToDrawRect,
it'll say yes or no


52
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,636
and then you can actually do
your logic based on that answer.


53
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:36,556
What types of things
should you be doing inside


54
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,616
of your drawRect, we should
only be doing drawing inside


55
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:40,316
of your drawRect.


56
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:43,376
You don't want to be doing
network calls, you don't want


57
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:46,386
to be doing image allocation or
loading, you probably don't want


58
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,746
to be doing file access,
you definitely don't want


59
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:52,236
to be doing layout or adding and
removing subviews which are kind


60
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,106
of be a recursive loop.


61
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,116
If you add a view inside
drawing, it's going to need


62
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:58,696
to draw again and
that's not good.


63
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,376
Now, other things that you can
do that are performant, well,


64
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:03,926
hiding a view may
be actually better


65
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:06,246
and faster than adding the view.


66
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:11,206
So, you can utilize setHidden
to make the views be hidden.


67
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:13,926
An exception to this, which I'll
discuss a little bit later is


68
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,406
if you're using layer-backed
views


69
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,656
and I'll discuss the
details on why in a bit.


70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,776
So let's talk a little
bit more about images


71
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,706
and utilizing loading of
images and what you should do.


72
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,706
It's really good to cache images
so if you're using -imageNamed


73
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:34,336
to load an image, you probably
want to retain it into an ivar.


74
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,066
It's quite possible that AppKit
may not retain that image


75
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:41,206
and it may be cached, the cache
may go away so if you want


76
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:43,096
to draw it again and
again, retain it.


77
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:48,716
Now, if you have a big
image that you want to load,


78
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,976
it's probably a good idea to
not load it inside drawRect


79
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,426
and to asynchronously load
it in the background thread.


80
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,996
So you can use an
NSOperationQueue,


81
00:03:57,366 --> 00:04:00,566
add an operation with block to
do some work on the background.


82
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,646
You can actually do
your heavy lifting


83
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,426
such as initWithContentsOfURL
to allocate your image.


84
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,856
You can then kind of
pre-cache and warm the image


85
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,736
by calling
CGImageForProposedRect context:


86
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,656
hints and pass in the actual
size which you're going


87
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:17,935
to be drawing and this will kind
of warm the image up to get be--


88
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,346
to get to be ready
to be drawing.


89
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:24,066
Then once it's warmed
up, you can kick it back


90
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,996
over to the main queue
and add another operation


91
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,566
that actually updates your
image property of your view


92
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,976
and actually marks the
area need to be redrawn


93
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,666
which will then be
happening on the main thread.


94
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:41,906
As I mentioned before, you
only want to do drawing


95
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,776
and don't do any layout in
the background and inside


96
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:48,006
of drawRect so where
should you do layout?


97
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:50,396
You should probably do
layout in the layout method


98
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:54,586
or utilize viewWillDraw,
that's the location to add


99
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:58,266
and remove subviews, mark areas
as being dirty and whatnot.


100
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,026
Definitely, do not
do inside drawRect


101
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:02,696
because it's bad
for performance.


102
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:08,406
Of course, if your view
is opaque, and you want


103
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:10,636
to override isOpaque on
[inaudible] view and say yes.


104
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,456
If your view isn't, then
you have to so say, no.


105
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,806
But if it opaque,
then you tell AppKit,


106
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,936
that we can do more
performing operations


107
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:19,666
by knowing this information.


108
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:23,396
Another thing that you can do


109
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:27,446
to make faster drawing is
override wantsDefaultClipping.


110
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,086
By default, wantsDefaultClipping
says yes,


111
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,316
meaning your view
is going to clip


112
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:35,406
to whatever bounce it
is actually drawing to.


113
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:38,136
Now, if you can strain
all your drawing


114
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,396
to get Rects being drawn,


115
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,306
you can override
-wantsDefaultClipping and say no


116
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:44,106
and we won't do that
clipping for you


117
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,946
and it might be faster
for drawing.


118
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:50,206
There are some methods
in the AppKit


119
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,066
which are a little
bit heavyweight


120
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,366
and called frequently
and it's very good


121
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:56,526
to avoid overriding these
methods if possible.


122
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,316
The class methods are
the GState methods.


123
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:03,966
So if you're overriding or
calling GState, allocateGState,


124
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:08,606
releaseGState and in particular,
setupGState and renewGState,


125
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,606
we'd frequently see people
overriding these methods,


126
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:14,676
in particular, renewGstate
to do things to know


127
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:16,696
when their view's
global position


128
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:17,916
within the window changes.


129
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,816
So for example, the views
frame hasn't really changed


130
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:24,056
but its position inside the
window globally does change


131
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:25,926
and some people are
using this as a hook


132
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:26,776
to know when that happens.


133
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:31,456
Instead, it is much better
to use notifications to find


134
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,006
out when your views
position changes.


135
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,136
Use the
NSViewFrameDidChangeNotification


136
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:39,656
or the NSViewBalanceDidChange
Notification.


137
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,456
Raleigh is going to come
up in a little bit and talk


138
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:45,486
about this a little bit more
with the context of ScrollView.


139
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:52,376
So, that was discussing
typical AppKit drawing and how


140
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:54,506
to do some performant things
for a traditional drawing.


141
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,356
Let's talk about layer-backed
view drawing and some


142
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:02,686
of the best practices for Core
Animation and what you can do.


143
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:06,476
So last year, we gave a
talk on layer-backed views


144
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,516
which I highly recommend going,
digging up, and watching.


145
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,346
It discusses a lot of
things that are great


146
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,416
to get performant animations
using Core Animation.


147
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,866
I'm going to cover a couple of
the properties here very quickly


148
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,536
to just reiterate how
important they are


149
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,686
to get good fast animations.


150
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,506
I'm going to talk about the
layerContentsRedrawPolicy


151
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,566
and also updateLayer
and wantsUpdateLayer.


152
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,436
So in Lion, we introduced
some new API called


153
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:36,236
the layerContentsRedrawPolicy.


154
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,346
It has a whole set
of different values.


155
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:41,556
The one that's the
most important is


156
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:44,866
that NSViewLayerContentsRedraw
OnSetNeedsDisplay.


157
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:51,896
So when you set this property on
your view, what it means is you


158
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,966
as a developer using
a layer-backed view,


159
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,246
whenever your content changes on
the view or your frame changes,


160
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:01,326
you are responsible for
calling setNeedsDisplay.


161
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,836
We do not automatically call
a setNeedsDisplay on the view


162
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:06,966
when the frame changes.


163
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,536
And what this does
is it allows us


164
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:12,666
to utilize Core Animation
animations


165
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,056
to smoothly animate your view.


166
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,516
So prefer to use this
property if you can.


167
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:21,006
The frame change default
is the default value


168
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:25,686
and so we require you to set the
OnSetNeedsDisplay version of it


169
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,856
to opt in and please do so


170
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:32,706
and should get some fast
animations doing this.


171
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:37,336
So how do we do drawing when
we have a layer-backed view?


172
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:41,166
But since we added
updateLayer in Mac OS 10.8,


173
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,686
here is the typical flow
path that we do for drawing.


174
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:47,536
You have a Core Animation
layer and it needs to draw


175
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:48,836
so it was dirty in some way.


176
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:52,986
The next thing that happens
is it ask NSView, hey,


177
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:56,106
do you want to use updateLayer
and depending on what the answer


178
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:59,226
to wantsUpdateLayer is, we
do two different code pass.


179
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,756
So let's say you say no to
wantsUpdateLayer, which is more


180
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,216
of a traditional drawing
in drawRect-based copath.


181
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:10,786
What happens is Core Animation
creates a CGContextRef the size


182
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:11,516
of our view.


183
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,796
That can be thought of as
an image the entire size


184
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:17,696
of your view then
uses a delegate method


185
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,376
drawLayer:inContext
in order for AppKit


186
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,566
to call your drawRect
implementation.


187
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,956
Then whatever you draw and setup
your views bounds is captured


188
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:30,076
into a layered contents
as an image.


189
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,806
Now, you may want to
use wantsUpdateLayer


190
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,496
and I'll describe
why in just a moment.


191
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,726
The way that works is we use a
different delegate method called


192
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:44,276
displayLayer and then we call
instead of AppKit updateLayer


193
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,156
which is a method
that you can override,


194
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,346
you can set whatever
properties you want


195
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:51,186
in the layer including
the layer contents


196
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,586
to provide your representation
of the view.


197
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:56,996
So let's take a look
at doing that.


198
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:59,616
So here is an example
using wantsUpdateLayer.


199
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,126
You override wantsUpdateLayer,
you say yes.


200
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,476
Now, instead of getting
a drawRect,


201
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:07,986
you get an update layer call
and you can set layer properties


202
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,826
to represent how your view
should be represented.


203
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:13,016
So for here, we don't have
to create the backing store,


204
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,666
we don't have to create
that image that back


205
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:17,366
to review instead, you
can just set properties


206
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,736
such as the background
color, the border color,


207
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,446
the border width and you can
represent your user interface


208
00:10:22,446 --> 00:10:24,576
this way without
having to use memory


209
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,066
for the actual backing store.


210
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,526
This is a very efficient
way to update layers


211
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,066
without using a lot of memory.


212
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,806
Speaking of properties
that people can set


213
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:38,416
on Core Animation
layers, you probably want


214
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,196
to avoid properties
that are expensive


215
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:43,426
so if you're using the
cornerRadius property, the mask,


216
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,026
filters, backgroundFilters,


217
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,056
those are all expensive
properties


218
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:50,426
which might make your layer
rendering a little slow.


219
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:53,746
So if possible, try to
do your UI in another way


220
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,646
that can avoid these
properties in order


221
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:56,706
to get better performance.


222
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:02,596
As I mentioned before,
if your view is opaque


223
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,456
and you're saying
yes from isOpaque,


224
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:07,266
that value is directly
assigned to a layer.


225
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,236
And so, opaque layers are much
faster to composite together


226
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:14,666
so prefer to say yes
from isOpaque and realize


227
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,456
that property is
transferred over to the layer.


228
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:22,866
Now, let's say that you are
drawing a big view inside


229
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,936
of your drawRect
of document view.


230
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,056
So you're drawing this big
electric bug picture here.


231
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,806
What you're probably doing
is you're pipe clipping


232
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:35,156
so you have just a tiny little
area that you want the user


233
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:38,186
to see so you have it
inside of this NSClipView.


234
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,486
The ClipView in itself is
inside of the NSScrollView


235
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,376
so you can scroll around
to whatever portion


236
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:48,046
of that view you want to see.


237
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:51,156
So how do we do this when
you're using layer-backed views


238
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:51,616
in AppKit?


239
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:55,806
We have a special layer called
the Tile Layer that we use


240
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:59,706
in AppKit to take your big view
and just chop it up into lots


241
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:01,016
of little individual tiles.


242
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:05,476
Now, your view still has
just the visible area


243
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:08,466
because a clip use clipping
to what you just see.


244
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,266
So what we can do is we can
make intelligent decisions here


245
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,216
where only the tiles
that intersect


246
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,146
in that visible area are things


247
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:18,806
that are going to
actually be drawn.


248
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,146
Everything outside of it
doesn't have to be drawn.


249
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,996
Add a little asterisk next to
this because Raleigh is going


250
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,186
to cover some details where we
might do something differently.


251
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:31,056
So why is this important
to know?


252
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:35,556
Well, all those tiles
inside of your visible area,


253
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,686
each one is going to get its
individual drawRect in order


254
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:39,796
to fill in its contents.


255
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,956
So if you're doing the things
that I recommended at the start,


256
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,406
we're properly watching
for the dirtyRect


257
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:48,526
and getRectsbeingdrawn, you'll
only fill in your model area


258
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,916
and only draw in the areas
which you are drawing


259
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:54,536
to an actual individual tile so
it's very important that you do


260
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,816
that and it's important
to be aware off


261
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,096
that we might be calling
this more than once


262
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:00,706
for one particular visible area.


263
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,886
Of course, we're actually
much more intelligent


264
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,306
than the picture I
was showing before.


265
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:10,176
If your view is very
skinny and tall,


266
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:13,216
our tiles might be really
wide and not very tall


267
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,966
and so we're creating pow
sizes that dynamically change


268
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:18,706
to be the most efficient


269
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,746
for your application
and your view size.


270
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,716
It's important to realize this


271
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,316
because our actual
implementation


272
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:26,686
and how we do the tiling
may change over time


273
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,826
to make it more efficient.


274
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:33,786
So another thing you can do
to get performant drawing


275
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:37,076
in a Core Animation
layer-backed view is to try


276
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,356
and reduce your layer count.


277
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,146
So let's take it a
typical layer-backed view


278
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,376
and see how the hierarchy works.


279
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:45,136
So you have your
top most view here


280
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:46,816
and you do setWantsLayer, yes.


281
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:50,896
Implicitly, all your
subviews are going


282
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,206
to get their own backing layers


283
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,046
so your big parent
one has a layer,


284
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,526
all the subviews each have
their own backing layer.


285
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:00,526
What could be the
problem with this?


286
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:04,086
Well, as I mentioned before,
if you're using drawRect,


287
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:07,996
each of those views might have
their own backing store, again,


288
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:10,646
their own little image contents
and they might be compositing


289
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:13,066
on top of each other which
might be a waste of memory.


290
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,486
You also might have a
high composition cost


291
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:18,216
where if you're not
animating that view around,


292
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,256
why have a bunch of layers there
when they're not really needed.


293
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,246
And unlike just regular AppKit,


294
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:28,446
hidden layers actually might
have a composition cost wherein


295
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:31,086
if they're in the layer tree,
this have to be processed.


296
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,746
So if you a layer-backed view,
it's probably more performant


297
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:37,276
to actually remove the
view from the hierarchy


298
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:38,686
as opposed to hiding it.


299
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,946
And what I mean here having a
couple you are hiding is fine,


300
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,496
but if you're actually
hiding hundreds of views,


301
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,606
that's probably not a good
idea and you probably want


302
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,296
to remove them from
the hierarchy instead.


303
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,116
So, another way to reduce
your subview count--


304
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,116
or sorry, your sublayer count is


305
00:14:56,116 --> 00:15:01,266
to use some new Mac OS 10.9 API
called CanDrawSubviewsIntoLayer


306
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,926
and the setter,
setCanDrawSubviewsIntoLayer.


307
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,876
Let's take a look
at how this works


308
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,846
and why you would
want to use it.


309
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:13,166
So in the same example here,
you have setWantsLayer:YES


310
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:14,696
on your top most view.


311
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:15,776
In addition,


312
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,686
you do
setCanDrawSubviewsIntoLayer:


313
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:17,866
YES.


314
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,526
And what's going
to happen is just


315
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,626
that top most subview is
going to get the actual layer.


316
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:28,046
All those other subviews will
no longer have their individual


317
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:30,896
layers instead, they're
all drawn


318
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:32,806
with their drawRect
implementation


319
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,976
into the parent layer.


320
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,946
The interesting thing here is
even though the parent layer--


321
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:42,116
parent view has a layer, if it
says yes to wantsUpdateLayer,


322
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:46,016
it's not going to get an
update layer call, that view


323
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,996
and its layer and all the
children must utilize drawRect


324
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:49,816
to do their drawing.


325
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:55,196
But this is a great way to
reduce your layer count.


326
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:59,376
So, one interesting thing here
is that what if you did want


327
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,566
to view a subview that has
its own layer because you want


328
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,876
to animate that button around,


329
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,976
you can opt in one individual
subview really easily


330
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,616
by just doing setWantsLayer:YES,
and that view


331
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:12,996
which normally would
have been drawn


332
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:14,826
to parent layer will
now get its own layer


333
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,616
and you can animate
it around smoothly.


334
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:21,066
So why would you want
to reduce these layers?


335
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,496
Let's get a direct example


336
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:24,766
where it might be more
applicable for what you can do.


337
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:29,046
So here's a view base table view
and you want to reduce a lot


338
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,566
of these subviews
into a single layer.


339
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:32,456
You might have made your layer--


340
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,826
or you might have made your
ScrollView layer-backed


341
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,576
so that you can actually
get fast mode--


342
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:41,826
fast smooth scrolling and also,
you can do cool row animations.


343
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,086
But the row animations
themselves are just


344
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,286
on the individual row views.


345
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:48,346
And so what you can do is you
can collapse these row views,


346
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,096
the subviews layers
into one single layer.


347
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,836
So what you can do for each


348
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:58,986
of those table row views do
setCanDrawSubviewsintheLayer:


349
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:02,546
YES for each of them and all
those individual subviews,


350
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,516
the image, the text and
whatnot will be drawn instead


351
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:10,516
of having individual layers into
just one layer of the row view.


352
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,246
One interesting caveat
to note here is


353
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,596
that for text fonts moving
to work such as the title


354
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:19,915
of that word there, it must
be drawn into an opaque area


355
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,736
so the row view or
something else that was drawn


356
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:26,386
in that layer must have filled
with some opaque color in order


357
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:29,276
for fonts moving to work just
something to be aware of.


358
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:34,466
So that was just
discussing layer-backed views


359
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,206
in Core Animation, I'm now
going to bring up Raleigh Ledet


360
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,476
to talk about Responsive
Scrolling.


361
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:42,156
>> So you've seen the demos
already for responsive scrolling


362
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,926
and for an overview, I want to
give you another demo of that


363
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,756
so let's take an example.


364
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,356
So, I'm going to go ahead


365
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,986
and turn off responsive
scrolling globally real quick


366
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,556
and I'm going to run my
little test app here.


367
00:17:56,256 --> 00:18:01,426
And this test app does lots of
horrible things during drawRect


368
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,796
so your drawRect performance
is very poor and you can see


369
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:09,726
that when we try and scroll the
scrolling performance is painful


370
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:10,426
in this app.


371
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:13,456
So we're going to go ahead and
turn responsive scrolling back


372
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:16,296
on and we'll go ahead
and run the same app


373
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,276
and I'll just [inaudible] so
you can see it, there we go.


374
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,876
And now, when we do scrolling,


375
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:27,446
we have nice smooth 60 frames
per second scrolling and--


376
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:31,936
[applause].


377
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:32,726
Thank you.


378
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:36,066
And, you know, that's--
that was the point


379
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,346
of responsive scrolling, we want
60 frames per second buttery


380
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,906
smooth scrolling, I could just
keep listing bullet points


381
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:43,746
of describing this all day long.


382
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:45,296
We're excited about it.


383
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:48,856
And I'm going to give you
a quick brief overview


384
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:52,706
of how this works and you've
already seen this but--


385
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,166
say you have your document
view which is obviously inside


386
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,666
of a clip view and only a
small portion of it is visible


387
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,876
and traditionally,
that's all that was drawn.


388
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,796
When we get responsive
scrolling,


389
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:06,166
we're going to ask your
document view to draw portions


390
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,976
that aren't visible and
we call that the overdraw.


391
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,616
And now that once we
have this overdraw,


392
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,086
on a background thread,
we can go ahead


393
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,366
and change what the user sees
on screen very, very quickly


394
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,626
to any portion that we
have that's already drawn


395
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,386
in the overdraw.


396
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,786
And in a nutshell, that's
all that we're really doing


397
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:24,846
with responsive scrolling.


398
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,756
Under the hood, there's a
lot going on and I'm going


399
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,016
to cover some of those details.


400
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,296
Particular, I'm going to
talk about the overdraw model


401
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,426
and exactly how it works.


402
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,206
The event model, there's lots
of big changes going on there.


403
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:39,216
Some API that we have to
help you adapt to the changes


404
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,066
that we have and what you
need to do in your application


405
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,336
so that you can make sure
that your application adopts


406
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:45,366
in to responsive scrolling.


407
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,196
So let's kick off with overdraw.


408
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:54,036
The main thing about overdraw
is still main thread driven.


409
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,576
Your drawrect calls, they're
always going to be called


410
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,296
in the main thread so
you don't have to worry


411
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,936
about doing any additional
locking


412
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,756
that your app wasn't
already doing,


413
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,046
you can access the
view hierarchy


414
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,276
and you're data model
just like you always did.


415
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,756
Of course, drawRect is
now going to be called


416
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,886
with nonvisible Rects.


417
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,766
So as Corbin mentioned
earlier, it's really important


418
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,296
that you respect
those dirtyRects


419
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,996
and you only do drawing and
you do it just in the areas


420
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:17,266
that we're asking you to draw.


421
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:24,276
When your app is idle, that's
when one figures a good time


422
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,506
for us to go ahead and ask
you to generate some overdraw.


423
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,956
We're only going to ask you
though for a little portion


424
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,256
of overdraw that way
your drawRect can be fast


425
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:33,736
and if the user tries
to interact


426
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,486
with the application
while you're in the middle


427
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:38,666
of generating overdraw, that
overdraw drawing will be quick


428
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,526
and the user will not see any
lag between trying to interact


429
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,526
with your application while
you're generating overdraw.


430
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,186
So last just for a little
bit, that will get drawn,


431
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:47,976
we have some overdraw,
that's great.


432
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:50,206
The application is still idle
so we'll say, "Hey, great,


433
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,076
let's draw a little bit more
and we'll draw some more


434
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,686
and this is going to go around
all the access that you have


435
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:56,976
for your scroll view."


436
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,516
This one is only
doing vertically


437
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:00,036
so we'll just go up and down.


438
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,226
So we have a little bit more.


439
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,096
If your app is still idle,
we just continue this process


440
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:09,016
until AppKit has decided
that we have enough overdraw


441
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,746
to be responsive for what
the user is likely to do.


442
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:17,196
Now, we don't want to
draw your entire document,


443
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:20,256
that would be a huge backing
store and that would take a lot


444
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,336
of memory and it would even
take a lot of power just


445
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:25,866
to have you draw that
whole document view.


446
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:26,616
So we don't want to do that.


447
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,976
AppKit plays a very
careful balancing act


448
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:31,786
between how much overdraw we
have so that it's responsive


449
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:35,626
for the user and not
using too much memory


450
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,576
and not using too much power
to be able to accomplish this.


451
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,976
And we even go a step
further and where possible.


452
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,546
We'll make sure that
those backing stores


453
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,966
that we're creating to hold
the overdraw are purgeable


454
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:45,916
by the Kernel.


455
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,446
So if there's memory
pressure on the system,


456
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,506
that memory can be
freed by the Kernel


457
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,056
without even waking
your application


458
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:53,206
and when your application
becomes active again,


459
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:56,376
we'll notice that and we'll ask
for those areas to be redrawn.


460
00:21:56,976 --> 00:22:00,546
And this is great and in
general, you won't have


461
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:03,216
to do anything but sometimes
it's not quite enough.


462
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:06,936
You need to be able
to watch what's going


463
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,626
on with overdraw
and react to that.


464
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,736
One example is if you are
adding your own subviews


465
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:15,866
that you only want the
subviews for your documents


466
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,646
that are visible to be there.


467
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:18,986
This is a common technique.


468
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:20,866
Table view does this for
a view-based table views.


469
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,626
Now, you need to make
sure with overdraw


470
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:26,826
that those subviews exist
in the overdraw area is well


471
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,536
so that they are
always going to be ready


472
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:29,946
for when the user
scrolls to those.


473
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:34,486
So we have new API that you
can adopt and you can play


474
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,396
around in the overdraw
world then make sure


475
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,556
that your content is
going to be available.


476
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,636
And let's give you
an example of that.


477
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:44,126
In your document view, you would
override PrepareContentInRect


478
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:49,466
and we'll go ahead and pass
in the rect during idle when--


479
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,136
whenever we want to
prepare some new content.


480
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:53,756
And the rect that
actually gets passed


481
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,096
in is not just a little
sliver that we're going


482
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,336
to eventually ask you to draw.


483
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:01,476
It includes the entire overdraw
area that we want currently


484
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,806
which is always going to at
least include your visible rect


485
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:06,586
and in this case, the new
little section of purple here.


486
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,446
Then you go ahead and you
prepare you content as needed.


487
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,126
In this example, this is what
we're going to add our subview


488
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:15,276
to the view hierarchy because
this is of course called


489
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:16,526
on the main thread always.


490
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:19,396
So, adding a few
to the hierarchy


491
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,716
at this point is perfectly safe.


492
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:25,046
Now, when you override
and PrepareContentInRect,


493
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:28,966
you're not just reacting to
the rects that we're provided


494
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,936
in you to do overdraw.


495
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:33,586
You can actually be
an active participant


496
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,136
in deciding how much
overdraw is being used.


497
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:38,926
And in this example of the
subviews there, we don't want


498
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:41,586
to clip half of it
off in the overdraw,


499
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:42,736
it's just a little bit.


500
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,936
So when we tell super how
much overdraw you've prepared,


501
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,826
we want to extend it just a
little bit and cover the edge


502
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:51,636
of that subview and that will
be a little bit more efficient.


503
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:53,596
So you can be an active
participant in this.


504
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,566
After you return from
this, little bit later,


505
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,176
we'll go ahead ask that
new section to be drawn


506
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:02,536
and we'll have that in the
overdraw ready to be scrolled


507
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:04,516
to for the user at
a moment's notice.


508
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:07,966
Of course, if you have a
still idle, we'll go ahead


509
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,796
and start asking
for more overdraw


510
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,416
and as you've seen before, we'll
just continue this process.


511
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,696
Continue to call,
PrepareContentInRect


512
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:17,856
and to just further
drive the point home.


513
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,376
Now, the rect thats getting
passed includes that overdraw


514
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,936
that we drew earlier, the
visible rect and the new section


515
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:23,876
of overdraw that we want


516
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:26,356
so you can make sure the whole
area is properly prepared.


517
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:31,876
Again, when I've talked about
being an active participant


518
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:36,376
under very specialized
circumstances you might know,


519
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:40,836
when is the better
time to end overdraw?


520
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:43,206
AppKit plays is very
careful balancing act,


521
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:46,306
there are some situations
out there where you know


522
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:48,236
that pulling in a
certain amount of content


523
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,326
for you makes more sense


524
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:51,096
than AppKit would
otherwise want to do.


525
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:55,046
And in that case, if the rect
you return as super as the same


526
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:57,946
as the previous time we
called PrepareContentInRect,


527
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:02,366
then we'll of course-- we won't
ask for that area to be drawn


528
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:05,296
and we're going to stop
asking for overdraw


529
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,456
on idle unless the overdraw
gets blown away for some reason


530
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:11,316
and then we'll come back on
idle and rebuild it from scratch


531
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,276
where you can terminate it
again through the same mechanism


532
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:17,816
that once you return the same
rect twice in a row, we go ahead


533
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,786
and stop asking for it.


534
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:23,796
Of course, now that you have
content that isn't even visible,


535
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:26,816
if that content becomes dirty,
please setNeedsDisplayInRect


536
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,486
and just those portions
that have been dirtied


537
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,176
and we will go ahead and have
those redrawn when appropriate


538
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,966
and that way when we
scroll to that section,


539
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:39,126
it's always the most up to
date content for the user.


540
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,836
There's some special
circumstances where you need


541
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:46,406
to tell AppKit that you should
totally get rid of any--


542
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:48,066
of all that prepared
overdraw that we have.


543
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,436
And you can set the
PreparedContentInRect


544
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,676
in this case to the
visible rect.


545
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:55,366
For example, the user might
have changed something,


546
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:58,796
choose a different group
of items which are going


547
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:00,646
to totally change the
content that you're showing


548
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:04,766
in the scroll view and the
original prepared content there


549
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,966
is completely not even
appropriate anymore.


550
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,986
So, you want to go ahead and
tell AppKit to just drop it all


551
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:11,856
and we'll drop down
to the visible rect


552
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,806
and the next pass
to the run loop.


553
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,036
We'll draw the content
for the visible rect


554
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,206
and that's what the user
will see, and during idle,


555
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:22,426
we'll build it back up with your
new content that's appropriate.


556
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:26,566
So, all of this with overdraws
are done on the main thread,


557
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,186
drawRect is being called
your nonvisibleRect,


558
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,066
make sure your drawRects
are only doing drawing


559
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,476
and they're as fast as possible.


560
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:37,486
In general, let AppKit balance
the amount of overdraw along


561
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:41,116
with memory empower usage and
purgeable memory and handle all


562
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:42,696
of that complicated matter.


563
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:47,076
Only if you have specialized
needs then you can go ahead


564
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:48,906
and cut that short a
little bit perhaps.


565
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:52,616
In other circumstances like when
you're adding your own views


566
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:55,496
and then make sure that the
prepared content is there


567
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,966
in the view hierarchy,
then go ahead


568
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:01,126
and use the prepared content
rect API that we have.


569
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,196
So that's overdraw.


570
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,756
Let's move-- switch gears and
talk about the event model.


571
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:09,456
A lot of exciting things here
as already been pointed out.


572
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,496
But let's back off a
little bit and talk


573
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,686
about the traditional way
that scrolling is handled.


574
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:17,216
You got a scroll
wheel event comes


575
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:18,556
in through your scrolling
device.


576
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:20,046
It gets put into an event queue


577
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,586
and your main run loop is
running on the main thread


578
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:25,356
of your application
handling event sources


579
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:28,646
and other run loop sources,
pulls the scroll wheel event


580
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,926
out of the queue, we hitTest
that scroll wheel event,


581
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,576
they get passed to
your document--


582
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,496
your some subview of
your document view.


583
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,866
And then we call
scroll wheel on that,


584
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:40,966
that goes up the responder chain
finally gets to scroll wheel


585
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:42,406
and in that scroll view,


586
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:44,406
then that scroll view
moves your content,


587
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:47,306
withdraw the little section of
content that became available


588
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:50,156
and we'd let the run loop go
back to handling event sources


589
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:51,886
and the next scroll
wheel comes in


590
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,876
and we do the whole
process all over again


591
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:56,126
for every single scroll
wheel event that comes in.


592
00:27:56,126 --> 00:28:00,626
Well with Responsive scrolling,
we break that cycle and once


593
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,966
that first event comes in
as soon as it gets to--


594
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,986
in a scroll view, and
the scroll view sets


595
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:06,436
up concurrent tracking thread


596
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,566
and it will now handle the
events on the background thread.


597
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,346
The scroll wheel events from
the track pad are now going


598
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:15,156
to be routed to this private
event queue so you won't be able


599
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:18,316
to see them at all and they will
be processed by the scroll wheel


600
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:21,306
and now your main thread
is allowed to just run


601
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,836
as it normally would
processing other events


602
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:24,886
and other run loop sources.


603
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:26,796
Let's dig in a little bit more


604
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:28,216
with the concurrent
tracking thread


605
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:32,196
and inspect a little bit further
on exactly what its doing.


606
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:35,416
It's pulling events from the
event queue and it figures


607
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,706
out where we want to
move the scrolling.


608
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:41,196
And so we can change that
do the user very quickly


609
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,506
on a background thread, anywhere
that we have the overdraw.


610
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,026
So let's say it lands
right there,


611
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,496
course your main thread
run loop is still running,


612
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:50,766
it's still doing its
thing respecting timers


613
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:51,406
that are firing.


614
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,606
But if you would ask
your view hierarchy


615
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,166
at this point what the visible
rect is, it's still going


616
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,256
to say is that blue
square up there.


617
00:28:59,056 --> 00:29:02,166
Though what the users sees on
screen is the red dashed area.


618
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:06,066
So, that's an important thing to
realize as what the users sees


619
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,196
on screen can be different


620
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,566
than what your main
thread is reporting.


621
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,486
Now, the concurrent tracking
thread whenever it updates the


622
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,286
screen, it goes ahead


623
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,006
and it issues a synchronization
request on the main thread.


624
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:18,586
This gets run in
the main thread,


625
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:21,956
it talks it in a scroll view and
it actually does the scroll too


626
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:25,766
and all of your view properties
are going to be updated


627
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,496
and their visible rect will
be the most up to date version


628
00:29:28,496 --> 00:29:30,226
of the visible rect that
we possible can have.


629
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:35,056
And normally and traditionally,
this would cause drawRects


630
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:37,946
to occur but hopefully here,
since we already have overdraw,


631
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:40,256
this is just updating
the view frames changes,


632
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:41,936
this can happen very,
very, quickly.


633
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,896
And if-- and once the
synchronization occurs,


634
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:48,126
it'll match with what we have
on the screen and every--


635
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,566
everything will be in sync.


636
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:52,286
And if this happens in
exact same display refresh


637
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:55,006
that the concurrent tracking
thread move things then


638
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:57,686
everything appears
to be in sync.


639
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:03,106
The other thing that the
synchronization request does is


640
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,506
if your app-- if your main
thread is otherwise idle,


641
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:06,906
it'll ask for some prefetch.


642
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,236
So we'll do some more overdraw.


643
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:12,336
In this case, the
concurrent tracking thread


644
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,306
and the synchronizer know
what direction the user is


645
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:14,786
scrolling in.


646
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,836
So we ask for prefetch
in that direction.


647
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,166
So unlike idle which is
trying to get a general case,


648
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,766
this is more specific and
we can get drawing ahead


649
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:24,616
of where the user is
going but it does bring


650
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,836
up an interesting situation.


651
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,616
What happens when the user
tries to scroll to area


652
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:30,696
that you haven't been
able to catch up to yet.


653
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:34,176
Well, in that case,
we have to back off


654
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,946
and respect what the main
thread can keep up with.


655
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,306
We don't want to show blank
content that could be drawing


656
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,316
and confusing to the user.


657
00:30:42,836 --> 00:30:46,476
So we end up-- what's we run
out of overdraw, we have to slow


658
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,346
down to whatever the
main thread can do


659
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:49,906
and if the main thread
catches back up,


660
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,906
because maybe it was
just a long processing


661
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,466
of some timer information,


662
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,566
once the main thread
can catch back up,


663
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,296
if the user is still
scrolling, we can get back


664
00:30:58,296 --> 00:30:59,256
into responsive scrolling.


665
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,506
But it's a situation
we want to avoid.


666
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,726
So, my point here is
it's not a silver bullet.


667
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:08,526
Responsive scrolling works
really great to make sure


668
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:11,736
that it's responsive right away
when the users starts scrolling


669
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:13,916
and that there are
any little hiccups


670
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,106
that your main thread might
have in responding to timers


671
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:18,996
or network request or anything
like that won't interfere


672
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:22,096
with user's experience
but at some point,


673
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:24,466
if your app can't keep up and
the user is scrolling fast


674
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,966
and they're scrolling
far, we'll have to drop


675
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,896
down to whatever your
main thread can handle.


676
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:31,036
So quick overview,


677
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,616
event tracking is now
done concurrently.


678
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,586
Once we get that first
scroll wheel event,


679
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:36,626
you won't see the other ones


680
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,356
until the gesture
is fully completed.


681
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,126
What's on the screen may not
match what the main thread is


682
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:45,506
reporting as the visibleRect
and it's not a silver bullet.


683
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:48,026
So make sure you drawRects
are as fast as possible


684
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:49,716
and you're only doing
drawing in those drawRects.


685
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:54,296
Let's go ahead and move on to
some API and how you can play


686
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,236
with this brand new world.


687
00:31:55,666 --> 00:32:00,486
Overriding scroll wheel
is obviously isn't going


688
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,396
to work the way that it used
to because scroll will use


689
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:05,146
to see every single scroll wheel
event in your document view


690
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:07,636
or in your subclass and
that's not the case anymore.


691
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,266
A better way of watching
scrolling changes is


692
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,216
to watch the clip
views bound changes.


693
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:15,356
And the clip view of
course is the contentView


694
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:17,736
of the scrollView and you'll
need to tell the clip view


695
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,146
to pout-- to post its
bounds change notifications


696
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,956
so setPostBoundsChanged
Notifications: YES,


697
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,516
and then once the clip view
is posting its bounds change


698
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,756
notifications, you
can ask to observe


699
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:31,256
that on the notification center


700
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:34,546
with the NSViewBoundsDidChange
Notification on the clip view.


701
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,116
Now, this is better in general
then overriding scroll wheel


702
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:42,016
because now you'll be informed
anytime the scroll wheel--


703
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,156
the scroll view scrolls
which could be in response


704
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:47,286
to a scroll wheel event,
it might be in response


705
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:51,956
to the user moving the scroll
bar, it might be in response


706
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:54,956
to keyboard access or it could
be even you've programatically


707
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,906
moved the clip view bounds.


708
00:32:58,086 --> 00:33:00,186
And this way, you'll catch all
of those and you can respond


709
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,116
to them appropriately
in your application all


710
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:05,416
in one central case-- all in
one central place without having


711
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,096
to have codes sprinkled all over
your application to handle that.


712
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,286
So this is the way that we've
been suggesting that you watch


713
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,646
for your scroll view
bounds changes instead


714
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:15,816
of overriding scroll wheel.


715
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:19,066
However, there's a case
where you really want to know


716
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,926
that the user initiated
scrolling.


717
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,076
Well, until now,


718
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:25,756
we've implemented some new
live scroll notifications


719
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,196
and you can get exactly
that information.


720
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:32,386
You can find out when the user
starts to do a live scroll,


721
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:33,806
you'll get a whole bunch of Dids


722
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:36,906
as the user is scrolling every
time we move the content.


723
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:40,096
And then when the last
scrolling completely ends,


724
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,446
you'll get a DidEndLiveScroll.


725
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,426
So this worked great
with the gesture capable


726
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:45,466
scrolling devices.


727
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,506
And what we do here
with these devices is


728
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:51,046
as the user scrolls
multiple times consecutively,


729
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:54,386
you will only see one bracket
of will start and did end.


730
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,226
So even though the user
scrolled three or four,


731
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:58,416
five times in a row
will coalesce those all


732
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,826
into one will start, a whole
bunch of dids and did end.


733
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:06,556
Not only that, we will
actually extend this


734
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,776
across the animations.


735
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,856
So if the user goes into
rubber banding for example


736
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,485
and there are no more
events coming in,


737
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:13,896
there's that little bit of a
rubber band animation going on.


738
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:17,216
We don't call dead-end until
the animation completes.


739
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,906
And every frame of the
animation we issued dids.


740
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:23,156
So you've got a will start,
some dids, the animation starts,


741
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:24,146
you'll get a few more dids.


742
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:25,446
When it ends, you'll get a--


743
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,456
in a scroll view
did end live scroll


744
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,416
and the scroll is
completely over at that point.


745
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,166
We take it a step further


746
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,626
and says this is user-initiated
scrolling, we can--


747
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,346
we know when they're
tracking the scroll bar.


748
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,116
Now, this is checking the
scroll bar still driven


749
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:41,116
on the main thread in this case
but we know when it starts,


750
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,096
we know every frame
that happens in between


751
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:44,446
and we know when it stops.


752
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,545
So we'll go ahead and
report those notifications


753
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:47,065
in that case.


754
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:50,976
We'll even do this for
keyboard things, page up


755
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,096
and page down for example.


756
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:53,666
Those are animations generally.


757
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,065
Well, we know when
the animation starts


758
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:57,036
and we knows when--
we know when it ends.


759
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,716
And then all of these
cases, the--


760
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:02,826
these notifications are being
issued on the main thread.


761
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:04,356
So that's an important
thing to point out.


762
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,726
Your notifications-- these live
scroll notifications are always


763
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,026
issued on the main thread.


764
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:12,156
But this device is a
little interesting.


765
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,346
If you look at the devices


766
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,376
that actually have a physical
scroll wheel or something


767
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:20,526
that has like a scroll ball
like the Mighty Mouse, it does--


768
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:23,656
we don't know when it starts,
we don't know when it ends.


769
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:25,666
All we know is that a
scroll wheel event happened.


770
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,246
Another one might happen
soon, it might not.


771
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:32,096
So in that case, we issued just
a did live scroll notification


772
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,136
and of course, that's
going to happen


773
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:35,086
on the main thread just
like all the others.


774
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:37,636
So, if you're looking for
this and you're looking


775
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,926
for user-initiated scrolling,
it's important to realize


776
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:41,806
that some devices
won't be bracketed


777
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,246
with the will start
and a did end.


778
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:49,626
If you have some floating
subviews in your content,


779
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:52,796
like let's look at
this table view here.


780
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:54,006
It's a floating group row.


781
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,696
What's going on here during
scrolling is that your--


782
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:00,706
generally, you have a subview
in your content, it scrolls


783
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:02,336
and you change the
frame of this view.


784
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,146
So to the user, it appears


785
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:05,346
that it's floating
above your content.


786
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,186
It hasn't moved.


787
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:09,756
Though in reality, it has moved
within your view hierarchy


788
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,326
or for moving the content
on the background thread


789
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:13,326
that can get out of sync.


790
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:16,056
And it's a lot of code
that you shouldn't have


791
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,186
to write for yourself anyway.


792
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:20,976
So in a scroll view, we have
this new API addFloatingSubviews


793
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,376
for access, you tell us which
access you want this view


794
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:27,296
to be floating on and we'll go
ahead and put in a special place


795
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:28,106
in the view hierarchy


796
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:32,556
and scrolling will be
handled automatically in sync.


797
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,976
So if you're scrolling ob the
access is not floating on,


798
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:38,396
it'll scroll that content in
sync with the clip views content


799
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:42,276
and when it's floating, it's
just handled automatically


800
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:45,216
for you without you having
to update those frames.


801
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,466
So, it's less code for you
to write, a lot easier to do,


802
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,016
and this is what table
view does automatically


803
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:53,866
for responsive scrolling
on 10.9.


804
00:36:53,866 --> 00:37:01,136
So that was a whole-- there's
a whole lot there going


805
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,356
on with responsive scrolling.


806
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:06,286
In order to adopt in
to responses scrolling,


807
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:08,586
you have to be linked
on 10.8 or later.


808
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,186
Your window that your
scroll view was in,


809
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:14,646
its alpha must be 1, it
has to be completely opaque


810
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,736
and your document must
not be an OpenGL context.


811
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,326
These are the absolute
basics that we need


812
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:24,736
to start adopting your scroll
views into responsive scrolling.


813
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,666
We have a few more.


814
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:29,816
But from that-- this point on,
we try to make it as automatic


815
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:31,316
as possible, we want you to--


816
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,976
have to do as a little
work as possible.


817
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,856
But as you know,
scrolling is the cooperation


818
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:39,216
of a scroll view, the clip
view, and your document view.


819
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:43,026
If anyone of these views for
whatever reason can adopt


820
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,566
into responsive scrolling,
then as a collection,


821
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,826
these three views won't
do responsive scrolling.


822
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:55,646
I'm going to talk about some
more things that you need to do


823
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:57,776
to adopt in the responses
going in the next few slides.


824
00:37:58,036 --> 00:38:01,046
But from this point on, you
can use this explicit API


825
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:03,576
isCompatibleWithResponsive
Scrolling


826
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,336
to bypass all those checks.


827
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,536
When you return yes,
we won't even check


828
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,096
and we'll just adopt you


829
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,076
in the responsive
scrolling from this point on.


830
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:18,656
Obviously, you can override
scrollWheel or lockFocus,


831
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,326
scrollWheel in particular
as we've covered,


832
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:21,976
there's a huge behavior
change here.


833
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:24,986
So if you notice that,
your scroll view subclass,


834
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:25,856
your clip view subclass,


835
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:29,046
your document view is overriding
scroll wheel then we're going


836
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:30,996
to adopt you in to
responsive scrolling.


837
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:35,106
So please as I've pointed out
earlier, use other API and try


838
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,126
and just remove your scroll
wheel override all together.


839
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:40,606
Or if you absolutely have
to have it and you're OK


840
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:42,766
with just peaking at the one
event because you need to decide


841
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:46,056
if it's a scroll or not period,
before you have been passed it


842
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:49,026
to super, then go ahead
and override scrollWheel


843
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:50,916
and in the class that
you override scrollWheel,


844
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,396
override is compatible
with responsive scrolling.


845
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:56,766
Remember, it's a class
method and return yes.


846
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,176
lockFocus turns out with the way


847
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:01,216
that we do overdraw
just isn't applicable.


848
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,566
So, please stop overriding
lockFocus.


849
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:07,446
But, you can-- like I said,
with the previous slide,


850
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,896
this is something
that you can override


851
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,236
with the
isCompatibleWithResponsive


852
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,706
Scrolling and you can find


853
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:12,926
out what happens in
your application.


854
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:16,596
From this point on,
we have two models


855
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:19,646
that we've been talking about,
the traditional drawing model


856
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,516
and the layer-backed
model that we have


857
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:22,946
and Corbin covered
the various cases.


858
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:25,226
Responses scrolling
support both.


859
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:29,016
If you're using traditional
drawing then copiesOnScroll


860
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,946
which is a property actually on
the clip view, but there's also


861
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:34,996
on the scroll view and it
brought it over to the clip view


862
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:38,856
and there's little check you
can check in interface builder.


863
00:39:39,216 --> 00:39:42,156
That should be yes and
isOpaque must return yes


864
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:42,986
for the document view.


865
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:45,406
The isOpaque one
is really important


866
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:46,956
because as Corbin
covered earlier,


867
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:49,986
in order to get fonts moving
right, your checks needs to be


868
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:54,576
on an opaque-- needs to
have opaque pixels in order


869
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,976
for fonts moving
to work correctly.


870
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,586
And if your isOpaque
is returning no


871
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:02,726
which is the default case, then
we're not sure what's going


872
00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:04,136
on there and we won't
be able to adopt you


873
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:04,976
in to responsive scrolling.


874
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:09,236
However, if you know that your
view has some transparent parts


875
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:11,476
but those transparent
parts don't have any text,


876
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:15,086
then go ahead and override
the isCompatibleWithResponsive


877
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:17,926
Scrolling and you can have
a non-opaque document view.


878
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:19,896
Or you can just go layer-backed.


879
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:21,606
We don't even check
the copiesOnScroll


880
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:23,506
and isOpaque if you layer-back.


881
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:25,986
But when you go layer-back,
you need to make sure


882
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:28,916
that your layer-back at least
at the end of scroll view layer,


883
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:33,206
in a scroll view level, or any
of the scroll views ancestors.


884
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:37,326
You can do that by calling
setWantsLayer on the scroll view


885
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,196
or you have a scroll
view subclass,


886
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:41,716
you can just return
yes from wantsLayer.


887
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:44,206
An interface builder in
the Core Animation section,


888
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:45,636
there's a nice little check box


889
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:49,136
and that check box is the same
thing as saying setWantsLayer


890
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:52,276
and so you would do that on a
scroll view or its ancestor.


891
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,866
And also, as Corbin mentioned,


892
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:58,726
I want to reiterate the
canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer.


893
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,446
There are different
performance characteristics


894
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:03,106
when you go layer-back,
when you have--


895
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,206
you have to composite all those
different layers together.


896
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:09,096
So, depending on your
application and the amount


897
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:11,686
of memory that all these
layers use and what--


898
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:15,446
and exactly what you're
animating, you can decide


899
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:17,856
at what is the appropriate
level that you want


900
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:21,086
to collapse these all down
into one layer and the--


901
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:23,416
Corbin's example that he gave
was great, you might want


902
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,936
to do it for a view-based
table view


903
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,326
on the row view for example.


904
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:29,566
And that way, you can animate
each individual row smoothly


905
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:35,706
and quickly, but this will be a
lot less layers for us to have


906
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:36,666
in the view hierarchy


907
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,666
to composite together
for each frame.


908
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:43,566
We have some support in Xcode


909
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,386
for helping you debug
some of this stuff.


910
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:47,706
When you're running
application at this new menu


911
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:50,166
which has some neat--
some neat options,


912
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,346
in particular Show
Responsive Scrolling Status.


913
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:56,116
If your scroll view is not
opted into responsive scrolling,


914
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,866
it'll look like this and
well, we don't want that.


915
00:41:58,866 --> 00:41:59,916
What we want is this.


916
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:00,506le
We want green.


917
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:00,506
We want green.


918
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:05,456
So, if everything turns out--


919
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:07,886
everything is laid out
appropriately, and we can opt


920
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:11,236
in your view, all of the views
into the responsive scrolling,


921
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:14,096
your scroll view or subclass,
your NSClipView subclass,


922
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:18,146
and the document view, it'll
be green and this is a way


923
00:42:18,146 --> 00:42:20,016
of being able to provide
that feedback to you


924
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:23,106
through the debugger that your
scroll view has completely opted


925
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,096
in to responsive scrolling.


926
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,346
So in summary, we
really want to make this


927
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,866
as automatic as possible.


928
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:33,826
You can explicitly opt in but
do that as a last resort please,


929
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:37,706
but there are cases where
that's the only way to do it.


930
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,236
Think carefully about
layer-backing


931
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:41,206
if you're not already
layer backed,


932
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:42,176
if you want to go layer-backed,


933
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:43,926
there's some difference
performance characteristics.


934
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:46,666
So, but for responsive
scrolling,


935
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,956
we'll support both layer-backed
and traditional drawing.


936
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:52,076
And you can use Xcode to verify.


937
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:53,506
So that comes out to be handy.


938
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:58,066
So, thats responsive
scrolling and we'll go ahead


939
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,696
and move on to magnification.


940
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:04,016
Specifically, in magnification
as relates to NSScrollView.


941
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:08,286
And 10.8, we introduced
magnification support natively


942
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:09,896
into NSScrollView
and all you have


943
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:11,926
to do is set the
allowsMagnification property


944
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:14,646
which you can also do
an interface builder.


945
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:16,646
There's a nice little check
box and you could check that.


946
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:21,786
And your scroll view will
response to the pitch gesture


947
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:24,086
and we'll do zooming
and magnification


948
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:24,776
for you automatically.


949
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:30,156
When it comes to responsiveness,
if your scroll view is opted


950
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:31,116
into responsive scrolling,


951
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:34,546
magnification is still main
thread driven at the moment.


952
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:38,916
But you'll likely to have
overdraw and we can use that.


953
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:43,326
So during the magnification
gesture, we use that overdraw


954
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:44,956
and we scale your
existing content.


955
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,866
So if you have content like
this and you zoom into it,


956
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:49,806
during the overdraw, it
will scale that content


957
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:50,936
and it will look
kind of like this.


958
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:53,606
But when the gesture
completes, we'll go ahead


959
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:56,376
and redraw the visible
rect when the gesture ends


960
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:59,276
and we'll get the nice
crisp content back in there.


961
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,656
But during that whole gesture,
it was nice and responsive


962
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,896
to the user, we weren't
even calling drawRect,


963
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:06,976
so that was great.


964
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:09,776
If you're going the opposite
direction for example


965
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:12,816
and you get to here and we run
out of overdraw, we don't want


966
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,736
to draw blank content
on the sides there.


967
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:18,316
So in this case, if we run out
of overdraw, we have to pause


968
00:44:18,316 --> 00:44:19,416
and wait for new drawing to come


969
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,726
in since this is all
main thread driven


970
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:25,786
and so the user will see a
lag in the responsiveness


971
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:27,856
of your magnification here.


972
00:44:28,146 --> 00:44:30,036
So make sure you
drawRects are as fast


973
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:32,306
as possible but they'll pop in.


974
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,676
During the middle
of the gesture,


975
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,656
if new content comes in,
that content will be drawn


976
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:39,746
at the appropriate scale because
your drawRect will be called.


977
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:43,066
Likewise, if you dirty
any content in the middle


978
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:46,016
of a magnification gesture,
we will redraw that content


979
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,146
at the appropriate scale factors


980
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:51,026
but that will require
a drawRect right


981
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,286
in the middle of your gestures.


982
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:53,936
So you want to try
and prevent that.


983
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:57,736
So when it comes
to magnification,


984
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,116
your drawRect speed is crucial


985
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:03,156
to getting responsive
feedback to the user.


986
00:45:04,446 --> 00:45:06,656
We do have some live
magnification notifications,


987
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:08,266
these were introduced with 10.8


988
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:10,826
when we introduced
magnifications NSScrollView,


989
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:12,826
the WillStartLiveMagnification
Notification


990
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:15,366
and
DidEndLiveMagnifynNotification.


991
00:45:15,366 --> 00:45:19,876
These are great that you can
perhaps stop doing some things


992
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:23,426
in the main thread, turn off
some timers or pause some things


993
00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:26,316
so that you can devote as much
as your resources as possible


994
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:28,326
to being responsive to
what the user is the doing


995
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:29,466
with the magnification gesture.


996
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:34,786
If you're overriding clip
view, one of the reasons--


997
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:36,616
main reasons people
override clip view is


998
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:39,066
to center the content
in your clip view


999
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:41,406
when your content is smaller
than the size of your clip view.


1000
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:44,076
And to do that, you override
constrainScrollPoint.


1001
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,556
And with magnification,


1002
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:49,166
if you zoom pass the
minimum amount here,


1003
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:53,066
when the user removes their
fingers, we want that to animate


1004
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:55,046
to the center, but
this is what happens.


1005
00:45:56,116 --> 00:45:58,326
In constrainScrollPoint,
you're given a point


1006
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:01,636
and all you have is whatever
the current bounds are


1007
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:02,826
of the clip view.


1008
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,726
You don't know where we're
going to, what the new size


1009
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:06,696
of the clip view is going to be.


1010
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:09,016
So you can't give us an
appropriately constrained scroll


1011
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,806
point and your content isn't
centered like you want it to be.


1012
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:14,366
So we've deprecated
constrainScrollPoint


1013
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,616
and we've replaced it
with constrainBoundsRect.


1014
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,086
We'll go ahead and
pass in a complete rect


1015
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:22,676
so that you have what we want
the proposed new size to be


1016
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:24,326
and you can constrain
that hopefully,


1017
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:25,846
all you're changing
is the origin.


1018
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:29,806
But now, as the user
pinches and go


1019
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:31,996
and pass the minimum
allowed size so that we need


1020
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:35,156
to bounce back, when they
let go, we'll animate


1021
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:36,786
to the appropriate
centered position.


1022
00:46:37,456 --> 00:46:40,446
So, for those of you that
are overriding clip views,


1023
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,426
please add constrainBoundsRect
and override


1024
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,346
that in your application.


1025
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:48,676
So in conclusion, we covered
a lot in this session.


1026
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,966
We talked about optimizing
your AppKit drawing


1027
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:55,486
and layer-backed drawing
and optimizing that and some


1028
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:56,776
of the performance
characteristics


1029
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:58,136
with layer-backed drawing.


1030
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,266
These are still very important
with responsive scrolling


1031
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:06,036
as you've seen, it can get
over a lot of rough edges and--


1032
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:08,496
that the main thread might
be doing and be responsive


1033
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:12,456
to the user and that is
a tremendous advantage


1034
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,186
for your application as you've
seen in that demo application,


1035
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:16,296
it can make a huge difference.


1036
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:18,346
However, it's not
a silver bullet,


1037
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:21,896
so make sure your drawing is as
fast as possible at all times.


1038
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,966
So all-- everything that
we said at the beginning


1039
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,426
of this talk is very important.


1040
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,346
And we've also covered
magnification


1041
00:47:28,656 --> 00:47:29,846
and how we've made
some changes there


1042
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,756
to make it a little bit more
responsive even though it's


1043
00:47:31,756 --> 00:47:32,886
still main thread driven.


1044
00:47:34,636 --> 00:47:36,846
For more information, there's--


1045
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:39,296
you can see our App
Frameworks Evangelist Jake


1046
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:41,376
and we have the documentation


1047
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:45,266
in particular the Core Animation
Programming Guide has got some


1048
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,606
really nice information there


1049
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:48,906
for when you're making
your views layer-backed


1050
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:49,676
and doing animations.


1051
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:52,896
The Developer Forums and I
didn't get a chance to put


1052
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,056
on the slide but make sure
you read the release notes,


1053
00:47:55,316 --> 00:47:58,706
we cover a lot of details and
everything I've talked here


1054
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:04,256
in the release notes as it
relates to responsive scrolling.


1055
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,176
The Best Practices
for Cocoa Animation


1056
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:11,336
which actually just occurred
right before this one,


1057
00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:13,036
but if you haven't seen
that one yet, please go back


1058
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:15,856
and watch the video, it's
another great session that you--


1059
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:17,436
that relates to responsive
scrolling


1060
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:17,976
and animating your views.


1061
00:48:19,056 --> 00:48:19,976
And that's it for
responsive scrolling.


1062
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:21,966
Thank you guys for coming out.


1063
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:22,976
I hope you enjoy the
rest of the show.


1064
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:28,430
[Applause]
