3
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:31,176
>> Hi, I'm Caroline
Cranfill and I'm a designer


4
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,276
and production manager
here at Apple.


5
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:37,546
Today, I'm excited to talk
to you about some principles


6
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,446
about inclusive design.


7
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:43,776
When you put so much hard work
and creativity into an app,


8
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,576
you really want it
to reach people.


9
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:50,586
But ultimately, everyone
will experience your app


10
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:54,466
in their own way and if you
think about the millions


11
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,666
of people who could
use your app,


12
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:59,956
you have to consider how
diverse their perspectives are.


13
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,176
Some people are just learning
how to interact with technology.


14
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:10,946
Others are digital natives
who are completely comfortable


15
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,846
with the latest and greatest.


16
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,906
And there's some who are just
trying to get comfortable


17
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:18,466
with the new way to communicate.


18
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,466
And some will have
cultural backgrounds


19
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,136
that are very different
from yours.


20
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:28,946
And some will interact with your
app with assistive technology


21
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,946
like a Bluetooth
Braille Display.


22
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,516
So when you're trying to
ship an app, it always feels


23
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:38,786
like there isn't enough time and
there aren't enough resources


24
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,856
and it only gets worse the
closer you get to the end.


25
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,726
So that's why it's important to
plan to make your app inclusive


26
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,656
as early as possible in
the development cycle.


27
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:52,896
The problem is that early in
the cycle, everyone just wants


28
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,506
to talk about the cool
feature ideas they have.


29
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,106
So you need to convince your
team to do the right thing.


30
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,796
And here are some statistics
that will persuade them


31
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,736
to make inclusiveness
a high level feature.


32
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,606
Tim Cook recently announced
that 67 percent of Apple sales


33
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:13,906
in the second quarter
were international.


34
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:17,166
Your app needs to be
inclusive and flexible


35
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:21,026
to reach this huge market of
people with diverse backgrounds.


36
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:29,046
Worldwide, 285 million people
are blind or have low vision.


37
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,076
That's like half the
population of North America.


38
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:38,556
Over one billion people live
with some kind of disability.


39
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:42,256
That's one out of every
seven people on the planet.


40
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,916
Now disability and diversity
may not be the first things you


41
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,616
think about when you think
about user experience.


42
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,196
But these numbers make it
clear, these are the people


43
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:57,396
that use your app and creating
designs that work for them is


44
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:59,506
at the heart of the
user experience.


45
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:04,286
So, how can you make
your apps more inclusive?


46
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:08,376
Fortunately, there are a
small number of key principles


47
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,316
that I have found to be helpful.


48
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:14,286
If you incorporate these
principles into your process,


49
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:17,556
you will have more informed
designs from the beginning.


50
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:21,216
And in the end, your app
will not only work better


51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,096
for more people, but
you may also save time


52
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,456
on localization and QA.


53
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,086
So today, I'm going
to share some concepts


54
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,366
that I found eye opening and now
keep in mind when I'm designing.


55
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:36,616
I'll discuss how to use
typography to maintain hierarchy


56
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,076
in different localizations.


57
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:42,016
I'll show you why layouts
need to be dynamically built


58
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,006
to accommodate translation
lengths,


59
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,216
screen sizes and dynamic type.


60
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:50,996
And we'll discuss emotions
and legibility considerations


61
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,076
when making design
choices with color.


62
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,986
And we'll go over certain
cultural sensitivities


63
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,966
around iconography.


64
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:08,386
So first, we'll talk about
the need impactful typography


65
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,806
for everyone regardless
of language.


66
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:14,846
Because the most fundamental
objective of app design is


67
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,786
to communicate information
clearly


68
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,106
and we largely do
that with typography.


69
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:22,576
So let's look at a quick
design exercise together.


70
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:27,276
One of the ways you know
what is most important is


71
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,546
by using basic typographic
treatments


72
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:33,106
and compositional elements to
give visual cues of hierarchy.


73
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:37,486
You can use extra space between
different pieces of information


74
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,726
or try different font sizes.


75
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:45,636
Or you can explore typographic
styles like font weights


76
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:51,176
or character styles like
capitalization or italics.


77
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:55,546
Or start adding color
and before you know it,


78
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,236
you have so many good options.


79
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,736
And at this stage, it's
an excellent opportunity


80
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:05,156
to preview your favorite options
in other languages you are going


81
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:08,276
to localize in because
you want all localizations


82
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,326
to have this same impact
as your original intention.


83
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:15,546
In this example, the hierarchy
isn't as strong in the title


84
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,976
and subtitle of the
Chinese localization


85
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,346
because the Chinese writing
system doesn't have the concept


86
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,796
of upper and lowercase.


87
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:28,606
In the second design, the title
additionally has a larger font


88
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,836
size and color from the subtitle


89
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,696
which helps maintain a
clear hierarchy in Chinese.


90
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,536
So out of my two favorites,


91
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,856
this second design is
the most robust choice


92
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,456
because it creates hierarchy


93
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,626
through using two
typographic treatments,


94
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,466
both localizations can support,
which is font size and color.


95
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:51,556
I've found that once a design
is going to be translated


96
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,716
into multiple languages,
having two to three levels


97
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:57,286
of change will be
more inclusive just


98
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,216
in case a treatment isn't
applicable in certain languages.


99
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,396
And sometimes, designing
with constraints


100
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,166
like these can help come up
with a better end solution


101
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:06,876
for everyone.


102
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:10,156
Here's another example
at Airbnb.


103
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:15,006
They use font size, color, and
extra space between information


104
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,806
to maintain hierarchy
across localizations.


105
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:22,766
And so now for you to have
more background knowledge


106
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,436
and feel informed to
design for other languages,


107
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:29,086
I want to dive a little
deeper about a few topics.


108
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,466
First, it's important to
remember that around the world,


109
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:36,616
we speak different languages
and use different alphabets.


110
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,826
So, I want to introduce
you to some writing systems


111
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,436
that you may not
be familiar with


112
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:44,946
and how hierarchy can be
lost if you aren't aware


113
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,116
of their typographic support.


114
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,486
So everyone here knows this
writing system called Latin.


115
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,286
But you may not be
familiar with characters


116
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,056
in the extended Latin
character set such as these.


117
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,716
And you really might
not be familiar


118
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,476
with all ten writing
systems that are used


119
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,906
in over forty languages or
localizations that we ship.


120
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:09,786
A few typographic things that
you might not be aware of is


121
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:12,846
that some writing systems do
not have the concept of upper


122
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:14,726
and lowercase as I
mentioned earlier.


123
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,176
Also, the same subset does
not have an italic appearance


124
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,306
and it's not in good
practice to force a slant


125
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:24,576
on these writing systems.


126
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:29,396
So now you need to know
that different fonts


127
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:32,306
for these writing systems
have different numbers


128
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,286
of font weights.


129
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,606
Currently these are
the font weights


130
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:39,256
in the system font,
San Francisco.


131
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:43,616
But you can see that the system
fonts for all writing systems


132
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,826
at the moment do not have the
same number of font weights.


133
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:52,156
So this means your designs using
extreme weights may fall back


134
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:52,966
to the reduced set.


135
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,336
And this can be unexpected


136
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,496
and sometimes lose
hierarchy or emphasis.


137
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:01,506
In the next consideration,
I would like to talk


138
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:05,306
about is using larger text sizes
because they are more universal


139
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,776
between languages and
user capabilities.


140
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,646
So let's start with
a good question


141
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,056
which is, "What is too small?"


142
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,516
Maybe everyone here can
see this bottom letter


143
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,656
on this enormous screen.


144
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,996
But on a smaller device,
it'll be too hard to read.


145
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,766
Legibility is really
going to depend


146
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,586
on what device you are targeting


147
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,246
because the standard viewing
distances are different.


148
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:30,676
But, even if the
letters are legible,


149
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,716
it doesn't mean it's going to
be good for reading content.


150
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,366
Let's look at a non-Latin
writing system like Chinese.


151
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,535
It gets harder to read
at a higher number


152
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,816
because rendering dense writing
systems too small can reduce the


153
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,156
clarity of letter forms.


154
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,236
The meaning can be
misconstrued or lost


155
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,856
because the strokes
blend together.


156
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:57,156
You want people to read their
content easily and effortlessly.


157
00:08:57,596 --> 00:09:01,206
So leaning toward larger font
sizes will make the content more


158
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,346
readable for everyone.


159
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,516
Now one more thing
about typography.


160
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:10,386
Some writing systems are
considered to be tall


161
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,616
because they have
tall letter forms.


162
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,736
As you might have noticed in
the writing system overview,


163
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:19,586
some of the examples
have extra marks


164
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,936
that we don't use in English.


165
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,646
These are call diacritics,
vowel marks, or tone marks


166
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,406
and sometimes they're
extremely high or low.


167
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,956
For example, in this Thai font
it can have ascenders much


168
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,616
higher than Latin characters.


169
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,986
And in these Arabic
and Hindi fonts,


170
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:41,426
they have descenders much
lower than Latin characters.


171
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,046
And you should also be aware


172
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,416
that in some code
implementations,


173
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,566
characters that draw
outside those ascender


174
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,876
and descender boundaries
of a font


175
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,456
and text views can
be cut off if clip


176
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,316
to bounds is true for the label.


177
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,976
This should be off,
because this is bad.


178
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:04,916
Missing marks can change the
meaning of the word entirely.


179
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:08,736
So, also in design comps,


180
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:11,646
you should avoid assuming
fixed heights for texts


181
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,956
because the letter
form is going to vary


182
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,136
in different writing systems.


183
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,386
So you might be thinking how
does this affect my layouts?


184
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,226
So let me show you
a quick example


185
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:23,496
of how labels will
adjust automatically


186
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,676
for these tall writing
systems and code.


187
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,306
If you look at this
composition consisting


188
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,326
of three separate
Latin text-size labels,


189
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:35,756
and you can see in a tall
writing system it requires a


190
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:38,096
larger line height
to avoid clipping.


191
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,236
And here they are, side by side.


192
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:44,536
And you can see that Thai text
is longer and it's been allowed


193
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:45,916
to expand appropriately.


194
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:49,546
And it's important that you
don't restrict the height


195
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:52,066
of the view so this
expansion can happen


196
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:55,406
because letter forms could
overlap or be illegible.


197
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,966
And later, we'll explain how to
make further make these spaces


198
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,346
between labels increase
dynamically


199
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,836
to accommodate dynamic type.


200
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:07,956
So some things to remember
about typography that you need


201
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:11,996
to make sure designs will retain
the same meaningful purpose


202
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,786
in other languages by
preserving hierarchy,


203
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,756
by choosing universal character
styles, or by having two


204
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:22,026
to three levels of change
in case one isn't applicable


205
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,306
in one of the localizations.


206
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,366
Use font sizes that will
be easy to read across all


207
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,686
of your localizations and
capabilities of the people


208
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:34,006
who will use your app.


209
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:37,636
And don't restrict drawing of
views to their bounding boxes.


210
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,866
So now we've looked at a
little bit of typography.


211
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:44,316
For more information about
typography, be sure to check


212
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:47,266
out my friend Antonio's
session tomorrow morning called


213
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,966
Typography and Fonts
for even more details


214
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,626
on typographic treatments
and layout considerations.


215
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,696
But now, let's talk
about dynamic layouts.


216
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:01,506
We've talked about the
appearance of words from all


217
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:02,996
over the world, but
now let's talk


218
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:05,446
about how they come
together in layouts.


219
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,616
An Auto Layout can really
help you implement these


220
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,446
considerations, but I'm
not going to go into detail


221
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,286
about Auto Layout
in this session.


222
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:18,126
I want to focus on why having
flexibly built layouts helps


223
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,996
on so many different levels.


224
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,096
It helps with localization,


225
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:26,256
adapting to different screen
sizes and for visual impairments


226
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:27,696
when type is able to scale.


227
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:31,296
So first, let's see how
dynamic layouts help


228
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:33,006
with varying translation
lengths.


229
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,386
As crazy it sounds, the
shorter the English words are,


230
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,766
the longer the translations
are going to be.


231
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,746
The word edit in English
is four characters


232
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,896
but in Russian, it's
twice the size.


233
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,876
Just kidding, it's
thirteen characters long.


234
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,116
If an English word is less
than ten characters long,


235
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,986
the translation can be
three times longer or more.


236
00:12:56,606 --> 00:13:01,316
A seemingly concise English
phrase may be two times longer


237
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:02,316
in another language.


238
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:09,056
And an English sentence
can be 1.3 times or longer


239
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,116
and might need to
wrap to more lines.


240
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:15,966
So this variation
means that the amount


241
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,256
of maximum text lines should
not be strictly defined


242
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,516
and text should be
allowed to reflow


243
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,296
by having a flexible layout.


244
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,866
You need to allow enough space
for translations to expand,


245
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,156
especially if there's no other
place to see the words in full.


246
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,296
You would hate for the end


247
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:37,506
of a very important
message to be lost.


248
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:42,436
Titles and other key texts
of apps must not be truncated


249
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:46,746
because it can lose meaning
or functionality of the app.


250
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,836
So those expansion
stats were eye-opening


251
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,436
and I hope it is for you too.


252
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:55,526
I can't stress enough that
layouts need to be overspecified


253
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:58,096
for what you aren't
seeing in the language


254
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,156
that you are designing in.


255
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:01,616
Let me show you an example


256
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,736
of a dynamic layout
using Auto Layout --


257
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,216
looks like in a few
different languages.


258
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,726
Here's this What's
New in Photos screen


259
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,156
that was created
at Speed Dynamic.


260
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,016
In Chinese, it's actually
shorter than English


261
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,406
and in German it's much longer


262
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:21,516
and would start a Scroll
View on an iPhone SE.


263
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,416
And here is Thai with
the tall letter forms


264
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,526
and extra line height.


265
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:32,296
And here's Arabic which is also
tall and a right-to-left layout.


266
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:37,116
It's best to look at each
screen after implementation


267
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,816
in each language that
you're going to localize


268
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,776
in so you aren't
missing something


269
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,486
that will create
a bad experience.


270
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,976
Accommodating translation
should be the next step


271
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,786
into making your app inclusive


272
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,926
and it will have
immediate thank you


273
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:53,126
from the people who
use your app.


274
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:57,226
But I have one more reason
why you need dynamic layouts,


275
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,076
and that's Dynamic Type.


276
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:03,146
This feature might be one of
the most important features


277
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:05,906
that you could add to your
app if you haven't already.


278
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,736
In settings, you have the
ability to scale text.


279
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:14,196
This enables a broad audience to
personalize their devices and be


280
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,466
in control of their
own legibility.


281
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,276
But it also allows them


282
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,316
to choose how they
consume information.


283
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,056
Small text sizes may
produce dense content.


284
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:27,086
And larger text sizes
could be more focused.


285
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,916
This is a highly used feature.


286
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,466
In fact, who here uses a text
size feature on their devices?


287
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:37,976
Nice. So let's get
a great consistent


288
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,576
across all of our apps.


289
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,916
And you also might not be aware,
but in accessibility settings,


290
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:48,176
low vision people can get even
larger sizes for body copy.


291
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:51,176
And here is Ulysses.


292
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,286
They do a great job scaling
their UIs dynamically.


293
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:01,456
So, how do I specify a
design to be dynamic?


294
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:05,926
First you start by specifying
different text styles


295
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,896
for semantically distinct blocks
of text such as title, headline,


296
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:13,106
body, etc. for the platform
you're developing for.


297
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,606
This gives ample variety to
achieve a nice layout hierarchy


298
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,166
and today I've got a
present for all of you


299
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,776
when making designs
with text styles.


300
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,806
The font size, leading,
and tracking values


301
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,836
for each style is now published


302
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,866
on the iOS Human
Interface Guidelines


303
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,506
in the typography section.


304
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:34,956
And you will be able to download
a working Photoshop file.


305
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:40,916
[ Applause ]


306
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,446
Okay, so, let's go into detail,


307
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,346
I'm focused for a
minute on an iOS example.


308
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,796
These are the font styles
at the sizes they appear


309
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,996
at for the default
text size setting.


310
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:56,746
When the user slides the
slider smaller and larger,


311
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,506
these other columns
are the sizes


312
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:02,196
that the fonts will appear at.


313
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,826
You can see how the font sizes
get smaller and larger, both up


314
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,386
and down in text
styles, and left to right


315
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:09,766
in the text size slider.


316
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:13,476
And here's an iOS
10 mail message.


317
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,816
And I'm going to show you some
behind-the-scenes information


318
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,915
about how to use text styles
to make this design dynamic.


319
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,796
First, you will need to assign
a text style to each text area.


320
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:28,256
The sender and the subject
are the most important labels


321
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,156
and will be headlined so
they're prominent and bold.


322
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,766
The To field and the time stamp
are less important details


323
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,006
and will be subhead.


324
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:40,826
And then the message
body will be body.


325
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,676
Then the next step,
you will need


326
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:47,296
to add a baseline measurement
to express the relationship


327
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,296
of each label to other
elements around it.


328
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:54,426
And in the dynamic type
APIs, you'll use these values


329
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:58,406
to create a ratio to scale
the spaces proportionately


330
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,906
to the font size as it changes.


331
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,886
These are not fixed
baseline-to-baseline


332
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:04,476
measurements.


333
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,696
The bottom space under
the type also needs


334
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,726
to be specified dynamically


335
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,996
so that the text cluster will
remain vertically centered


336
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:18,306
in the header and the
other measurements will


337
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,146
follow similarly.


338
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:22,506
The next step, you'll specify


339
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,046
or enforce the standard
layout margins.


340
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,906
It's important to at least use
the standard width from UIKit


341
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,266
because the actual value is
different on different devices.


342
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:36,776
You want to be consistent
with other apps.


343
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,926
And lastly, we'll
add some padding


344
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,636
between horizontal elements.


345
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:44,506
So now together, with the
text styles, baseline ratios,


346
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,166
margins, and padding,
the layout is ready


347
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,366
to be coded dynamically.


348
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,646
And so now, let's watch
this design scale.


349
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:57,426
So, ta-da, this is the
mail message screen,


350
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,576
growing from large to
extra, extra large.


351
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,686
There's also another legibility
feature that you will get


352
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:07,366
for free if you use text styles
and that's called bold text.


353
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:11,586
This helps people who would
otherwise have a difficult time


354
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,006
reading lightweight fonts.


355
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:16,056
And additionally,
it also adjusts


356
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,406
for tall writing systems.


357
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:23,456
So sometimes, with the 12.9-inch
iPad Pro, paragraphs of texts,


358
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:27,156
or large blocks of texts,
can often appear too wide


359
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,396
for the reading experience


360
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,096
if the layout margins were
coded as fixed values.


361
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,546
So when you're reading
a long line length,


362
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,886
it's hard for your
eye to jump back


363
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,416
to the beginning
of the next line.


364
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:44,486
So in iOS 9, we introduced the
readable content guide property


365
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:48,766
of UIView to respect a suitable
line length for reading based


366
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,646
on the size of the font


367
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,286
which makes the margins
dynamic instead of fixed.


368
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,796
And now, so the margins adjust


369
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,976
when the text size
setting changes.


370
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,856
This way, the line
length remains favorable


371
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,526
for each font size.


372
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,686
Also, layouts need
to be further dynamic


373
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:11,506
for right-to-left writing
systems such as Arabic


374
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,366
and Hebrew because they
read from the right side


375
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:15,296
of the screen to the left.


376
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:20,016
These languages require
the UI to be mirrored.


377
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:20,626
Here's Tweetbot.


378
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:24,156
They've done a great job at
their right-to-left layout.


379
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:28,326
If using Auto Layout's leading
and trailing attributes,


380
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,986
the flow and elements
will easily mirror.


381
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,496
However, it's important
to make sure


382
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,146
that some things do not mirror.


383
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:36,916
Like numerals.


384
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,536
They are presented
left-to-right even in the middle


385
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,266
of right-to-left phrases.


386
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:51,026
You should not mirror phone
numbers, clocks, music notes,


387
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:56,246
graphs, and video
playback controls.


388
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:59,916
Video progress sliders
still increase from the left


389
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,616
to the right and rewind always
points the triangles facing left


390
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,066
and fast-forward to the right.


391
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:09,796
And images do not need to be
mirrored unless there is a sense


392
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:12,956
of direction or design
composition elements tying


393
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,776
to other parts of
the user interface.


394
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:18,056
So now let's internationalize
an example together


395
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,216
so you can see how this
all comes together.


396
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:24,846
Here's a step one, two,
three, and an onboarding flow


397
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:25,936
in a hypothetical app.


398
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,106
If we were going
to localize this


399
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:31,276
for right-to-left languages,
first we would mirror steps one


400
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,896
through three with step
one starting on the right.


401
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,856
And then of course,
translate the text and numbers


402
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:41,266
by making them localizable
labels instead


403
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,676
of being baked into the art.


404
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:47,206
But here, the story of the
images seems to be pointing


405
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,656
in the opposite direction
as the numbered steps.


406
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,246
So we would want to mirror each
image separately so the story


407
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,166
of the images follows the steps.


408
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,666
However, we should not
mirror the checkmark


409
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:03,606
because checkmarks
are written the same.


410
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:06,546
And now, the onboarding
flow would feel natural


411
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,086
for right-to-left languages.


412
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:13,166
So some things to remember
about dynamic type is


413
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,686
that translation lengths are
going to vary, both shorter


414
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:20,536
and longer, than the
language you are designing in.


415
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,826
Dynamic Type is an
awesome, highly used feature


416
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,186
that allows scalable type.


417
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,586
And reability margins help
keep columns and areas of type


418
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,726
at nice readable line lengths.


419
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,766
And Arabic and Hebrew will
require the UI to mirror.


420
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,806
So now we've looked
at dynamic layouts


421
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,776
and I hope your apps
will look great


422
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,616
to these size changes
and new languages.


423
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:46,176
There are new additions to the
APIs that will make it easier


424
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,076
to implement, so check out
these other great talks


425
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,106
for more information.


426
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,166
The Auditing Your App


427
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,526
for Accessibility
highlights a new tool


428
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:57,696
for previewing your app using
the Dynamic Type settings


429
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:02,036
and Making Apps Adaptive, Part
2, will give you a summary


430
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:05,496
of the new Dynamic Type
APIs and What's New


431
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:08,376
in International User Interfaces
highlights new support


432
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,116
for handling right-to-left
images with asset catalogs.


433
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:14,726
But now, let's talk about color.


434
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:20,506
Color is another
fundamental design element.


435
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:23,746
There's a -- and there's a lot
to consider when choosing colors


436
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:26,666
for your app because
they will bring emotions


437
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:27,696
to the experience.


438
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,126
So first, it's important


439
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,126
to recognize what
emotions colors will mean


440
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:36,246
to your particular
audience in your context.


441
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:38,696
So let's talk about
a few meanings


442
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,666
of the three most
popular colors.


443
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,916
Surveys have told us that blue
might be considered the most


444
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:46,736
favored color around the world.


445
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,596
And the second most popular
color varies in countries


446
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,506
but is usually green or red.


447
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,206
So first let's talk about blue.


448
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,496
Why does everybody
like blue so much?


449
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:03,656
I mean, blue has a short
wavelength on the spectrum


450
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,606
and actually makes it
less work on us to see.


451
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,606
And our eyes are trained to
see the skies as generally blue


452
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:13,746
because the short wavelengths
are scattered more efficiently


453
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:14,516
by the molecules.


454
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,516
FYI, that's why the sky's blue.


455
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,926
But also seeing some colors
releases calming chemicals


456
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:24,486
in your body and lowers
the blood pressure.


457
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:27,336
However, universally,


458
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,236
some shades of blue
also portray sadness


459
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,206
and loneliness likely
stemming from an association


460
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,056
with the vast and
ominous oceans.


461
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:38,576
So now, let's talk about green.


462
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:42,246
It has a wide range of
symbolic associations.


463
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:46,426
In the western cultures, it's
heavily marketed as go green,


464
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:49,226
live healthy, and
reduce, reuse, recycle,


465
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:52,046
as a natural eco-friendly
way of life.


466
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:56,626
In Ireland, green commemorates
the Patron Saint of Ireland


467
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:57,636
on Saint Patrick's Day


468
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,966
and is also known throughout
the world as a lucky color.


469
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:04,776
Green is also a universal
color for safety.


470
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:08,686
It's used in traffic light
systems and road signs all


471
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:11,376
over the world to indicate
that it is safe to proceed.


472
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:14,936
So now, let's talk about red.


473
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:18,126
It's pretty consistent around
the world that it stirs


474
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,986
up both similar positive
and negative meanings.


475
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:25,016
Red has a long wavelength
on the spectrum


476
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:27,496
which grabs our attention
easily.


477
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:32,336
Therefore, in many parts of
the world, red is a symbol


478
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:34,106
of revolution and conflict.


479
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:38,156
It exudes passion and love.


480
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,286
And to most Asian cultures, red
means happiness, prosperity,


481
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:46,006
and good luck because
of the association


482
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:46,936
with the Lunar New Year.


483
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,496
And it's also worn at weddings.


484
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:52,516
In fact, red is so
positive here,


485
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:56,786
that the Chinese stock
market uses red to mean gains


486
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:58,276
and green to mean losses.


487
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:04,416
And the next color consideration
is color blindness.


488
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,256
And you need to be aware


489
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:09,156
that color blindness affects
more people than you think.


490
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:13,706
It's actually one in 12
men and one in 200 women.


491
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,726
That's almost 5 percent


492
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,716
of the total population
of the whole world.


493
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,106
And all of these popular
preferred colors have


494
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:24,056
implications to color
blind people.


495
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,206
It's not that these are --


496
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:30,106
these colors are confused with
each other, but it's how much


497
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,936
of blue, red, and green
they have difficulty seeing


498
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:33,826
in all colors.


499
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,356
For one kind of color blindness,


500
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:39,226
this color palette may
look similar to this.


501
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,646
This is why our platforms
have settings


502
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:46,176
to differentiate key information
without color if needed.


503
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,706
Like here in mail
settings, you have the choice


504
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:54,266
between an orange dot or an
orange flag for mail flagging


505
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,766
because if you are color
blind, you may not be able


506
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,796
to tell the difference from
the orange flagging dot


507
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:02,086
with the blue and red dot.


508
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:06,216
So the additional shape option
is good for people who need it.


509
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:12,056
And the next topic is about
having high-color contrasts


510
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,766
for legibility between
backgrounds and text.


511
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:18,566
Contrast is important
to test in your apps


512
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:22,036
because you want people who
may have contrast sensitivities


513
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:25,746
as well as situational
impairments like bright sunlight


514
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,556
or wearing sunglasses to
be able to use your app.


515
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:31,166
And to find what
is high contrast,


516
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,176
you need to calculate
the luminosity ratio


517
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,906
between two colors or one way
of roughly testing contrast


518
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:42,866
without calculation is to
turn your file into grayscale.


519
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:47,236
You can quickly see if the
colors will have enough contrast


520
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,976
with each other in your app.


521
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:52,606
And soon, on the iOS
Human Interface Guidelines


522
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,636
in the resources
section, you'll be able


523
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:57,956
to download a helpful tool
to calculate color contrast


524
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:02,166
by using RGB values and it
will also tell you if you're


525
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,786
in compliance with common
accessibility guidelines


526
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,366
for different text
sizes and weights.


527
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,766
But you can also use
numerous online contrast


528
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:10,946
ratio calculators.


529
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,236
If we calculate the contrast
ratio for this purple


530
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,396
and orange, it was
found to be 1.5 to 1.


531
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:21,066
That is not in compliance
with --


532
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:23,226
because it is a very low ratio.


533
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:28,306
In fact, 1 to 1 is the
lowest ratio you can have.


534
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:29,946
Let's look at another example


535
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:31,986
to see the highest
contrast possible,


536
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,176
and that's between
black and white.


537
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:37,696
A contrast ratio calculator
finds that the white


538
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,446
and black has a ratio of 21 to 1


539
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:45,036
and of course it passes
at all text sizes.


540
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:47,936
Now let's check out some gray
text since it's such a fad.


541
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,796
The ratio comes in at
4.4 to 1 for this gray.


542
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:55,226
It's okay for large font sizes,


543
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,826
but it's too low for
small text sizes.


544
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:01,886
When font sizes are small
and have low contrast,


545
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:05,196
your eyes can't distinguish
the shape of the letter forms


546
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,596
to easily read the text.


547
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,376
Let's look at one more gray.


548
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,726
Maybe not on this screen,
but on small devices,


549
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:16,486
this is really hard to
see, even at large sizes.


550
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:20,176
That's because the
contrast ratio is 1.9 to 1.


551
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,656
And this fails at
all text sizes.


552
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:26,006
You wouldn't want your
app to have text or glyphs


553
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:29,836
at this low contrast if
you want people to see


554
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,676
and be able to use it.


555
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:35,336
Ideally gray text should be
reserved to indicate disabled


556
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:41,216
or inactive states rather than
ornamental or decorative style.


557
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:43,706
Now, have you ever debated
whether you should use white


558
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,776
text or black text on
a color background?


559
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,076
Happens to me all the time.


560
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:51,026
If we use this calculator,
we can see that white text


561
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,786
on an orange button is a
2.2 to 1 contrast ratio.


562
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:58,686
And black text on an
orange button is 9.6 to 1.


563
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:03,056
So in this particular example,
choose black on orange.


564
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,416
It's a higher ratio.


565
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:08,416
Your texts and glyph colors
should be in good contrast


566
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,976
to the background color for
optimal reading experience.


567
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,186
So some things to
remember about color,


568
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,186
some of the most popular colors
can mean different things


569
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:19,946
around the world.


570
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,196
Additionally, you should
not rely solely on color


571
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:27,426
to show the difference
between similar shaped objects


572
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:28,786
that have different meanings.


573
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:33,076
And you need a high color
contrast between text


574
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,736
and backgrounds for legibility.


575
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,536
And so now we've
looked at color.


576
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,706
Let's talk about iconography.


577
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:44,626
It's important for you to know


578
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,926
that iconography can
have different meanings


579
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:47,726
around the world too.


580
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,276
Semiotics shows us
that the language


581
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,796
of visible symbols is
audience and context dependent


582
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:58,736
and how cultural references
and values shape the message.


583
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:01,936
For example, to be -- in
order to be multicultural,


584
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:05,646
the International Red Cross
has three official symbols


585
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:07,066
for protection during conflict.


586
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,526
They have the red cross for
predominantly Christian regions,


587
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:13,256
the red crescent
for Muslim regions,


588
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,246
and the red crystal
as a neutral symbol.


589
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:20,566
These religious connotations
of these simple symbols,


590
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,886
risk the safety of people in
conflict, so they adopted three.


591
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,716
So, when you design glyphs
and icons, it's important


592
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,486
to remember that different areas


593
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:31,946
of the world might
associate meaning


594
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,706
with even the simplest
of shapes.


595
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:37,636
Something as simple as a hand
can have different meanings


596
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:38,246
around the world.


597
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:43,026
In most places, it means stop or
requesting a cheerful high five.


598
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:47,096
But in Hinduism and Buddhism,
it's the hand position


599
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,256
of Abhaya and it means no fear.


600
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:54,076
However, maybe you wanted to
make a simple design decision


601
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:57,716
to spread out the fingers
of a palm for better clarity


602
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,606
in a glyph, but an open,


603
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,996
facing palm is actually
offensive in some countries.


604
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,886
And I'm not going to
show you that one today.


605
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:11,156
Additionally, non-directional
and non-textual icons are going


606
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:14,636
to be more universal
because it does not rely


607
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,466
on one region's alphabet


608
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:19,256
or particular cultural
objects' orientation.


609
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:22,966
For example, iBooks using
an open book instead


610
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:25,936
of a book showing the binding
which is going to be different


611
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,146
for right-to-left locals.


612
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:31,366
You don't want to alienate
a group of potential users


613
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,946
because they can't
recognize a letter form


614
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:37,626
or if something will
feel backward.


615
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,556
Also, sometimes you
create glyphs


616
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:40,896
that mimic other
parts of the UI.


617
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:44,336
For example, in right-to-left
settings,


618
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,776
the notification
icon is mirrored


619
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,726
to match the way it appears on
the right-to-left Home screen.


620
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,756
The badge should be on the left


621
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:54,526
of the glyph representing
a badged icon.


622
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:58,636
So some things to remember
about icons and glyphs,


623
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,866
iconography can conflict
with cultural norms


624
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,116
or symbols can have
different meanings entirely.


625
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:09,276
Iconography are ideally
non-directional and non-textual.


626
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:14,036
And iconography should match
UI if the UI was mirrored


627
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,286
for right-to-left languages.


628
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:19,956
You want the meaning of your
feature or app to be clear


629
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,536
and used, not offensive,
confusing and unused.


630
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:30,156
Okay, so we've looked at ways in
which your app's UI could change


631
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,276
to be more intuitive
and appropriate


632
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,296
for a culturally
diverse audience,


633
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,306
and in ways in which
your designs can be all


634
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,346
around more assessable
to everyone.


635
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:43,666
But it's a lot to consider and
sometimes it's hard to know


636
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,746
if you're doing something
that is insensitive.


637
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:49,996
So what I encourage you to
do is to reach out to people


638
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,946
in the countries you plan to
make your app available in


639
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,386
and ask them for feedback.


640
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:57,076
Ask them how they
were using your app.


641
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,946
If it feels logical
in their language?


642
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,266
Is everything easy to read?


643
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:03,756
And then I want you
to ask yourself,


644
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,906
"How can you be more inclusive?"


645
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:11,505
So to watch this talk again,
please check out this address


646
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,775
and to also find
related resources


647
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,085
for what I discussed today.


648
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,926
And it also has a link


649
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:20,866
to the completely redesigned
iOS Human Interface Guidelines.


650
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,755
It has been migrated to
a new visual layout style


651
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,766
with fresh imagery and
streamlined graphics


652
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,266
for designing great apps.


653
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,206
It's also been updated
to include guidance


654
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,505
on the new features in iOS 10.


655
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,186
Be sure to check out these
great related sessions happening


656
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:39,795
all week.


657
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:42,346
As I mentioned before,
the Typography


658
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,826
and Fonts tomorrow morning
has additional great design


659
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,176
information about
typography and fonts.


660
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,616
The Auditing Your Apps


661
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,966
for Accessibility
highlights the new tool


662
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,356
for previewing your
dynamic type.


663
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:58,296
And Making Apps Adaptive, Part
2 will go over layout guides,


664
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,916
readable content guides, assets
and appearance customization.


665
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,786
All information that
you will need to use


666
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,696
to put my considerations
into practice.


667
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,326
And the What's New


668
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:11,896
in International User Interfaces
highlights the new support


669
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,926
for handling the right-to-left
images with asset catalog.


670
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:16,976
Thank you and have
a great conference.
