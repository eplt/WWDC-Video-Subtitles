&gt;&gt;&gt;TIM COOK:
Good morning!

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle
Good morning!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.857 align:middle
Good morning.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.728 align:middle
Good morning.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.431 align:middle
Good morning!

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.869 align:middle
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.537 align:middle
And welcome to San Francisco.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.541 align:middle
Welcome to WWDC 2015.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.611 align:middle
Although we may not
have any -- thank you --

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle
high-flying trapeze acts, we
do have a lot of great things

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.417 align:middle
to talk about this morning.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.754 align:middle
This developer conference
continues to be the epicenter

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:58.825 align:middle
of change for not only
Apple, but the industry.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.195 align:middle
This is our 26th WWDC.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.195 align:middle
This is our 26th WWDC.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.799 align:middle
We have attendees today
from over 70 countries,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.369 align:middle
and 80 percent are here
for the very first time.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.908 align:middle
[Applause]

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:19.146 align:middle
This is our most
global conference ever.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:24.384 align:middle
And a special shout-out for
our 350 scholarship winners.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:31.858 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.827 align:middle
These guys are unbelievable.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.429 align:middle
I spent some time
with them yesterday.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.299 align:middle
Our youngest scholarship
winner is a 12-year-old girl

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.434 align:middle
from New York.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:43.904 align:middle
She is going to have a
fantastic future ahead.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:45.906 align:middle
[Applause]

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.408 align:middle
We've got over a hundred
sessions planned for you

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.411 align:middle
and over 150 labs so that
you can get your hands

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle
on our latest technologies.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.617 align:middle
And we've got over a thousand
Apple engineers to answer just

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.721 align:middle
about any question
that you might have.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.721 align:middle
about any question
that you might have.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle
Now, we've got a lot more
people that would have liked

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.891 align:middle
to have been here this
morning, but unfortunately,

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.794 align:middle
we just can't fit any
more in, as you can tell.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.697 align:middle
And so for the first time,

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.467 align:middle
we're not only live
streaming the Keynote,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.869 align:middle
but we are live streaming
30 sessions

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.438 align:middle
of the conference as well.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:24.311 align:middle
[Applause]

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.647 align:middle
Now, before we get right to
the show, I'd like to bring

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle
up something that I saw on
the news just a few days ago.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle
This is Brandon Moss of
the Cleveland Indians,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.692 align:middle
and he hit his 100th career
home run last Tuesday.

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.827 align:middle
Obviously, it's a huge milestone
if you are a baseball player.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.096 align:middle
Not a lot of people do this.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.098 align:middle
And you can imagine how much

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.235 align:middle
that ball would mean
to him to have it.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:52.606 align:middle
It turns out the ball was hit
into the Indians' bull pen,

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:57.044 align:middle
and his teammates decided to
play a bit of a prank on him.

00:02:57.044 --> 00:03:01.014 align:middle
They decided to hold
it for ransom.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.044 --> 00:03:01.014 align:middle
They decided to hold
it for ransom.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle
And this is the list of
things they asked for.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle
[Laughter] Apple Watches,
iPads, MacBook Airs, iPhones.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle
It's unbelievable.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.493 align:middle
It's a shopping list
for the Apple Store.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:19.633 align:middle
[Applause]

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.602 align:middle
Now, Brandon would have
had to raid an Apple Store

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.204 align:middle
to get that ball back.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.075 align:middle
That didn't seem quite right
to us, and so what we're going

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.344 align:middle
to do is we're going
to pay the ransom.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:37.517 align:middle
And I have the ball right here.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:45.525 align:middle
[Applause]

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle
We are giving the ball to
Brandon, and we are going

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:52.666 align:middle
to give everything his
teammates asked for to them

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.534 align:middle
so everybody is happy.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.604 align:middle
So congratulations, Brandon,
on a hundred home runs,

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.539 align:middle
and good luck on
the next hundred.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.778 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.778 align:middle
[Applause]

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.314 align:middle
Now, we've got a
jam-packed morning for you.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.316 align:middle
We are going to get
started with OS X.

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle
We are bringing a whole bunch

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:14.287 align:middle
of new great capabilities
to the Macintosh.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle
And next we've got a
great update for iOS,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.495 align:middle
the world's most advanced
mobile operating system.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:25.799 align:middle
And today we're bringing
native apps

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.568 align:middle
to the Watch with a new version.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:33.206 align:middle
[Applause]

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:36.309 align:middle
With a new version
of the watchOS,

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle
which gives the developers
even more time

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle
to create even greater
apps for the Watch

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.919 align:middle
that will change the world.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.589 align:middle
Now, all three of these
ecosystems together provide

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.026 align:middle
incredible opportunities
for developers

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle
and unbelievable
possibilities for users.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.832 align:middle
So we are very excited
about this.

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:01.334 align:middle
There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:01.334 align:middle
There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.503 align:middle
with my normal updates other

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:06.106 align:middle
than to tell you
everything's going great.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.108 align:middle
[Laughter]

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:12.078 align:middle
[Applause]

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle
And I'd like to bring
out my friend

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.551 align:middle
and colleague Craig Federighi to
take you through OS X and iOS.

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle
Craig.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.823 align:middle
[Applause]

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Good morning!

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.167 align:middle
It's fantastic to be
with you here at WWDC.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle
The team has been doing
some amazing work this year,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle
and I am thrilled to be able
to share it with you today.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle
We are going to start with OS X.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle
Now, our current release,
Yosemite, is a big, bold,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle
beautiful release
with a gorgeous new UI

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle
and breakthrough features like
Continuity that let you work

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle
across your devices
like never before.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.261 align:middle
Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.261 align:middle
Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle
In fact, over 55 percent

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle
of active Mac users are
running our latest update,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle
and this is just unprecedented
in the history of our industry.

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:15.909 align:middle
[Laughter] In fact, Yosemite
has the fastest adoption rate

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.245 align:middle
for any PC operating
system ever.

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.679 align:middle
So thank you.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:26.152 align:middle
[Applause]

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:29.856 align:middle
So for our next big release of
OS X, we knew we wanted to build

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.158 align:middle
on those strengths of Yosemite

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.362 align:middle
with some really great
refinements and advances.

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:39.799 align:middle
The only real question, of
course, was what to call it.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:45.639 align:start
So we had to once again turn to
our crack Apple Marketing Team.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.342 align:middle
Now, in typical California
fashion, they started

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.211 align:middle
with a project kickoff meeting.

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.013 align:middle
[Laughter]

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:56.483 align:middle
And then headed immediately
into a team building off site.

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:58.752 align:middle
[Laughter]

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle
Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle
Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.657 align:middle
Free-Bottom Fridays attire.

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.659 align:middle
They say it's all
part of their process.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.761 align:middle
I am not sure I get it.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.164 align:middle
Ultimately, this
didn't yield any names,

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.266 align:middle
so they called in a consultant.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.268 align:middle
[Laughter]

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:19.639 align:middle
He told them the answer
was to be found within.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.643 align:middle
Not within themselves,
but within Yosemite.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:29.749 align:middle
And so the new name for
OS X is OS X El Capitan.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle
[Applause]

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.761 align:middle
For El Capitan, we focused
in two major areas --

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.297 align:middle
experience and performance.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:48.435 align:middle
For experience, we've made
Spotlight more expressive,

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:51.805 align:middle
more powerful, and more
knowledgeable than ever.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.442 align:middle
We've made big enhancements
to the apps you use most,

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.478 align:middle
and we made some real great
advancements in the area

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.947 align:middle
of how you manage
windows on the system.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.947 align:middle
of how you manage
windows on the system.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.883 align:start
But rather than just talk about
it, I'd like to show it to you,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.786 align:middle
so let's start with
a demo right now.

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:11.424 align:middle
[Applause]

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.094 align:middle
Now, your first task, of
course, in a demonstration

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:17.097 align:middle
or whenever you wake your
Mac, is finding the cursor,

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.932 align:middle
and El Capitan makes
this easier than ever.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.835 align:middle
I just do that little
shake we all normally do,

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.669 align:middle
and there it is.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.603 align:middle
It comes right out to greet you.

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle
It's really handy.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:28.975 align:middle
[Applause]

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle
Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.212 align:middle
I am just going to
go here in Mail.

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:34.414 align:middle
I have a message here from Eddy.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:38.284 align:middle
Looks like -- well, now --
[Laughter] -- that's a keeper.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle
So I can actually mark
it unread to keep it just

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.358 align:middle
by swiping two fingers across
the trackpad just like that.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.428 align:middle
And this one I'd kind of like
to delete, so I am just going

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.096 align:middle
to swipe it away just like that.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.132 align:middle
So some real nice
little gestures.

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.267 align:middle
Let's move on now to Safari.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.303 align:middle
Now, in Safari, I have some
sites that I like to keep

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle
around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle
around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day,

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:05.945 align:middle
and now in Safari, I can pin
those sites just like this.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:08.982 align:middle
So there's -- I am going to
pin my Twitter site here.

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.284 align:middle
And of course I have been
following the Warriors.

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.353 align:middle
Go Warriors, we are
going to get it done.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:15.355 align:middle
[Applause]

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle
Just like that.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.092 align:middle
Now, Pinned Sites have a
lot of special properties.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:22.562 align:middle
For one, if I close this
window and reopen it,

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.098 align:middle
you see that my Pinned
Sites are all right there,

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.999 align:middle
and they load instantly.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle
Now, Pinned Sites also behave
differently when I follow links,

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.304 align:middle
so I am just going
to click on one here,

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:35.542 align:start
and you notice it opens in a new
tab, but my pinned site remains.

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:37.911 align:middle
Now I am going to open
up a couple more links.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.547 align:middle
This one, let's see, this one.

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.048 align:middle
I will take a quick look.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:44.284 align:middle
This one looks like some
kind of presentation video.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.518 align:middle
This one is about the Giants.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle
Have you ever had
this happen to you?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.256 align:middle
You are like, Where is
this audio coming from?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:54.294 align:middle
Now with just a tap,
you can mute it or find

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:58.898 align:middle
out where it came from and
shut it down just like that.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle
[Applause]

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.873 align:middle
So I am interested in
seeing this Giants game,

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.908 align:middle
and now Spotlight can
actually help me out there.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.744 align:middle
So I am just going to do a
search for the SF Giants,

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.948 align:middle
and we see right now I
get current game scores,

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.249 align:middle
upcoming games.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.518 align:middle
Looks like the game I want
to go to is on Friday,

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle
so I can just search
for weather on Friday.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.289 align:middle
See we get the weather.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle
We can even resize the Spotlight
panel and move it around.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.899 align:middle
I mean, there's innovation; huh?

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.735 align:middle
[Laughter] But I can also
express myself in my own words

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.205 align:middle
in Spotlight searches now, so
I can do things like slides

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle
from Brian, and you
see I find those there.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:45.278 align:middle
But how about slides from
Brian about El Capitan?

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.715 align:middle
You see, I find exactly what I
am looking for in my own words.

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle
Now, this works great
in other apps as well.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle
Let's try it out in Mail.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.421 align:middle
So I've been really busy, of
course, the last couple of days,

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle
so I have been getting a
little behind on my Mail.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.393 align:middle
I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.393 align:middle
I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle
but that I haven't
responded to yet.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:08.268 align:middle
So I am just going to say
"mail I ignored from Phil."

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.671 align:middle
[Laughter] There are a few,
but I will be getting back

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.108 align:middle
to him right after the show.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:19.712 align:middle
[Laughter] So next, of course,
it's great in the Finder

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:23.049 align:start
as well, so if I wanted to look
at documents that I was working

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:26.586 align:middle
on last year at this time,
I might say something like

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:31.858 align:middle
"documents I worked
on last June."

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.626 align:middle
And I find exactly
what I am looking for.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:36.296 align:middle
So this is really a
great way to search.

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.798 align:middle
Next I want to turn to window
management, so I am just going

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:40.934 align:middle
to run a script here that's
going to open up a whole bunch

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:43.436 align:middle
of windows to simulate kind
of what my desktop looks

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:46.639 align:middle
like after a day working on OS
X because it's a powerful system

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.207 align:middle
and we tend to have
a lot of things open.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle
OS X provides some great ways
to navigate your windows,

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle
and one of those
is Mission Control.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.951 align:middle
In El Capitan, we made
Mission Control smoother,

00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.485 align:middle
simpler, and faster than ever.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.388 align:middle
I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.388 align:middle
I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:05.124 align:middle
We get this gorgeous
overview of Mission Control.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.659 align:middle
I'll just bring forward Safari.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.262 align:middle
Let's do that again
and bring up Mail.

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.063 align:middle
Just like that.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.264 align:middle
Works really great.

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle
Of course, OS X provides
great tools also

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.768 align:middle
to organize your windows, and
one of those is Full Screen.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.104 align:middle
I am going to take this
window here full screen,

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.039 align:middle
and I am going to reply.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.775 align:middle
Looks like there's a
message here from Eddy.

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:26.379 align:middle
He says sorry about bailing
on the team dinner last night.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.716 align:middle
He was apparently
prepping for the Keynote.

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle
So that's understandable.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:35.221 align:middle
But it looks like, actually,
I just got a new mail

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:39.025 align:middle
from Jeff here, and now I can
just click away, and it hides,

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:41.894 align:middle
and then -- oh, hold on.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.296 align:middle
Busted, Eddy.

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:45.331 align:middle
So I think I'll just
drag this, actually,

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.568 align:middle
right into my Compose window,
it hops up automatically,

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:49.702 align:middle
and I can do it just like that.

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle
It's really great.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.175 align:middle
And I can even open up
tabs in Compose as well.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.543 align:middle
It's really handy.

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:02.081 align:middle
So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:02.081 align:middle
So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail.

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:08.087 align:middle
[Applause]

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.355 align:middle
Thank you.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.823 align:middle
Now, we've done something
totally new to El Capitan,

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.192 align:middle
and it's the ability
to work really easily

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.927 align:middle
on two windows side by side.

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:18.064 align:middle
So I am just going to click and
hold here on the green button.

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:21.768 align:middle
And you see it's
prompting me to pick a side.

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.036 align:middle
I will just drop it in.

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.038 align:middle
And you notice I get an expose
of all my other windows.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:28.107 align:middle
Let me pick the new News
app, just like that.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle
[Applause]

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.948 align:middle
Of course, I can
resize this window

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.483 align:middle
to style it just the way I want.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.418 align:middle
How about that blur?

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.586 align:middle
Again, innovation.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.389 align:middle
[Laughter] So, great
way to work.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.124 align:middle
Here I can drag links,
for instance,

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle
from Safari right in here.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.064 align:start
You notice in the new Notes app,
I get a beautiful graphical link

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:52.265 align:middle
that gives me a nice thumbnail

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.535 align:middle
that helps me identify
what I dragged in there.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:58.738 align:middle
I am going to drag
in some yurts.

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle
I think yurts, first
time mentioned

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle
I think yurts, first
time mentioned

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.375 align:middle
on the WWDC Keynote stage.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:03.543 align:middle
There you go.

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:04.677 align:middle
Got some yurts here.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:08.581 align:middle
Great way to work split screen.

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.651 align:middle
We've also provided a really
easy way to move windows

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:13.252 align:middle
into their own desktops.

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:15.655 align:start
So let me just take this window
here, I'm just going to drag it

00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:19.492 align:middle
up past the top of the screen,
and drop it in just like that.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:23.162 align:middle
So easy. I can also do this
to take a window full screen.

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.932 align:middle
So let's take Photos, just
drop it in right here,

00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:27.533 align:middle
I took it full screen.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.701 align:middle
Check this out.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:32.205 align:middle
I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.874 align:middle
and create a split
view just like that.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.176 align:middle
Totally awesome.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:40.613 align:middle
[Applause]

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.515 align:middle
And that is a quick look
at some improvements

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:46.185 align:middle
to the experience in El Capitan.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle
[Applause]

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.893 align:middle
So we saw in El Capitan
a powerful form of search

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.729 align:middle
in Spotlight that lets
you compose your searches

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.898 align:middle
in your own words.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.233 align:middle
It knows more than ever,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.233 align:middle
It knows more than ever,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:04.403 align:middle
can look up weather,
stocks, game scores.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:09.408 align:middle
We saw gestures, for instance,
just swiping to delete in Mail.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.711 align:middle
And, of course, pin
sites in Safari

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.881 align:middle
and the ability to
easily mute tabs.

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:17.617 align:middle
A great new Notes app that
supports text styling,

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle
checklists, and graphical links.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.688 align:middle
And better window
management than ever

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:26.759 align:middle
with a beautiful new
Mission Control interface,

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.962 align:middle
easy access to your
spaces bar, and of course,

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:33.666 align:middle
the ability to do split
view and adjust it

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.234 align:middle
to see exactly what
you are looking for,

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:38.371 align:middle
every pixel of your display
devoted to your content.

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:41.574 align:middle
Of course, there's much more
to experience in El Capitan,

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:45.378 align:middle
but now I want to
turn to performance.

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:49.615 align:middle
So we've optimized performance
throughout the system.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:53.519 align:middle
In fact, we are seeing about
a 1.4 times acceleration

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.522 align:middle
in app launching,
a 2x improvement

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:59.292 align:middle
in the snappiness
of switching apps.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:03.062 align:middle
The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:03.062 align:middle
The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:06.265 align:middle
Opening a PDF in preview,
four times as fast.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:10.102 align:middle
But we've also made deep
architectural improvements,

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:13.272 align:middle
and that brings us to Metal.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:16.175 align:middle
[Applause]

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle
Thank you.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.046 align:middle
Last year we introduced
Metal at WWDC as a way

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:23.683 align:middle
to accelerate graphics in
high-performance games.

00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:26.219 align:middle
It takes the overhead
out of OpenGL,

00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle
providing a high-performance API

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.423 align:middle
that gives the game
direct access to the power

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:32.425 align:middle
of the underlying
graphics hardware.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.028 align:middle
Well, this year we are
bringing Metal to the Mac.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.397 align:middle
And we are doing more than that.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:41.567 align:middle
Because we are taking the
graphic stacks on which apps

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle
on OS X are built, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.908 align:middle
and moving them from OpenGL to
run natively on top of Metal,

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle
making everything you do faster.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.145 align:middle
We are seeing 50
percent improvements

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:56.482 align:middle
in rendering performance
and a 40 percent reduction

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:59.118 align:middle
in the amount of CPU
necessary to do graphics.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:01.654 align:middle
That means improved performance
for your applications

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:01.654 align:middle
That means improved performance
for your applications

00:17:01.654 --> 00:17:03.489 align:middle
and better battery life.

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:06.791 align:middle
But the benefits of
Metal don't stop there.

00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:10.463 align:middle
Metal's also great for
high-performance apps.

00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle
In fact, Metal combines
the compute power of OpenCL

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.968 align:middle
and the graphics power of OpenGL

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:21.007 align:middle
in a higher performance
API that does both.

00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:22.340 align:middle
And what we've seen from working

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.078 align:middle
with early pro developers
is really phenomenal.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.314 align:middle
Adobe came in and,
in short order,

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:31.684 align:middle
was able to deliver an
eight times improvement

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle
in their rendering effects
inside of After Effects,

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle
and they have been able
to take the drawing engine

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.594 align:middle
in Illustrator, move it on top
of Metal, and take kinds of UI

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:44.797 align:middle
that previously was
noninteractive,

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle
like zoom of extremely
detailed drawings,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.669 align:middle
and make it completely flawless

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.271 align:middle
and interactive,
thanks to Metal.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.707 align:middle
Adobe is so pleased with this
they said they are committed

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:57.243 align:middle
to adopting Metal
on their OS X apps,

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.612 align:middle
seeing performance
increases up to 8x.

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle
They are excited
about what it can do

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle
They are excited
about what it can do

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.749 align:middle
for their Creative Cloud users.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.953 align:middle
Of course, Metal is
also fantastic for games

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:08.821 align:middle
with a 10x improvement.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:13.693 align:middle
That's ten times improvement
in drawing performance.

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:17.563 align:middle
So we brought in Epic to
see what they could do

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:20.433 align:middle
in short order, and the
results are really phenomenal.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.269 align:middle
I'd like to welcome to
the stage Josh Adams

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.305 align:middle
and Billy Bramer
for a quick demo.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.674 align:middle
[Applause]

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you,
Craig.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.913 align:middle
Thank you very much for
having us here today.

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:37.683 align:middle
So last year Metal
revolutionized graphics on iOS,

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:42.288 align:middle
and now Apple's amazed us again
by bringing Metal to the Mac.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:45.024 align:middle
Of course, this is
great news for games,

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:48.694 align:middle
but also for the tools that
we use to make those games.

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:51.864 align:middle
Here you are seeing Epic's
upcoming multiplayer title

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:54.066 align:middle
Fortnite, running
entirely on Metal.

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:57.236 align:middle
We are modifying it directly
within the Unreal Engine,

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle
a development tool that powers
many of today's best games.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle
a development tool that powers
many of today's best games.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:02.541 align:middle
It's quite a bit going
on in this scene, though,

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle
so let's break it down.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.013 align:middle
First, there are
64 different layers

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:10.616 align:middle
of rendering effects,
and that's a lot.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:12.051 align:middle
All combining together, though,

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:14.487 align:middle
to produce what you
see on the scene today.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:18.557 align:start
If we go into a simple wireframe
mode, you can see the thousands

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:20.793 align:middle
of building blocks that
make up this world.

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:25.031 align:middle
We can start to add in layers,
flat shading, detailed lighting,

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:28.434 align:middle
runtime shadows, and finally
we combine them all together

00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:31.103 align:middle
to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle
The interesting thing
here, though,

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.741 align:middle
is that all of the effects
you are seeing are being done

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle
completely in real-time.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.812 align:middle
Notice how the shadows and
objects interact nicely

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:42.014 align:middle
as Josh moves the car around.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:45.384 align:middle
Finally, we can change the
time of day on the fly,

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:48.687 align:middle
dramatically altering the
mood of the entire scene.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle
All of this is thanks to
the efficiency of Metal.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle
In fact, we are seeing
a 70 percent reduction

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.297 align:middle
in CPUs compared to OpenGL,
enabling developers like us

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle
to create richer 3D worlds.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle
to create richer 3D worlds.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:05.337 align:middle
Speaking of those worlds, let's
hop into the game, Fortnite.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.139 align:middle
Now, if you've ever
built a pillow fort

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.442 align:middle
and battled imaginary
monsters with your friends,

00:20:09.442 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle
you already know how
to play Fortnite.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.245 align:middle
This is the end-of-the-world
scenario you have been training

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:15.281 align:middle
for since you were a kid.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle
It's a beautifully
stylized universe.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.052 align:middle
You can destroy anything
you want.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.954 align:middle
Gather resources
and build a fort.

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:25.124 align:middle
So let's go ahead
and wreck this car.

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle
Gather its metal.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.763 align:middle
And continue our wanton
destruction by chopping

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:32.565 align:middle
down this tree to get
some wood for later.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:37.169 align:middle
Did we mention there
are purple death storms,

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.904 align:middle
like this one, for instance?

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.272 align:middle
We should go.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.775 align:middle
Luckily, while we were out
exploring, we found a multitude

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle
of weapons, and this broom.

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:49.081 align:middle
If we can just get
across the field,

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle
our friend has been busy
building a fort across the --

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:55.387 align:middle
did we mention the storms
are made of monsters?

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:59.725 align:middle
We are going to need something
a bit better than this broom.

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:03.996 align:middle
Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:03.996 align:middle
Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire.

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:07.733 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey,
look out!

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:11.303 align:middle
&gt;&gt; We call that move
the power cord.

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:14.507 align:middle
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:17.643 align:middle
You are going to
need a bigger fort.

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.246 align:middle
Place a trap, head inside.

00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle
Looks like an enemy has
broken into our fort.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.153 align:middle
All right.

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle
Let's use that wood we gathered
earlier to fix this wall,

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:34.593 align:middle
build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Glad you could
make it.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.803 align:middle
[Monster screaming]

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:47.139 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Whether you are a
gamer or a game developer,

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:50.743 align:middle
Metal opens new possibilities
for rich and engaging worlds.

00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:53.279 align:middle
You can download the Unreal
Engine for Mac right now,

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:56.515 align:middle
and the Fortnite beta
for Mac starts this fall.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.583 align:middle
Thank you very much.

00:21:57.583 --> 00:22:03.122 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

[Cheers and applause]

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, guys.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:07.993 align:middle
That was great.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.962 align:middle
We have been totally impressed
with what Epic has been able

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:12.031 align:middle
to accomplish in
such a short time.

00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:15.601 align:middle
And this is in part because the
work they did to adopt Metal

00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.271 align:middle
in their rendering engines for
iOS immediately pays dividends

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:22.641 align:middle
on OS X, and we are seeing
this with many other developers

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:25.811 align:middle
as well who are bringing their
gaming engines immediately

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.213 align:middle
to the Mac.

00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:30.216 align:middle
And pro app makers are seeing
the benefits of Metal as well,

00:22:30.216 --> 00:22:32.651 align:middle
people like The Foundry
and Autodesk.

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle
I think we are going to
see pro users, gamers,

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.989 align:middle
and all of us benefiting

00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:39.658 align:middle
from the performance
advantages of Metal.

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle
So that is El Capitan,
improvements

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:46.265 align:middle
to experience and performance.

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle
Now, El Capitan is available
to all of you developers today.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:57.176 align:middle
[Applause]

00:22:57.176 --> 00:23:01.113 align:middle
We will be doing a public
beta once again in July,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.176 --> 00:23:01.113 align:middle
We will be doing a public
beta once again in July,

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:03.349 align:middle
and we will be rolling
out to everyone

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:06.085 align:middle
with a free upgrade this fall.

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:09.688 align:middle
And that's our update on OS X.

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:16.629 align:middle
[Applause]

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle
Next -- you guessed it -- iOS.

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:22.735 align:middle
Now, our current big
release of iOS is iOS 8,

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:26.605 align:middle
and iOS 8 was a huge release
with tons of new features

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:29.608 align:middle
for users and a phenomenal
set of technologies

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle
that you developers
have been able to use

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.214 align:middle
to deliver all-new
experiences to the platform.

00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:38.651 align:middle
The upgrade rate for
iOS has been fantastic.

00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:42.388 align:middle
We have 83 percent of active
iPhone users currently running

00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:43.822 align:middle
the latest OS.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle
And this is really important

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.826 align:middle
because it means not only are
they getting the most recent

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:51.964 align:start
features, but they're also up to
date on all the security fixes,

00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:54.433 align:middle
and you're able to
know as a developer

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.568 align:middle
that you can target
all the users

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:59.438 align:middle
with the latest and
greatest APIs.

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:00.572 align:middle
And this is a benefit

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:00.572 align:middle
And this is a benefit

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:04.743 align:middle
that actually remains
really unique to iOS.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:10.482 align:middle
[Applause]

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:14.253 align:middle
So we are now looking forward
to iOS 9, and as we conceived

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:17.556 align:middle
of what we wanted to
accomplish, first and foremost,

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:21.327 align:middle
we wanted to elevate the
foundations of the platform,

00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:23.595 align:middle
things like extending
your battery life,

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:27.232 align:middle
improving performance,
and enhancing security

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:28.567 align:middle
to protect customer data.

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:32.471 align:middle
But there was more
we wanted to do.

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.741 align:middle
Adding intelligence throughout
the user experience in a way

00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:38.344 align:middle
that enhances how
you use your device

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:41.347 align:middle
but without compromising
your privacy.

00:24:41.347 --> 00:24:45.117 align:middle
Things like improving the
apps that you use most

00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:49.755 align:middle
and taking the experience of
the iPad to the next level.

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:53.992 align:middle
I want to start today with
intelligence and Siri.

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle
Now, Siri has quietly
become incredibly popular.

00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:01.033 align:middle
It serves over a billion
requests per week.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:01.033 align:middle
It serves over a billion
requests per week.

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.736 align:middle
And this is in part because
Siri has gotten so great

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle
at understanding
what we are saying.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.741 align:middle
In just the last year, we've
seen a 40 percent reduction

00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:12.478 align:middle
in word error rate,
down to 5 percent.

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle
That's an industry
leading number.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.249 align:middle
And Siri is 40 percent
faster than ever

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle
at responding to what we say.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:24.723 align:middle
Now, for iOS 9, Siri has a
beautiful new UI and is capable

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.759 align:middle
of doing so much more.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.427 align:middle
Things like "show me photos

00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:32.998 align:middle
from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle
photos from your photo library.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.837 align:middle
And Siri's really great
at taking reminders.

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:41.206 align:middle
Now you can ask Siri
things like "remind me

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:44.676 align:middle
to grab my coffee off the
roof of my car when I get in."

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle
Because Siri knows now when
you've gotten in the car.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.115 align:middle
And of course, we often want
to take reminders about things

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle
that we are looking at on our
device, some content inside

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.586 align:middle
of our app, maybe a Safari.

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:57.856 align:middle
Now you can say things
like "remind me about this

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle
when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle
when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.695 align:middle
with a link to specifically
what you were looking

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:06.331 align:middle
at when you took that reminder.

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.801 align:middle
So Siri is a great assistant.

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:12.304 align:middle
But the best assistants
are proactive.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:15.874 align:middle
And so on iOS 9, we are
bringing proactivity throughout

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.443 align:middle
the system.

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:20.345 align:middle
So say you like to run in
the morning, and when you do,

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.214 align:middle
you like to listen to music.

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:24.516 align:middle
Well, now your phone can
learn that about you,

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:26.485 align:middle
and when you plug
in your headphones,

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle
can offer up Now Playing
automatically right

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:30.889 align:middle
on the Lock screen.

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:35.828 align:middle
[Applause]

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:38.764 align:middle
And this is all
context-sensitive to the time,

00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:41.033 align:middle
the place, and even the
devices you are connected to,

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:44.069 align:start
so you do the same thing in the
car later on, and it might offer

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:48.373 align:middle
up the audio book that you
have been listening to.

00:26:48.373 --> 00:26:50.275 align:middle
Now, as a great assistant,

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:53.312 align:middle
your iPhone can now take
invitations you receive

00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:55.681 align:middle
in your email and without you
even touching them automatically

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:58.851 align:middle
put them on your calendar
and even give you a time

00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle
to leave reminder, taking

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle
to leave reminder, taking

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:04.189 align:middle
into account current traffic
conditions, and of course,

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle
with just a swipe, give you
access to driving directions.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.898 align:middle
Now, have you ever had this
happen to you, you get a call,

00:27:12.898 --> 00:27:14.199 align:middle
the number looks
kind of familiar,

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.034 align:middle
but you are really
not sure who it is?

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:19.104 align:middle
As a great assistant, your
phone can now look in your email

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:22.674 align:middle
and find out who that person
might be and suggest it

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.743 align:middle
to you right on the
Incoming Call screen.

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:25.944 align:middle
It's super handy.

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:31.483 align:middle
[Applause]

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle
Now, this kind of
proactivity is also great

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle
when it comes to Search.

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.857 align:middle
So now when you swipe to the
left of the Home screen to get

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:42.928 align:middle
to Search, you see that Siri
offers great suggestions,

00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:45.864 align:start
things like the people that you
might want to contact now based

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle
on your upcoming meetings and
your communication patterns,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle
the apps that you might want
to launch based, for instance,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.139 align:middle
on what you just downloaded
from the App Store and haven't

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle
yet tried out, or apps you
tend to use this time of day,

00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:01.513 align:middle
and also easy one-tap
links to locations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:01.513 align:middle
and also easy one-tap
links to locations

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.416 align:middle
that are relevant nearby,
and even breaking news.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:09.488 align:middle
When it comes to Search, we
also know more than ever before.

00:28:09.488 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle
So for instance, you can
search for sports scores.

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:15.928 align:middle
And we now support video
search, of popular video sites

00:28:15.928 --> 00:28:19.831 align:middle
like Vivi, Vimeo, YouTube,
and the iTunes Store.

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.534 align:middle
And we have these
great descriptive cards

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.103 align:middle
with a Play button so
you can play directly

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.905 align:middle
from your search result.

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle
Most importantly, we now
have an API for Search.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:39.084 align:middle
[Applause]

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:41.219 align:middle
So now when a user
performs a search,

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle
we can find content behind
the apps they have installed

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:49.061 align:middle
on the device and pull those up
in Results, and when they tap,

00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:53.065 align:middle
they are deep-linked
directly into the application.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.968 align:middle
You see for instance
here Airbnb.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.403 align:middle
They can get their result.

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.472 align:middle
Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.472 align:middle
Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:03.508 align:middle
so they can get right back
to their search results.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:06.612 align:middle
So we think these kinds

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:10.215 align:middle
of intelligence features
really make a huge difference

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:11.249 align:middle
in your experience in iOS.

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle
And to show you how, I would

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:14.853 align:middle
like to give you
a quick demo now.

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:22.461 align:middle
So I want to take you through
a day in the life with iOS 9,

00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle
and we are going to start with
a typical day for me today.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.403 align:middle
We are going to start
in my bedroom

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:33.205 align:middle
when I woke up in the morning.

00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:36.475 align:middle
You will notice because my phone
knows that in the morning I

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:40.746 align:middle
like to meditate that it's
offered me a meditation app

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:43.148 align:middle
right here in the bottom
left of the screen.

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:44.883 align:middle
So I can just swipe up
from the bottom left,

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:49.021 align:middle
and I am taken right
in to meditate.

00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:51.456 align:middle
Ah, this is so serene.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:55.761 align:middle
Well, it looks like I got
a message here from Phil.

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:59.097 align:middle
So Phil says that he is
putting together the invite

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:02.467 align:middle
for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:02.467 align:middle
for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.404 align:middle
up this super awesome
karaoke machine?

00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:07.906 align:middle
Well, you know, Siri actually,
when I take reminders,

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:10.275 align:middle
is able to link me right back
to what I am looking for,

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.411 align:middle
so if I want to remember to pick
this up, I can just say this

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:16.415 align:middle
to Siri: "Remind me
about this later today."

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle
And so Siri will put
together a reminder,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.958 align:middle
and you see the link right
back to what I am looking for.

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle
Well, I think after all,
meditation isn't probably

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.798 align:middle
for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise.

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:37.836 align:middle
So I head into the home gym
here, and because my phone knows

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:40.605 align:middle
that when I am in the home gym
and I hook up headphones and I

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:43.108 align:middle
like to listen to music,
watch what happens when I plug

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.912 align:middle
in the cord of my headphones.

00:30:46.912 --> 00:30:49.981 align:middle
Jumps right in and offers
me some energetic music.

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:51.216 align:middle
So let's all bust a move.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.852 align:middle
I don't know what kind

00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:57.122 align:middle
of exercise we are all
doing here, but pretty good.

00:30:57.122 --> 00:30:59.224 align:middle
Looks like actually
I've got that invitation

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.259 align:middle
that Phil was going to send me.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.259 align:middle
that Phil was going to send me.

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.995 align:middle
Now, normally I would have
to actually go into Mail,

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:06.832 align:middle
look at the time, put this
on my Calendar, but in fact,

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:08.734 align:middle
my phone has automatically
done that for me.

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle
Let me just swipe down here
into Notifications Center,

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.272 align:middle
and we will look at my
calendar for the day.

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:18.477 align:start
You notice it automatically has
already been added right there.

00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:20.045 align:middle
Now, if we look at
the rest of my day,

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:22.047 align:middle
ahead I have my vocal warm-ups

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:25.584 align:middle
for the karaoke performance,
then WWDC.

00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:29.254 align:middle
It looks like I have
a little bit of time

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.323 align:middle
to prepare my dish
for the big potluck.

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle
So I am going to head
into the kitchen now,

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:35.894 align:middle
and let's just swipe in.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.596 align:middle
When I am looking for
recipes, for instance,

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle
I like to go into Search.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.732 align:middle
Let's just swipe
over into Search.

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:44.436 align:start
We see Siri has actually already
-- before I typed a character --

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:47.239 align:middle
made suggestions for me
for people I could contact,

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:50.142 align:middle
for instance, like Trent
Reznor, my vocal coach.

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:52.344 align:middle
[Laughter] So I can just tap.

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:54.412 align:middle
Here I can call Trent up,
and he can help me tap

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle
into my inner pain and
rage that allows me

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle
to fuel my vocal performances.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.552 align:middle
I actually haven't been
able to find the pain

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.552 align:middle
I actually haven't been
able to find the pain

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:02.687 align:middle
and rage, truth be told.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle
Also, we have all these
great apps I can run

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.927 align:middle
and locations nearby -- for
instance, because it's morning,

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.429 align:middle
you see coffee and tea and
breakfast places are suggested.

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.098 align:middle
As well as news.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.133 align:middle
But in this case, I
actually want to do a search.

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:17.169 align:middle
So I have some potatoes
I think I could make use

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.336 align:middle
of in this recipe.

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle
So let's just search for potato.

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:23.175 align:middle
Here you notice I am
getting search results right

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:24.576 align:middle
from Yummly.

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:28.013 align:middle
Let me tap into Yummly, and you
see I am deep-linked directly

00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:31.383 align:middle
in, so I get the great view
provided by that application.

00:32:31.383 --> 00:32:33.585 align:middle
Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for,

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:35.187 align:middle
so I am going to hit
the Back link here,

00:32:35.187 --> 00:32:36.688 align:middle
and I can browse directly

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:40.258 align:middle
in to another result,
Canadian Poutine.

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:43.195 align:middle
That looks exactly like
what the doctor ordered.

00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:45.997 align:middle
Yes. Let's look at
the ingredients.

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:49.067 align:middle
Looks like 6 tablespoons
of unsalted butter.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.202 align:middle
I am down with that.

00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle
I am going to make at
least a double batch.

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle
So I can just use Search to do
a conversion of tablespoons,

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.945 align:middle
figure out how much that is.

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.514 align:middle
So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.514 align:middle
So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup.

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:04.783 align:middle
I am going to round
up to an even quart

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle
and make myself some
fine poutine.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.623 align:middle
[Laughter] So Search
is really handy,

00:33:11.623 --> 00:33:14.292 align:middle
but Siri is also
great at search.

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:16.494 align:middle
So I want to jump
forward to later today.

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:20.799 align:middle
When I think I will be
reminiscing about WWDC's past.

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:24.269 align:middle
I can ask Siri to
help me with that.

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:30.141 align:middle
Show my photos from last
June in San Francisco.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:34.246 align:middle
Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC.

00:33:34.246 --> 00:33:37.315 align:middle
You notice now Photos in iOS
9 has this great scrubber bar

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:39.351 align:middle
at the bottom, so
I can easily slide

00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:42.354 align:middle
through photos super
quickly, just like this.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:45.857 align:middle
Oh, boy, now we are
into the karaoke night.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.359 align:middle
This is some fine stuff.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.795 align:middle
Phil really does an
awesome Viking crooner.

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:51.796 align:middle
This is good stuff.

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:55.166 align:middle
But of course, the
king of karaoke --

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.534 align:middle
[Laughter] -- Eddy Cue.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.703 align:middle
In fact, when I want to get
really pumped up and inspired

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle
for karaoke night,
I like to turn

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle
for karaoke night,
I like to turn

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:05.277 align:middle
to my Eddy karaoke album,
so let's do that now.

00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:07.545 align:middle
Show my karaoke photos of Eddy.

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle
Oh, that is the master at work.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:22.226 align:middle
Hitting -- I love this hat.

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:25.263 align:middle
[Laughter] This is totally dope.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.464 align:middle
Great stuff.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle
Well, I could really look
at these just all day,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.501 align:middle
but you know, actually,

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:32.003 align:middle
my assistant has given
me a reminder based

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:34.105 align:middle
on traffic conditions that it's
time to leave, so I am going

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.375 align:middle
to wrap up this demo of
intelligence on iOS 9.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:45.784 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:47.052 align:middle
So you've seen how
we've been able

00:34:47.052 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle
to bring intelligence throughout
the experience in iOS 9,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:58.063 align:middle
but we do it in a way that does
not compromise your privacy.

00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:01.999 align:middle
We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:01.999 align:middle
We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:04.135 align:middle
in the cloud to learn
things about you.

00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:07.872 align:middle
We honestly just
don't want to know.

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:11.676 align:middle
All of this is done on
device, and it stays

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:14.412 align:middle
on device, under your control.

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:22.053 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:24.556 align:middle
And if we do have to perform
a lookup on your behalf,

00:35:24.556 --> 00:35:27.459 align:middle
for example, for current traffic
conditions, it's anonymous,

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:30.261 align:middle
it's not associated with your
Apple ID, it's not linked

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.696 align:middle
with other Apple services,

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:34.265 align:middle
and it's not shared
with third parties.

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:35.133 align:middle
Why would do you that?

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.469 align:middle
It is in your control.

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.438 align:middle
That is intelligence in iOS 9.

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:46.478 align:middle
[Applause]

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle
Next, let's turn to Apple Pay.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.649 align:middle
And to take you through
it, I'd like to bring

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.885 align:middle
to the stage our Vice President

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:56.254 align:middle
of our Apple Pay
business, Jennifer Bailey.

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:57.455 align:middle
Jennifer.

00:35:57.455 --> 00:36:01.493 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.455 --> 00:36:01.493 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER BAILEY:
Thanks, Craig.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.163 align:middle
It's great to be here.

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:09.401 align:middle
We have been hard at work on our
goal of replacing the wallet,

00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:12.604 align:middle
and we've got some exciting
updates for you today.

00:36:12.604 --> 00:36:16.508 align:middle
I hope you've all tried Apple
Pay with our super easy, secure,

00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle
and private way to pay.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.013 align:start
Last year we started with credit
and debit cards, and we now have

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:25.383 align:middle
over 2,500 banks
supporting Apple Pay.

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:28.953 align:middle
And this fall, Discover will
bring Apple Pay to the more

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle
than 50 million card members.

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:36.928 align:middle
[Applause]

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:40.532 align:middle
Popular merchants are also
expanding their acceptance

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:43.301 align:middle
for Apple Pay, including
great retailers

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle
who will be supporting
Apple Pay this year,

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:50.008 align:middle
including Trader Joe's,
Baskin-Robbins, and JCPenny.

00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:53.278 align:middle
These incredible brands join
a great list of the biggest

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle
and best merchants
supporting Apple Pay

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.748 align:middle
since our launch in October.

00:36:56.748 --> 00:37:00.318 align:middle
And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:56.748 --> 00:37:00.318 align:middle
And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:02.987 align:middle
to have finals tickets,
you will be able to pay

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:07.525 align:middle
for all your team logo wear at
both arenas using Apple Pay.

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:12.564 align:middle
[Applause]

00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle
Small businesses are
also important for us,

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:17.535 align:middle
so we are working with
innovative companies like Square

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:21.139 align:middle
to enable millions of small
businesses to accept Apple Pay.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:26.311 align:middle
This fall, Square will
launch a gorgeous new reader.

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:29.514 align:middle
Preorders are starting
today on square.com,

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:30.682 align:middle
and these will be available

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:34.052 align:middle
in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall.

00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:38.123 align:middle
With fantastic support of
merchants, both large and small,

00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:42.093 align:middle
we will surpass 1 million
locations accepting Apple Pay

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.561 align:middle
next month.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle
[Applause]

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle
And thanks to our
amazing developers,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.772 align:middle
we have great momentum
within apps as well.

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.876 align:middle
Apple Pay is so easy
to use in-app,

00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:01.012 align:middle
our developers are telling
us they are seeing more

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:01.012 align:middle
our developers are telling
us they are seeing more

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:04.749 align:middle
than two times increase
in checkout rates.

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:07.018 align:middle
And we are adding new
apps with Apple Pay

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle
to the App Store every day.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.422 align:middle
Here are some of the latest,
representing a great range

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:15.093 align:middle
of categories, from
Delta in travel to Etsy,

00:38:15.093 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle
the leading crafts marketplace.

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:22.033 align:middle
These apps join an incredible
group that are redefining new

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.737 align:middle
and simpler ways to pay.

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle
We're also excited to be
working with Pinterest.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.709 align:middle
Later this month, Pinterest
will launch Buyable Pins,

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:35.547 align:middle
where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores,

00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:38.383 align:middle
including Neiman
Marcus and Macy's,

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:42.053 align:middle
right from within the
Pinterest app using Apple Pay,

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.622 align:middle
and only on iOS.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:52.397 align:middle
[Applause]

00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle
With the great momentum
of Apple Pay in the U.S.,

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.434 align:middle
we are now excited to announce

00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:59.637 align:middle
that we are bringing
Apple Pay to the UK.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:04.976 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:04.976 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:08.146 align:middle
And it's coming next month!

00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:09.681 align:middle
[Applause]

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:12.984 align:middle
We will launch with eight
of the most popular banks,

00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:15.787 align:middle
with more coming this fall.

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:18.223 align:middle
With this great lineup of
banks, we will support more

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:23.127 align:middle
than 70 percent of the credit
and debit cards in the UK.

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.897 align:middle
Great merchants are also
lining up to support Apple Pay,

00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:30.068 align:middle
like Boots, Costa Coffee,
and iconic British brands,

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:32.103 align:middle
like Marks and Spencer
and Waitrose.

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:36.174 align:middle
We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:37.275 align:middle
in the UK.

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle
That's more than we
started with in the U.S.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.446 align:middle
at our initial launch.

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:43.881 align:middle
We are also thrilled that
our customers will be able

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle
to commute and pay
for their fares

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.687 align:middle
on the London transportation
system with Apple Pay.

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:56.828 align:middle
[Applause]

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.296 align:middle
So that's Apple Pay
coming to the UK.

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:01.099 align:middle
Now let's talk about
some of the new features

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:01.099 align:middle
Now let's talk about
some of the new features

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:03.701 align:middle
that we are adding in iOS 9.

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle
First, you will be
able to add your store,

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.406 align:middle
credit, and debit cards.

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:11.709 align:middle
Store cards offer unique
membership benefits,

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:15.113 align:middle
and leading retailers
like Kohl's, JCPenney,

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:19.617 align:middle
and BJs will be the first to
offer their cards on Apple Pay.

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:22.654 align:middle
We will also add loyalty
and rewards cards,

00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:24.822 align:middle
also with a great
lineup of merchants.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:27.892 align:middle
Kohl's will bring
Yes2You programs,

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.362 align:middle
Walgreens their Balance Rewards
card, and for your coffee

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:35.066 align:middle
and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay

00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:38.736 align:middle
to their DDPerks
beginning this fall.

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:44.242 align:middle
[Applause]

00:40:44.242 --> 00:40:47.912 align:middle
and Apple Pay automatically
presents the right card,

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.114 align:middle
so you will never miss a reward.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:53.885 align:middle
With the expansion of Apple
Pay and the new types of cards,

00:40:53.885 --> 00:40:58.756 align:middle
we decided it's time to
rename Passbook to Wallet.

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:04.929 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:04.929 align:middle
[Applause]

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.199 align:middle
One place for all your credit
and debit cards, loyalty cards,

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.702 align:middle
boarding passes, and more.

00:41:10.702 --> 00:41:13.571 align:middle
We told you last year
that our ultimate goal was

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.239 align:middle
to replace the wallet,
and we are well

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:18.209 align:middle
on the way to doing just that.

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:22.146 align:middle
We couldn't be happier with
the progress towards our vision

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.048 align:middle
and with the momentum
of Apple Pay.

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.783 align:middle
Thank you.

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:34.859 align:middle
[Applause]

00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:36.861 align:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's Apple Pay.

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.030 align:middle
Let's turn now to
our enhancements

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.935 align:middle
to the apps you use most, and we
are going to start with Notes.

00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:48.206 align:middle
Notes is used regularly by about
half of our users on iPhone,

00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:51.943 align:middle
and for iOS 9, we have some
really great enhancements.

00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:54.178 align:middle
It starts with how you
work with simple text.

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.849 align:middle
So now Notes provides
a really handy toolbar

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:00.318 align:middle
with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:00.318 align:middle
with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance,

00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:04.222 align:middle
to create titles, heading
styles, numbered lists.

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:07.725 align:middle
But of course, we all like to
create checklists in our notes,

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:09.827 align:middle
and so Notes makes
that really easy.

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:12.463 align:middle
And of course, you can
just check off your items

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.198 align:middle
with just a tap.

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.934 align:middle
Now, because a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:20.171 align:middle
we make it easy to get at your
camera and your camera roll

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:23.241 align:middle
and put photos directly
in your notes.

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:27.578 align:middle
We are also providing a great
new way to capture your ideas

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:30.381 align:middle
by just drawing with
your finger.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle
We provide some great
drawing tools.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.218 align:middle
You can make sketches
with these tools

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.854 align:middle
and drop them right
inside your note.

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:41.058 align:middle
[Applause]

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.794 align:middle
Now, I don't know
if you are like me,

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:44.328 align:middle
but a lot of times the
things I want to put

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:46.164 align:middle
on my notes are things I
am looking at that I find

00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:49.600 align:middle
in other apps -- for
instance, a web page in Safari.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle
So now from the Share
sheet, you can just

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:56.507 align:middle
with a tap add a link
right back into your notes.

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:59.310 align:middle
And we make it really
easy to find your notes.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.179 align:middle
So we organize them
by time, of course,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.179 align:middle
So we organize them
by time, of course,

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle
and now we have these
great thumbnails

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.749 align:middle
to let you see your
embedded images at a glance,

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:08.653 align:middle
but we also provide this
cool new Attachments view

00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:12.657 align:middle
that shows you all of your
photos, your maps links,

00:43:12.657 --> 00:43:15.660 align:middle
your website links, and when
you tap, you can get right back

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.361 align:middle
to the note where
they came from.

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:21.466 align:middle
Now, Notes is great
on iPhone, on iPad,

00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:23.034 align:middle
and of course, on
the Mac as well.

00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:26.737 align:middle
And all of your content is
kept up to date across all

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:29.373 align:middle
of your devices via iCloud.

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:31.909 align:middle
That's a quick update to Notes.

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:37.582 align:middle
[Applause]

00:43:37.582 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle
Next, let's turn to Maps.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.587 align:middle
We've continued to
invest heavily in Maps,

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:44.755 align:middle
and the improvements
are really awesome.

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle
We are seeing five billion
user requests per week.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.964 align:middle
Usage on iOS is 3.5 times higher

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:56.133 align:middle
than for the next
leading mapping app.

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.802 align:middle
Now, Maps, of course,

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:01.539 align:middle
historically have been
focused on drivers.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:01.539 align:middle
historically have been
focused on drivers.

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:04.876 align:middle
They emphasize things
like freeways and roads.

00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:09.547 align:middle
But we know for a lot of our iOS
users, they are mostly focused

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:13.851 align:middle
on public transit, and so now
we've created a great map just

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.287 align:middle
for them.

00:44:16.287 --> 00:44:18.956 align:middle
[Applause] Yes, it's Transit.

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:22.293 align:middle
[Applause]

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:24.729 align:middle
With Transit, we provide
a map that emphasizes all

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:28.032 align:middle
of the different transit
lines, buses, and trains,

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.469 align:middle
subway stations and so forth,
and when you tap on a station,

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:33.704 align:middle
you can see all the
lines that run through it

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.273 align:middle
with their departure times.

00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:40.177 align:middle
And we do multimodal routing,
whether you are taking a train,

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.047 align:middle
a subway, a bus, or a ferry.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:46.751 align:middle
And we provide step-by-step
directions, including time

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:48.052 align:middle
for walking directions.

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:52.290 align:middle
But we've taken special care
to get the details right,

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.926 align:middle
the ones that matter,
with Transit.

00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:58.396 align:middle
For instance, if you take a
subway station like this one

00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:03.501 align:start
in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:03.501 align:start
in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map.

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:04.835 align:middle
If you look closer,

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:08.039 align:middle
it's actually an enormous
underground structure spanning

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:13.244 align:middle
many city blocks, and so
we carefully surveyed all

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:15.746 align:middle
of the entrances and exits

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:18.649 align:middle
so that we could give you
walking directions based

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:21.786 align:middle
on the time to travel from
where you actually are.

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:24.188 align:middle
Now, this not only saves
you a ton of walking,

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.823 align:middle
but it also probably
is the difference

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:28.926 align:middle
between catching your train
on time and being stuck.

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:31.028 align:middle
[Applause] It's really great.

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:37.335 align:middle
[Applause]

00:45:37.335 --> 00:45:40.605 align:middle
We've taught Siri all about
Transit, so it's effortless

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:43.541 align:middle
to ask Siri for directions.

00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.811 align:middle
And we are going to be
rolling Maps out, Transit,

00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:51.816 align:middle
starting with these cities
across the world, and --

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:55.052 align:middle
[Applause] -- with these
and 300 more in China.

00:45:55.052 --> 00:46:02.259 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:55.052 --> 00:46:02.259 align:middle
[Applause]

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle
Now, when it comes
to searching in Maps,

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle
we are now letting
you find locations

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.432 align:middle
by type nearby with just a tap.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:11.769 align:middle
And when you find the
location you are interested in,

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.771 align:middle
the card will tell you
right away right there

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle
in the bottom whether
they support Apple Pay.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.075 align:middle
Support those Apple
Pay merchants.

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:21.912 align:middle
[Applause]

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:25.349 align:middle
Maps is great on
iPhone and iPad,

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:28.853 align:middle
and of course, the Mac as well.

00:46:28.853 --> 00:46:31.088 align:middle
And that is Maps.

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:37.962 align:middle
[Applause]

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:42.566 align:middle
The apps that we've chosen
to build in to iOS are there

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:46.103 align:middle
because they represent
fundamental experiences

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:48.339 align:middle
to living on a mobile device.

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.842 align:middle
And there's been one that we've
been wanting to do for years,

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:55.346 align:middle
something that so many of
us find ourselves wanting

00:46:55.346 --> 00:47:00.518 align:middle
to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:55.346 --> 00:47:00.518 align:middle
to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased

00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:04.321 align:middle
to announce that we are
introducing a new application,

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:07.058 align:middle
and it's called News.

00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:10.428 align:middle
News is beautiful content

00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:15.199 align:middle
from the world's greatest
sources personalized for you.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:18.069 align:middle
Now, here's an article in News.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:20.104 align:middle
It's absolutely stunning.

00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:23.941 align:middle
Now, publishers can easily
create beautiful content using

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:30.381 align:middle
gorgeous imagery, custom
layout, and rich typography.

00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:33.884 align:middle
But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:36.654 align:middle
at News in action,
I'd like to invite

00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:39.724 align:middle
to the stage our Vice
President of Application,

00:47:39.724 --> 00:47:42.393 align:middle
Product Management,
Susan Prescott.

00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:43.160 align:middle
Susan.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.698 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:52.303 align:middle
&gt;&gt; SUSAN PRESCOTT:
Thanks, Craig.

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:53.404 align:middle
Thank you.

00:47:53.404 --> 00:47:54.772 align:middle
I am really excited
to be the first person

00:47:54.772 --> 00:47:56.006 align:middle
to show you our new News app.

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.409 align:middle
It's right here on
the Home screen.

00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:01.545 align:middle
The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:01.545 align:middle
The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like,

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle
so it's going to
give me a short list

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.883 align:middle
of really great choices
to choose from.

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle
And you'll see as I tap,
additional recommendations come

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.623 align:middle
in on the bottom to give
you even more choices.

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle
So I read Atlantic, Wired,
New York Times, and ESPN.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.929 align:middle
I am still with you, Warriors!

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.332 align:middle
And Daring Fireball.

00:48:21.332 --> 00:48:25.436 align:middle
Topics, too, like science,
baking, and travel.

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:28.105 align:middle
I could keep going, but I
think that's a great start,

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.474 align:middle
so I will tap Done.

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:34.145 align:middle
News creates a personalized
feed called For You.

00:48:34.145 --> 00:48:36.781 align:middle
It's based on the
choices I just made,

00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:39.550 align:middle
and it's all my News
in one place.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.119 align:middle
You can see it looks great.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:48.359 align:middle
It's easy to scan, and it
updates every time I check News.

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:50.528 align:middle
The articles can
come from anywhere,

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:54.932 align:middle
but the best ones are built
in our new Apple News format,

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle
like this Wired article
featuring Rashida Jones,

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.771 align:middle
awesome in Parks &amp;
Rec and The Office.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.771 align:middle
awesome in Parks &amp;
Rec and The Office.

00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:05.009 align:middle
Look at the rich
typography, beautiful images,

00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:09.146 align:middle
and my favorite part are
the really fun animations.

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.581 align:middle
It's fast and fluid.

00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:15.085 align:middle
We think this offers the best
mobile reading experience ever.

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:19.023 align:middle
To get to the next
article, I just swipe.

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:20.991 align:middle
It's not just great
for magazines;

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.226 align:middle
it's great for newspapers too.

00:49:22.226 --> 00:49:24.495 align:middle
This is a New York Times
article, and it looks

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle
like a New York Times article.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:31.101 align:middle
Swipe down, there's a photo
gallery right in line, fast,

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:33.003 align:middle
fluid to swipe through.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:35.539 align:middle
Go to the next article,
this one's from Quartz,

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:39.376 align:middle
but I am seeing it because I
said I am interested in science.

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:41.579 align:middle
It's a pretty cool
article about a font based

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:43.614 align:middle
on Albert Einstein's
handwriting.

00:49:43.614 --> 00:49:46.083 align:middle
The animation makes it
come to life, and frankly,

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.785 align:middle
who knew he had such
neat handwriting?

00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:49.854 align:middle
It's kind of interesting.

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:53.824 align:middle
Swipe again, and I get an
article from Bon Appetit.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.227 align:middle
Great summer recipes,

00:49:56.227 --> 00:50:00.698 align:middle
and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:56.227 --> 00:50:00.698 align:middle
and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun.

00:50:00.698 --> 00:50:03.434 align:middle
[Laughter] So I am a little
busy right now, so I am going

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:06.036 align:middle
to go ahead and bookmark
this to read later.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:11.308 align:middle
Now, ESPN, I love you, Steph.

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:14.545 align:middle
[Applause]

00:50:14.545 --> 00:50:17.314 align:middle
Now, I read ESPN
for the articles,

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:20.751 align:middle
but there's also
some beautiful --

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:24.321 align:middle
[Laughter] -- photos and videos.

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:32.129 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.231 align:middle
Some photos and videos built in.

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.232 align:middle
Not so much last night.

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:38.202 align:middle
Let's see if Steph
can make this one.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle
Swish. All right.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.139 align:middle
He is going to be
there for us next game.

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:47.945 align:start
In addition, data and stats are
part of what's fun about sports,

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.247 align:middle
so of course, rich info
graphics can be part of it.

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.216 align:middle
I am going to swipe
back to For You.

00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:55.986 align:middle
Now, News is smart, so the
more I read, the better it gets

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:58.555 align:middle
at showing me stories
I am interested in.

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:01.725 align:middle
But what if I want to
discover something new?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:01.725 align:middle
But what if I want to
discover something new?

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:05.496 align:middle
I can tap here in the bottom
on Explore, and Explore,

00:51:05.496 --> 00:51:06.830 align:middle
based on what I've read,

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.234 align:middle
will show me new publisher
channels I might be interested

00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:12.603 align:middle
in and suggested topics.

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:14.505 align:middle
Well, I love technology.

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:16.573 align:middle
I am going to go
ahead and follow that.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:20.311 align:middle
But News keeps track of
more than a million topics.

00:51:20.311 --> 00:51:23.447 align:middle
So I can be much more
specific about my interests.

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:26.016 align:middle
To do that, I can tap
on Search and type.

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:28.218 align:middle
I am going to type Swift.

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:32.823 align:middle
And I get a number of hits,
everything from Taylor Swift,

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.991 align:middle
to what I was looking for,

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:36.160 align:middle
Apple's new programming
language.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.964 align:middle
So it's a beautiful feed,
and what's really cool

00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:43.100 align:middle
about this is there are powerful
machine learning algorithms

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.602 align:middle
that analyze the contents
of the articles to figure

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:48.839 align:middle
out which stories
belong in which article.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.741 align:middle
This looks like just
what I was hoping for.

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:54.511 align:middle
I am going to go ahead and
add Swift to my Favorites.

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.146 align:middle
So let's take a look
at Favorites.

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:58.248 align:middle
I will tap down here.

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:01.185 align:middle
Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:01.185 align:middle
Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following,

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:04.021 align:middle
including Swift,
which I just added.

00:52:04.021 --> 00:52:05.956 align:middle
It's a great place to
go if I want to dig

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.758 align:middle
into a particular
topic or if I want

00:52:07.758 --> 00:52:09.793 align:middle
to read a newspaper
or a magazine.

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:12.763 align:middle
Let's say today I
want to read Wired.

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:14.031 align:middle
You can tell I am in
the Wired channel.

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:15.532 align:middle
You see the Wired
logo at the top

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:19.503 align:middle
and the Wired channel
starting with Top Stories.

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:22.773 align:middle
I can swipe through and see a
collection of the all the print

00:52:22.773 --> 00:52:25.542 align:middle
and web stories built
in Apple News format,

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.543 align:middle
and it looks terrific.

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:30.681 align:middle
I am going to look
at one more story.

00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:35.486 align:middle
This is about the first
civilian artist in space.

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:37.788 align:middle
Cool concept and really cool.

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:40.290 align:middle
I want to show you this.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.993 align:middle
We've taken photo
galleries to the next level

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.362 align:middle
with something we
call Photo Mosaics.

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:48.699 align:middle
Look how beautiful
it looks on the page.

00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:52.102 align:middle
Stunning. And, as you'd expect,

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:56.407 align:middle
I just tap to zoom
in on the photos.

00:52:56.407 --> 00:52:58.609 align:middle
It looks great.

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:01.045 align:middle
We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:01.045 align:middle
We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:03.414 align:middle
experience, a mobile reading
experience in general,

00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:05.716 align:middle
and this is just
one of many channels

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:08.485 align:middle
with beautiful stories
built in Apple News format.

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:10.387 align:middle
That is a really
quick look at News.

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:11.722 align:middle
We can't wait to get
it in your hands.

00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:13.490 align:middle
Thank you very much.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:22.566 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:25.502 align:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's News.

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.771 align:middle
Stunning content.

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.606 align:middle
Personalized for you.

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:34.278 align:middle
Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well.

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:36.680 align:middle
And of course, unlike just

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.249 align:middle
about any other news
aggregation service we are aware

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:42.186 align:middle
of on the planet, News is
designed from the ground

00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:45.255 align:middle
up with your privacy in mind.

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:47.825 align:middle
We worked with leading
publishers,

00:53:47.825 --> 00:53:49.159 align:middle
like The New York Times,

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:53.297 align:middle
who will be delivering 33
articles daily to News users,

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:56.900 align:middle
and ESPN, who will be
bringing the depth and range

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.136 align:middle
of their phenomenal
sports reporting.

00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:02.639 align:middle
And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:02.639 align:middle
And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:07.044 align:middle
of their magazines, like
Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ,

00:54:07.044 --> 00:54:09.213 align:middle
Wired, and Bon Appetite.

00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:12.382 align:middle
And they will be joined
by many, many others read

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:14.985 align:middle
by millions of users daily.

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:18.589 align:middle
News isn't just for
the media titans.

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:21.658 align:middle
Great content comes from
all kinds of sources,

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:25.829 align:start
and we want them all in News, so
whether it's a local newspaper,

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:29.032 align:middle
a blog, or a special-interest
publication,

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.567 align:middle
they will all be here.

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:35.472 align:middle
We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States,

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:38.108 align:middle
the UK, and Australia.

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.577 align:middle
We think you are
really going to like it.

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:49.086 align:middle
[Applause]

00:54:49.086 --> 00:54:51.188 align:middle
Next, let's turn to iPad.

00:54:51.188 --> 00:54:56.326 align:middle
Now, iPad is a transformational
device.

00:54:56.326 --> 00:55:02.366 align:middle
For our users in education,
business, and at home,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:56.326 --> 00:55:02.366 align:middle
For our users in education,
business, and at home,

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:07.171 align:middle
for many of them, their iPad
is their primary computer.

00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:11.308 align:middle
And iPads are just tremendously
powerful, so in iOS 9,

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:15.512 align:middle
we are elevating the iPad
experience to a whole new level.

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.614 align:middle
Now, it starts with
something really simple,

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:20.384 align:middle
which is how you work with text.

00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:22.886 align:middle
That brings us to the
QuickType keyboard.

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:26.256 align:middle
Now, in iOS 8, we
introduced the Suggestion bar

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:28.358 align:middle
that makes it quicker
than ever to type

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:31.128 align:middle
and enter what you
are trying to get in.

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:36.133 align:middle
But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar,

00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:40.170 align:middle
so with just a tap, you can cut,
copy, paste, format your text,

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.605 align:middle
access your attachments.

00:55:41.605 --> 00:55:43.373 align:middle
It's really handy.

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:46.843 align:middle
But you know, what makes
a Multi-Touch keyboard

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:49.479 align:middle
so special is that it
can be anything you want.

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:51.014 align:middle
It can transform.

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:55.986 align:middle
So now when you want to move
the cursor or make a selection,

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:59.456 align:middle
you can now just put two
fingers down on the keyboard,

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.658 align:middle
and it becomes a
trackpad instantly.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.658 align:middle
and it becomes a
trackpad instantly.

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:07.364 align:middle
[Applause]

00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:10.767 align:middle
You can move the cursor,
you can make selections.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle
Of course, you can use
the shortcut bar to cut,

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:16.607 align:middle
drag to a new place, and
paste, editing more quickly

00:56:16.607 --> 00:56:19.209 align:middle
than ever before and without
your fingers ever leaving the

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:19.843 align:middle
home row.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.678 align:middle
It's really great.

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:26.450 align:middle
[Applause]

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.885 align:middle
And if you do occasionally want
to hook a physical keyboard

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:31.922 align:middle
to your iPad as well, we
made that better than ever.

00:56:31.922 --> 00:56:34.157 align:middle
We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:36.093 align:middle
that can accelerate
your operations

00:56:36.093 --> 00:56:38.262 align:middle
in the applications
using the keyboard,

00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:40.931 align:middle
and we've provided
shortcuts for app switching.

00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:42.499 align:middle
This might look familiar
to some of you.

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:46.703 align:middle
As well as to searching
in Spotlight.

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:50.507 align:middle
So that's QuickType, but now
I want to turn to the big one,

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:52.709 align:middle
and that's Multitasking.

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:58.649 align:middle
[Applause]

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.885 align:middle
So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.885 align:middle
So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking,

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:04.087 align:middle
like this great graphical
task switcher,

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.189 align:middle
and these nice four-finger
gestures

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:08.892 align:middle
that let you move
between applications.

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:12.696 align:middle
But for iOS 9, we are taking
it to a whole new place,

00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:15.732 align:middle
and I'd like to show
that to you now.

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:21.004 align:middle
[Applause]

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.306 align:middle
So let's start here on my iPad.

00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:24.975 align:middle
And what I am going to
do first is double-tap

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:29.746 align:middle
on the Home button, and you
will see our new task switcher.

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:31.982 align:middle
It's really gorgeous.

00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:36.687 align:middle
Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:38.522 align:middle
Just move right into
Safari like this.

00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:40.657 align:middle
But of course, often when
I am in an app like Safari,

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:43.393 align:middle
I then just want to
quickly check my messages.

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:47.197 align:middle
So now with just a single
finger swipe from the side,

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:50.233 align:middle
I can slide it right in with
what we call Slide Over.

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.135 align:middle
Of course, it's fully
interactive.

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:55.138 align:middle
I can take a quick look,
maybe type a response,

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:57.207 align:middle
put it right back,
I am back in Safari.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.809 align:middle
Do that again.

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:04.214 align:middle
From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:04.214 align:middle
From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications.

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.615 align:middle
So let's bring in Calendar.

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:08.552 align:middle
Of course, fully interactive
so I can tap into another day.

00:58:08.552 --> 00:58:09.653 align:middle
Let's bring in another app.

00:58:09.653 --> 00:58:13.290 align:middle
I am going to bring
in the new Notes app.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.658 align:middle
Just like that.

00:58:14.658 --> 00:58:16.460 align:middle
Now, sometimes, of course, I
want to stay working in Notes

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.496 align:middle
and Safari both at the same
time, so I can just tap here

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:22.332 align:middle
on the divider, and
now I am in split view.

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:25.168 align:middle
They are both completely active.

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:29.005 align:middle
In fact, for the first time
ever, multiapp, Multi-Touch,

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.808 align:middle
I can move them both
at the same time.

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:38.348 align:middle
[Applause]

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:41.051 align:middle
Now, Notes is actually
pinned to the side now,

00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:42.786 align:middle
so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps.

00:58:42.786 --> 00:58:45.455 align:middle
I am just going to move
over here to Photos.

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:47.824 align:middle
You notice now I have Photos
with Notes on the side.

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.559 align:middle
This is really great if I am
taking notes while working

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:51.595 align:middle
across a bunch of experiences.

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:53.964 align:start
And of course those four-finger
gestures continue to work great,

00:58:53.964 --> 00:58:56.800 align:middle
so I can swipe my way
right back into Safari.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.703 align:middle
I can follow links, of
course, from my notes.

00:58:59.703 --> 00:59:03.874 align:middle
Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here

00:59:03.874 --> 00:59:04.808 align:middle
on the side.

00:59:04.808 --> 00:59:06.076 align:middle
I can adjust the split.

00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:08.545 align:middle
Let me move that over
to a nice 50/50 view

00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:10.147 align:middle
with Notes and Safari.

00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:11.815 align:middle
I can tap on links
to other apps,

00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:16.052 align:middle
so let's follow a
link into Maps.

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.455 align:middle
Maps -- I really want
location accuracy.

00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:20.791 align:middle
Thank you, very helpful.

00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:23.994 align:middle
Slides right in and
shows me the location.

00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:26.430 align:middle
I can follow another
link, Maps adjusts,

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.465 align:middle
I am able to stay
focused right here

00:59:28.465 --> 00:59:30.567 align:middle
in these two apps side by side.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:33.403 align:middle
Let's say I now want to
work Notes full screen.

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:35.472 align:middle
I can pull right
across like that

00:59:35.472 --> 00:59:37.107 align:middle
and I am in full-screen Notes.

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:38.542 align:middle
This gives me a great
opportunity

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:41.244 align:middle
to show you what's new with
the QuickType keyboard.

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.447 align:middle
I have a to-do list
I am building here.

00:59:43.447 --> 00:59:49.886 align:middle
I am going to add an item
here to buy a new ice chest.

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.087 align:middle
There we go.

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.590 align:middle
On second thought, I
should probably borrow one.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.258 align:middle
I am going to take two fingers

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.794 align:middle
down on the keyboard,
swipe over here.

00:59:57.794 --> 00:59:59.196 align:middle
I can reposition the
cursor like this.

00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.298 align:middle
Tap and make a selection.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.298 align:middle
Tap and make a selection.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:03.733 align:middle
Extend the selection.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.835 align:middle
And type "borrow."

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.102 align:middle
It's really easy.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.437 align:middle
I can make bigger moves too.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.540 align:middle
I can go to the top here, maybe
select the whole sentence,

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:16.112 align:middle
drag down, maybe do a checklist
like this, and check them off.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.247 align:middle
Just like that.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:18.915 align:middle
Super cool.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:23.987 align:middle
[Applause]

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:26.923 align:middle
Next I want to show you
multitasking in the context

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:30.560 align:middle
of something I think we all
do quite a bit on our iPads,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.831 align:middle
which is not that --
which is watching ESPN.

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.633 align:middle
So let's bring up a video.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:40.036 align:middle
I am going to play right here.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:43.473 align:middle
Now, often when I am watching
a video, I may decide I want

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.041 align:middle
to look something up
or check something

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:48.411 align:middle
or maybe even get a
notification, and I want you

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.880 align:middle
to watch what happens
when I tap.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.048 align:middle
Watch the video.

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:53.950 align:middle
Now I have Picture in Picture.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:01:00.190 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:00:53.950 --> 01:01:00.190 align:middle
[Applause]

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:04.594 align:middle
So I can still listen, I
can watch my video, I can,

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:08.365 align:middle
of course, resize the
PIP if I want, like this.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.001 align:middle
I can move it around the
screen so it's out of the way

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.802 align:middle
of what I am working on.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.138 align:middle
I can even move it off the side.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.474 align:middle
Sometimes I just want to listen
for a while while I work.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.243 align:middle
Of course, it stays
with me wherever I go.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.579 align:middle
I can pull it back,
and when I am done,

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:23.880 align:middle
just tap to put it away.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.985 align:middle
And that is Multitasking
in iOS 9.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:34.824 align:middle
[Applause]

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:38.061 align:middle
So iOS 9 delivers this great
app switcher, and of course,

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.531 align:middle
that's available
on iPhone as well.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.634 align:middle
On iPad, we have Slide
Over so you can bring apps

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.069 align:middle
in from the side.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.305 align:middle
You can tap and enter split view

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:52.275 align:middle
for simultaneous
live two apps up.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.945 align:middle
And of course, Picture
in Picture.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:58.415 align:middle
Now, we provide developer APIs
to let your apps work this way,

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:02.352 align:middle
and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:02.352 align:middle
and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.322 align:middle
because if you've adopted
Auto Layout and size classes

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:09.259 align:middle
to work great on the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus, well, that carries

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:13.597 align:middle
over just like this onto iPad.

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:16.466 align:middle
Twitter came in and was able
to do it just in minutes.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.069 align:middle
It was really incredible.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:24.207 align:middle
Now, Slide Over is available
for the iPad Air, Air 2, mini 2,

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.977 align:middle
and mini 3, as is
Picture in Picture,

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.546 align:middle
and our most powerful
split view is available

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:33.483 align:middle
on our most powerful
iPad, the iPad Air 2.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.051 align:middle
That's Multitasking.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:43.193 align:middle
[Applause]

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:46.429 align:middle
So we've seen some
great end-user features,

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.266 align:middle
but of course, we've also
focused on the foundations.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:56.206 align:middle
In performance, as you saw
earlier in El Capitan with OS X,

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:59.209 align:middle
we've taken the core frameworks
that we use for drawing

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.711 align:middle
on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.711 align:middle
on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:02.912 align:middle
and we put them on top of Metal.

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.914 align:middle
We are seeing great
acceleration,

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:08.685 align:middle
1.6 times improvements in
animations and scrolling,

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.621 align:middle
and a 50 percent reduction
in CPU usage for drawing.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.390 align:middle
It's really great.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.425 align:middle
With battery life, we focused

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:19.162 align:middle
on real-world use cases
and optimized them.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:23.400 align:middle
And we are seeing an addition
of one hour of typical use

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.102 align:middle
on a full charge on iPhone.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:30.507 align:middle
[Applause]

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.776 align:middle
Now, we know that for a lot
of you if you are running low

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:35.378 align:middle
on power, you start searching
all over for switches

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:37.213 align:middle
and turning off features
in the hope

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.350 align:middle
of extending your battery
life a little bit further.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.319 align:middle
Well, now in iOS 9, we
give you a single switch

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:46.356 align:middle
to enter what we call Low
Power mode, and it pulls levers

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.892 align:middle
that you didn't even
know existed and is able

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:53.463 align:middle
to extend battery life for
an additional three hours

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.965 align:middle
of typical use on top
of that additional hour.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.133 align:middle
It's really great.

01:03:57.133 --> 01:04:02.939 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:03:57.133 --> 01:04:02.939 align:middle
[Applause]

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.975 align:middle
Now, with security, we want
to protect our users' data

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.610 align:middle
on device and in the cloud,

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:10.246 align:middle
and so we are bringing
two-factor authentication

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:15.218 align:start
and making it easy for everyone
to protect their data in iCloud.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:20.423 align:middle
And with Software Update, we
want everyone to get to iOS 9,

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:24.527 align:middle
and so we've done major
enhancements to the architecture

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.796 align:middle
for our over-the-air
updates, and we have been able

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:31.134 align:middle
to reduce the amount of free
space you need to get to iOS 9

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:35.138 align:middle
from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.807 align:middle
down to just 1.3, so we
think everybody is going

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.175 align:middle
to be getting to iOS 9.

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:45.348 align:middle
[Applause]

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:48.351 align:middle
So iOS 9, intelligence
throughout the system,

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:53.123 align:middle
Apple Pay, enhancements to
really popular apps like Notes

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:58.528 align:middle
and Maps, an all-new News app,
and incredible features now

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:01.931 align:middle
for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:01.931 align:middle
for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course,

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.300 align:middle
enhancements to the foundations.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.272 align:middle
Now, iOS 9 is a great release
for our users, but once again,

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:13.510 align:middle
it's a fantastic release
for all of you developers,

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.011 align:middle
bringing a ton of new features.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.546 align:middle
You saw search extensibility.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:19.482 align:middle
We are adding UI
testing to Xcode.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:20.583 align:middle
[Cheers and applause] Yes!

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.687 align:middle
We have a new technology
called App Thinning,

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.857 align:middle
which optimizes your
downloads to exactly the subset

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:30.860 align:middle
of resources needed for that
user's device, so you are able

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.229 align:middle
to get -- take less
space on device.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:34.731 align:middle
It's really great.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.867 align:middle
Now, when it comes to gaming,
we've enhanced SpriteKit,

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:41.538 align:middle
SceneKit, and Metal and
introduced three new frameworks,

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:44.040 align:middle
GameplayKit to bring
artificial intelligence

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.378 align:middle
with path avoid obstacle
avoidance and path finding;

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.613 align:middle
Model I/O to provide
beautiful lighting

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.550 align:middle
on your 3D models;
and ReplayKit.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.685 align:middle
It lets you enhance
your applications

01:05:55.685 --> 01:06:00.190 align:middle
to let users record their game
play as video and share it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:05:55.685 --> 01:06:00.190 align:middle
to let users record their game
play as video and share it.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.258 align:middle
It's really great.

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:08.798 align:middle
[Applause]

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.468 align:middle
Now, HealthKit has been on
fire, so we've continued --

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.671 align:middle
well, we added water,
actually, to HealthKit.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.406 align:middle
We are not trying
to put out the fire.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:20.376 align:middle
We are adding lots of additional
health metrics to be tracked,

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:23.746 align:middle
for instance, hydration,
UV exposure,

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.481 align:middle
and reproductive health.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.252 align:middle
Now, HomeKit has been taking off

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.588 align:middle
with manufacturers
introducing HomeKit peripherals

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:36.759 align:start
to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:39.229 align:middle
And now in iOS 9, we
are adding support

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.232 align:middle
for window shades,
sensors of all kinds.

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:46.002 align:middle
For instance, carbon monoxide
sensors, motion sensors.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.873 align:middle
And we're adding support for
security systems as well.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:52.442 align:middle
Perhaps most importantly,
we are allowing you

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:57.247 align:middle
to access your home remotely
and securely via iCloud.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.049 align:middle
So no matter where you
are, you can control all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.049 align:middle
So no matter where you
are, you can control all

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:02.318 align:middle
of your HomeKit devices.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:09.559 align:middle
[Applause]

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.060 align:middle
Next, CarPlay.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:16.332 align:middle
So CarPlay supports audio
apps and now, in iOS 9,

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.936 align:middle
it also supports apps by the
automaker to control things

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:24.040 align:middle
in your own car without
leaving the CarPlay experience.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.542 align:middle
And CarPlay is supporting
more kinds of screens,

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.845 align:middle
wider aspect ratios, high DPI.

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:32.882 align:middle
But most significantly
with CarPlay,

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.251 align:middle
we are pulling the cord.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:38.388 align:middle
In future cars, you will
be able to get in your car

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:42.158 align:middle
without taking your phone out of
your bag or out of your pocket

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:46.095 align:middle
and start experiencing
CarPlay effortlessly.

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.364 align:middle
It's going to be really great.

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:53.369 align:middle
[Applause]

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:57.373 align:middle
Finally, let's talk about Swift.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:02.345 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:02.345 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:03.813 align:middle
You all know that the growth

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:07.417 align:middle
that Swift has been experiencing
is just unprecedented,

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.519 align:middle
and we've all seen
it with the flood

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:12.789 align:middle
of applications coming
in to the App Store.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:18.094 align:middle
Well, now we are stepping on
the gas this year with Swift 2.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.430 align:middle
Now, Swift was designed from
the beginning to be fast,

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.832 align:middle
and we've continued to roll

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:26.769 align:middle
out targeted optimizations all
year long, and now with Swift 2,

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.939 align:middle
we have an all-new optimization
technology that's especially

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.408 align:middle
great for complex applications
and object-oriented programming

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:36.412 align:middle
that we call Whole
Module Optimization,

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.816 align:middle
and the results are
really fantastic.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.452 align:middle
In addition, we are bringing
the language features

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.354 align:middle
that you've asked for most,

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.522 align:middle
an elegant new error
handling model,

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.323 align:middle
the ability to see
your interfaces

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:51.894 align:middle
as synthesized headers
in Xcode, and the feature

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:56.399 align:middle
that Tim has been begging for
all year, protocol extensions.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.102 align:middle
You are all going to love it.

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:04.607 align:middle
Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:04.607 align:middle
Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language,

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:07.076 align:middle
the one that we will
all be doing application

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:11.913 align:middle
and systems programming
on for 20 years to come.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:17.520 align:middle
And we think Swift should be
everywhere and used by everyone,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.555 align:middle
and so we're going to be
doing something really big.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:25.461 align:middle
Today we are announcing that
Swift will be open source.

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:34.537 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:51.854 align:middle
We will be rolling
out the compiler

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:56.959 align:middle
and the standard libraries
for iOS, OS X, and Linux.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:02.598 align:middle
And it will all be out there
by the end of the year.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:02.598 align:middle
And it will all be out there
by the end of the year.

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.534 align:middle
So that's Swift,
and that is iOS 9.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.770 align:middle
We are doing a developer
beta -- you guessed it --

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.940 align:middle
today, and for the first
time for a major iOS release,

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.811 align:middle
a public beta, so sign
up now at beta.apple.com,

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.146 align:middle
and you can get the beta
when it comes out in July.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:19.082 align:middle
And of course, we
will be rolling it

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:21.184 align:middle
out as a free upgrade
in the fall.

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:25.988 align:middle
And iOS 9 will support
all of the devices

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.690 align:middle
that were supported by iOS 8.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.092 align:middle
We are not dropping
any this year

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:32.028 align:middle
because we want everyone
to get iOS 9.

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.930 align:middle
[Applause]

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:34.831 align:middle
That's iOS 9.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.632 align:middle
I really appreciate your time.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:37.467 align:middle
Have a fantastic conference.

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:38.534 align:middle
Thank you.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:45.942 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:47.743 align:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks,
Craig.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.882 align:middle
iOS just keeps getting better
and better for our many hundreds

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:56.185 align:middle
of millions of users,
and iOS 9 takes it

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:59.222 align:middle
to an even greater level
with incredible new apps

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.458 align:middle
and intelligence
built right into iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.458 align:middle
and intelligence
built right into iOS.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:06.896 align:middle
And as an avid iPad user, I
am also incredibly excited

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:11.834 align:middle
about how far it extends the
iPad experience as we continue

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:14.971 align:middle
to lead in the post-PC era.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:18.841 align:middle
With El Capitan, we've
created a new version of OS X

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:22.011 align:middle
that dramatically
improves the experience

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:26.082 align:middle
and the user experience and the
performance of the Macintosh.

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.984 align:middle
And of course, Swift.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:32.622 align:middle
You've just heard Swift provides
a single language for you

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:38.294 align:middle
to create apps for
both OS X and iOS.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:42.431 align:middle
There's really so many
possibilities for you

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:46.335 align:middle
to use these platforms
and these tools

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:50.907 align:middle
to create unbelievable apps
that will impact business

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:56.746 align:start
and healthcare and education and
really everything in our lives.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:01.851 align:middle
There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:01.851 align:middle
There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:08.391 align:middle
And of course, underpinning
this, the App Store is very key.

01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:13.262 align:middle
It's hard to believe that the
App Store was launched only

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.264 align:middle
seven years ago.

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:18.401 align:middle
It's hard to remember
a day without it.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.603 align:middle
Now, I'm happy to announce

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:25.608 align:middle
that the App Store recently
passed a major milestone.

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:34.684 align:middle
The App Store has passed
100 billion apps downloads.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:41.524 align:middle
[Applause]

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:45.061 align:middle
The rate of growth
and the momentum is

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.597 align:middle
absolutely staggering.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:51.434 align:middle
The industry has never seen
anything like this before.

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:54.070 align:middle
The App Store has
forever changed software

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.872 align:middle
and software distribution.

01:12:56.872 --> 01:13:00.610 align:middle
And it's also been
an economic boon.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

And it's also been
an economic boon.

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:04.680 align:middle
We've now paid over $30
billion to developers.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:09.051 align:middle
[Applause]

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.553 align:middle
The App Store continues

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:17.126 align:middle
to be the most profitable app
marketplace on the planet.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start
Now, we could not be more proud
of the work that you are doing.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.072 align:middle
More and more, developers
are transforming, empowering,

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.608 align:middle
and reimagining the
very important things

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:35.745 align:middle
that we do in our daily lives.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:41.317 align:middle
We've made a video about
your incredible impact

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:46.188 align:middle
and just how far you've come
in such a short period of time,

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.724 align:middle
and I'd love to run
it for you now.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.002 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.002 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched,

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.337 align:middle
it didn't have an App Store.

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:06.509 align:middle
And there was tremendous desire
on the part of developers

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.544 align:middle
and customers for Apple

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.913 align:middle
to let third-party
applications be created.

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:15.151 align:middle
We all had this dream
that apps were going

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:19.522 align:middle
to become really important,
but it took some time

01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:22.625 align:middle
to realize how they would affect
everything that we care about,

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:27.963 align:middle
and as that cumulative effect
appeared, then we all start

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.099 align:middle
to realize, oh, my
goodness, this is bigger

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.134 align:middle
than any of us imagined.

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:41.344 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Apps plus handheld
devices,

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:45.414 align:middle
I think that's a watershed
moment in civilization.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.916 align:middle
I put it up there
with the invention

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.784 align:middle
of the microscope
and the telescope.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:56.158 align:middle
We live in a time where the most
powerful tools ever imagined

01:14:56.158 --> 01:15:00.129 align:middle
to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:14:56.158 --> 01:15:00.129 align:middle
to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand

01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:02.264 align:middle
of essentially everyone.

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.402 align:middle
&gt;&gt; If you think the Industrial
Revolution was transformational,

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.437 align:middle
the App Store is way bigger.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:11.674 align:middle
I don't think we've seen
anything reach a mass adoption

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.109 align:middle
at anything close to this pace.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:16.946 align:middle
It took, for example,
electricity over a hundred years

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:19.348 align:middle
to get to its first
50 million users.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:22.852 align:middle
It took television 13
years, and the App Store got

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.354 align:middle
to 50 million users
in only 17 months.

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.868 align:middle
&gt;&gt; The thing the App
Store did was give each

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.469 align:middle
and every developer a voice.

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:44.140 align:middle
It's a testament that two
guys in a room working

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.543 align:middle
on an idea can launch an app
and instantly have hundreds

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.078 align:middle
of millions of people
very quickly.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:54.784 align:middle
The iPhone made photography
universally accessible.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.559 align:middle
&gt;&gt; I cannot think
of a single industry

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.528 align:middle
that doesn't need an app.

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:07.596 align:middle
People want data at
their fingertips.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.865 align:middle
They want personalized
experiences.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.202 align:middle
They want power over
their money.

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:16.772 align:middle
And it's not just for banking;
it's for every industry.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:19.508 align:middle
The App Store has fundamentally
shifted how we all need

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:20.342 align:middle
to deliver.

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:23.412 align:middle
It's leveling the playing field.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.118 align:middle
&gt;&gt; We don't have to own
things.

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:31.420 align:middle
We don't have to
own our own cars.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.489 align:middle
We don't have to
own our own music.

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:37.226 align:middle
We can call it up
when we need it.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.495 align:middle
That's a big change, all
flowing from the idea

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:42.264 align:middle
of not just convenience
but people building

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.700 align:middle
up an infrastructure
around that.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.937 align:middle
We are now talking
not about hundreds

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:52.208 align:middle
of people getting the benefits
of an idea, but millions.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.748 align:middle
&gt;&gt; If you had told me when I
was a kid that you would be able

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:04.553 align:middle
to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it

to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.722 align:middle
to the world on a device
that you could also put

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:10.092 align:middle
in your pocket, I would
never have stopped laughing,

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.862 align:middle
and I would have
thought you were insane.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:15.130 align:middle
The App Store gives
everyone access

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:19.068 align:middle
to incredibly powerful tools,

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:22.171 align:middle
and there's an incredible
generation of filmmakers

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:24.106 align:middle
and storytellers to come.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:37.253 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Kids love technology,
and they love interacting

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:40.890 align:middle
with the iPad and with apps.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:44.860 align:middle
That wonder and awe that gets
ignited is actually being

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.030 align:middle
utilized to help
that person learn.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.432 align:middle
Certainly in education
there's so much potential

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:53.769 align:middle
to take the classroom
with you anywhere.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:00.776 align:middle

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:00.776 align:middle
&gt;&gt; We all know we are
in this magic moment.

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:05.180 align:middle
There are so many incredible
apps, and they do things

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.517 align:middle
for people that change
their lives.

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.221 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Music for me,
it's like everything.

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:13.556 align:middle
It's really special.

01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:21.163 align:middle
This amazing feeling that
music gives me, I want everyone

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:25.267 align:middle
to have that, even if
the person cannot hear.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:32.341 align:middle
So the idea of the app is to
introduce music for deaf people.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:38.047 align:middle
I am going to put these on
your wrist, so if you play,

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:42.418 align:middle
you can feel the vibrations.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.553 align:middle
&gt;&gt; I can
feel it.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.556 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Did you feel
that, Rob?

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:57.366 align:middle
My dream is to bring
music to everyone.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:04.807 align:middle
&gt;&gt; It is an amazing
time to be a developer.

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:07.509 align:middle
We are still just at the
beginning of all this,

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:11.614 align:middle
this moment where the technology
of an iPhone and an iPad

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:16.485 align:middle
and the Watch enable so
many incredible things.

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:21.657 align:middle
There's so much that can
still change and evolve due

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:24.059 align:middle
to the power of applications.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:33.135 align:middle
[Music]

01:19:54.590 --> 01:20:03.666 align:middle
[Applause]

[Applause]

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:09.905 align:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: On behalf
of everyone at Apple,

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.840 align:middle
we want to thank the
developer community

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.542 align:middle
for everything that you've done.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.110 align:middle
Thank you.

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:18.280 align:middle
[Applause]

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:22.451 align:middle
You have changed so many
parts of all of our lives

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:28.691 align:middle
and transformed the
world in the process.

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:32.995 align:middle
Now, we want to talk about
now the next opportunity

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.396 align:middle
to transform the world.

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:40.969 align:middle
And that's the opportunity to
bring native apps to the Watch

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:44.139 align:middle
with a new version of watchOS.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:49.678 align:middle
[Applause]

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:54.950 align:middle
For us, this is a giant moment.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:59.555 align:middle
This is how we felt when
we launched the App Store.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:02.658 align:middle
Opening a new platform
to developers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:02.658 align:middle
Opening a new platform
to developers

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:07.429 align:middle
to create new applications

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:10.999 align:middle
that can really change
people's lives.

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:13.102 align:middle
We really believe
deeply in this space.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:17.539 align:middle
We believe in technology
designed for the wrist.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.808 align:middle
And we believe by
opening up the platform

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:25.114 align:middle
that you will create
new and powerful uses

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:28.350 align:middle
that today we can
only begin to imagine.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:33.922 align:middle
We began making the Apple Watch
available just six weeks ago,

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:38.861 align:middle
and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:43.031 align:middle
about the next version
of the watchOS.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:48.003 align:middle
This new version will have
great new capabilities,

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:52.407 align:middle
and it will bring native
apps right to your wrist.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:57.012 align:middle
To tell you all about it, I'd
like to invite up my friend

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:59.448 align:middle
and colleague Kevin Lynch.

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:00.215 align:middle
Kevin.

Kevin.

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:05.053 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.555 align:middle
&gt;&gt; KEVIN
LYNCH: Hi.

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:11.760 align:middle
So we're moving really fast on
watchOS, and I am super excited

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.796 align:middle
to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:15.330 align:middle
in watchOS, as well

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.133 align:middle
as the powerful new
abilities for app development.

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:20.569 align:middle
Let's start with
the enhancements.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:24.239 align:middle
The enhancements include
great new Timepiece functions,

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:27.176 align:middle
improvements in communication
as well as in Health &amp; Fitness,

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:28.944 align:middle
and support for the
new capabilities

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.613 align:middle
in Apple Pay, Maps, and Siri.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.816 align:middle
Let's start with Timepiece.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:36.819 align:middle
Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece,

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:39.521 align:start
the most customizable one in the
world, and a lot of that is due

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.757 align:middle
to the Watch faces and
how you can change them.

01:22:41.757 --> 01:22:44.927 align:middle
We are adding some new
Watch faces in watchOS 2.

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:47.629 align:middle
That includes a beautiful
new Photos face to be able

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.332 align:middle
to select any photo you have and
create a Watch face out of it.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:53.902 align:start
You can create more than one and
switch between them as you like.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.637 align:middle
Or you can select a photo album,

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:56.972 align:middle
and every time you
raise your wrist,

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.274 align:middle
you will see a different
photo from your album show up.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:02.444 align:middle
It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:02.444 align:middle
It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day.

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.880 align:middle
We went a little
further with this,

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.315 align:middle
and we shot some
photos ourselves.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.850 align:middle
We did some time-lapse
photography

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.419 align:middle
in some beautiful
locations around the world.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.321 align:middle
The way this works is
when you raise your wrist,

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.590 align:middle
you will see this
24-hour shoot we have done

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:17.426 align:middle
in different locations, and it
will be the current time there.

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:19.328 align:middle
If it's in noon, you
will see noon in London.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.697 align:middle
If it's night, you'll
see Big Ben all lit up.

01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:23.065 align:middle
We've done this not
only for London,

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:24.700 align:middle
but some other locations too.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.902 align:middle
You can choose from
Hong Kong, Mack Lake --

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:28.570 align:middle
which a beautiful
place in the Sierras --

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.107 align:middle
as well as New York,
Shanghai, and London.

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:34.943 align:middle
It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.678 align:middle
and these time-lapse
images, on your wrist.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:40.215 align:middle
You can customize your
Watch with these images

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:42.317 align:middle
but you can also choose to
show the information that you

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.853 align:middle
like on your Watch
face with something

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.190 align:middle
in traditional Watch terms
that's called Complications.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:52.094 align:middle
With watchOS 2, we are really
excited to enable app developers

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:54.329 align:middle
to make your own Complications.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:24:01.270 align:middle
[Applause]

[Applause]

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:03.906 align:middle
So be able to do things
like show your flight time

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:07.142 align:middle
from United, see the state
of your home control system,

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.411 align:middle
look at the charge level
of your electric car,

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:12.147 align:middle
or see sports scores, for
example, from the MLB app.

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.715 align:middle
You can choose the
information that you most

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.651 align:middle
like to see right
on your Watch face.

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:17.419 align:middle
It's going to be
really, really cool.

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.588 align:middle
And this will work not
only on the modular face

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:21.990 align:middle
but across the others that
support Complications as well.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.393 align:middle
You will be able to choose
from a variety of templates,

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.161 align:middle
and we'll make those
look beautiful in each

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.063 align:middle
of the different Watch faces.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.464 align:middle
So it's going to be
a really fast way

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.333 align:middle
to look at this information.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:32.434 align:middle
Now, we went further than this.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.102 align:middle
We thought it's really
great to be able

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:35.804 align:middle
to see the current information,

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:37.239 align:middle
but what about future
information,

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.942 align:middle
like the weather later
today or your meeting

01:24:39.942 --> 01:24:41.910 align:middle
after the current one?

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.079 align:middle
And what if you could go
forward in time and actually see

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.848 align:middle
that information update
on your Watch face?

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.617 align:middle
Well, we are supporting
that in watchOS 2

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.420 align:middle
with something we
call Time Travel.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.722 align:middle
And you will be able to
rotate your Digital Crown,

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:56.291 align:middle
and you can go both forward
and backward through time,

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:59.428 align:middle
and the information will
update right on your screen.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:00.862 align:middle
Let's take a look here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:00.862 align:middle
Let's take a look here.

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:03.432 align:middle
So I've got my meeting in
the middle there and weather

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.901 align:middle
and the charge level of
the car and time in London.

01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:08.670 align:middle
When I rotate the Crown, you
can see it's changing the time

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.906 align:middle
and showing me things
that are coming up.

01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:13.075 align:middle
Now, we know a really popular
one here might be the stocks

01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:15.243 align:middle
Complication, but we
haven't cracked that one yet.

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:19.147 align:middle
We are working on it.

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.116 align:middle
You can keep rotating,
keep going forward,

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.451 align:middle
get all the way to tonight.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.353 align:middle
You can see I have a date
night tonight, weather is going

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:27.022 align:start
to be good, time in London will
be 2:00 a.m. You can see all the

01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:30.192 align:middle
information you like to see in
the time you want to look at it.

01:25:30.192 --> 01:25:32.694 align:middle
Really, really fun
way to interact

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:35.063 align:middle
with time on your Watch.

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:37.432 align:middle
That's Time Travel.

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:42.871 align:middle
[Applause]

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.540 align:middle
Now, we also thought, What
would be a great experience

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.243 align:middle
for the Watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging?

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.345 align:middle
Well, we've come up with a
new user interface for this

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:52.981 align:middle
in watchOS 2 called
Nightstand Mode.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.183 align:middle
When you put your Watch on
its side and it's charging,

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:57.652 align:middle
you will get this beautiful
display now of the time,

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.688 align:middle
and of course, you can set
an alarm that will wake you

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:03.191 align:middle
up in the morning, and it
will go something like this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:03.191 align:middle
up in the morning, and it
will go something like this.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:05.394 align:middle
[Alarm tone]

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:07.496 align:middle
So a beautiful little
bedside alarm clock now

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.065 align:middle
with Apple Watch, and
the buttons on the side

01:26:10.065 --> 01:26:13.602 align:middle
and the Crown act as your
Snooze and your Off button.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:17.105 align:middle
A really fun way to have a
Nightstand view on your Watch.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:19.808 align:middle
Those are some of the great
new Timepiece functions

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:22.377 align:middle
that are coming in watchOS 2.

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.979 align:middle
Let's look at communication.

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:25.347 align:middle
Now, already Apple
Watch is great

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.015 align:middle
at communicating
with your friends.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:30.052 align:middle
You can just press the side
button and see your 12 friends

01:26:30.052 --> 01:26:31.420 align:middle
that you have selected.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.555 align:middle
Now, we realize that some of
you have more than 12 friends,

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:36.558 align:middle
so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:39.227 align:middle
of friends you can select,
and you can add a friend right

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.129 align:middle
from your Watch by
pressing the plus sign

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:43.732 align:middle
and add a friend right there.

01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:45.500 align:middle
Isn't that cool?

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.570 align:middle
[Applause]

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.938 align:middle
Now, when you are
communicating with someone,

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:52.574 align:middle
you can make a phone call or
send a message or send a drawing

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:55.677 align:middle
with Digital Touch, and now
in watchOS 2, you will be able

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.546 align:middle
to use multiple colors
in your drawings,

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.481 align:middle
so you can draw a
beautiful flower

01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:01.883 align:middle
that has more than
just one color.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:01.883 align:middle
that has more than
just one color.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:05.387 align:middle
Even my drawings are starting
to look better now with this.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:06.455 align:middle
Also an email.

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:08.123 align:middle
You can already read
email on your Watch.

01:27:08.123 --> 01:27:11.526 align:middle
With watchOS 2, you will
be able to reply to email.

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:16.064 align:middle
[Applause]

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.933 align:middle
And with the phone, you can
already take phone calls

01:27:17.933 --> 01:27:19.034 align:middle
on your Watch.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:20.502 align:middle
We are now going to
support FaceTime Audio,

01:27:20.502 --> 01:27:22.537 align:middle
so you will get really
high-fidelity calls right

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:23.538 align:middle
on your wrist.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:28.343 align:middle
[Applause]

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:29.911 align:middle
And with Health &amp; Fitness,

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.848 align:middle
already Apple Watch is a great
partner for Health &amp; Fitness.

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:36.251 align:middle
With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.853 align:middle
to run natively on the Watch

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:40.889 align:middle
so you can use them wherever
you are, and your workouts

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.991 align:middle
with these apps will
contribute directly

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:45.360 align:middle
to your all-day activity,
which will be really great,

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.562 align:middle
so if you go on a bike
ride, it will count.

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:50.465 align:middle
[Applause]

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:52.934 align:middle
We are also enabling
Siri to start workouts,

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.137 align:middle
so you can just raise your
wrist and say, hey, Siri,

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:56.538 align:middle
start a 30-minute
run in the park,

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:59.608 align:middle
and it will start the Workout
app and get it going for you.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.211 align:middle
You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride"

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.211 align:middle
You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride"

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:06.515 align:middle
or "go for a 5-mile run, "
and it will start the workout

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:08.550 align:middle
for you without having to
touch the watch at all.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:10.118 align:middle
When you achieve something,

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.721 align:middle
there are some beautiful new
achievements you will see

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:14.189 align:middle
that look like this.

01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:15.957 align:middle
They spin right in, they're
beautiful, you can play

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.826 align:middle
with them in 3D on the
Watch, they are engraved

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:20.962 align:middle
on the back now with your
name, and you can share these

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:24.065 align:middle
with people over Messages,
Facebook, or Twitter.

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:28.603 align:middle
Really cool Health &amp;
Fitness.

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:31.940 align:middle
[Applause]

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.441 align:middle
With Apple Pay, you saw some

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.143 align:middle
of the great new
support we are bringing

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.645 align:middle
for store cards and
rewards cards.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.213 align:middle
We are supporting
that in the Watch,

01:28:38.213 --> 01:28:40.815 align:middle
so you can select a store card
and use it right in your Watch

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.951 align:middle
in a merchant terminal
just by waving it

01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:44.085 align:middle
at the store stand there.

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.955 align:middle
And with Wallet coming to Watch,

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:48.690 align:middle
all of your rewards cards
will be right there,

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.659 align:middle
and you can also use those
right from your Watch

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.494 align:middle
as you are doing purchases.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.796 align:middle
With Transit, we are
supporting, of course,

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:57.599 align:middle
the mass transit capabilities
in Maps now, so you will be able

01:28:57.599 --> 01:28:59.467 align:middle
to see the transit
lines on your wrist.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:01.102 align:middle
You can actually see
the departure times

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:01.102 align:middle
You can actually see
the departure times

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.704 align:middle
for different stations
you are near.

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:05.407 align:middle
When you are navigating, you
will get step-by-step directions

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:08.410 align:middle
about getting through the
different mass transit you use.

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:11.580 align:middle
With Siri, we are continuing
to add new domains for Siri.

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.782 align:middle
In watchOS 2, we
are enabling Siri

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:16.184 align:middle
to get you mass transit
directions, like bus directions

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.953 align:middle
to the Ferry Building,
which will look like this

01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:19.654 align:middle
and you can just
start navigating.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:22.390 align:middle
Or you can control things
in your home with Siri,

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.093 align:middle
you can say things like "hey
Siri set the dinner scene,"

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.562 align:middle
and it will talk to any
HomeKit-enabled devices

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:30.532 align:middle
in your house and set the
lights just how you want them.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.834 align:middle
Isn't that cool?

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.669 align:middle
It's going to be great.

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:38.206 align:middle
[Applause]

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.375 align:middle
Another great thing is you
can actually ask for any

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.011 align:middle
of the Glances you have,
so you can say "hey, Siri,

01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:45.180 align:middle
show me the Instagram
Glance," and it will show

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.514 align:middle
up right on your Watch face.

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:49.017 align:middle
This could be a glance you
don't have currently selected.

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:50.885 align:middle
It's a great way
to show information

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:54.456 align:middle
from third-party apps
right there in Siri.

01:29:54.456 --> 01:29:55.890 align:middle
So those are just
some of the highlights

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.325 align:middle
of what's coming in watchOS 2.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.326 align:middle
We think it's going
to be a really,

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:01.429 align:middle
really great update
to the Watch.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:01.429 align:middle
really great update
to the Watch.

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.697 align:middle
Now, that's not all.

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:06.635 align:middle
[Applause]

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:09.938 align:middle
We also, of course, focused on
what we can do for developers,

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:12.907 align:middle
and already, out of the gate
on day one, you can build apps

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:15.210 align:middle
for Apple Watch using
something called WatchKit,

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:19.147 align:middle
and that has enabled many
thousands of apps now

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:22.384 align:middle
to be created for Apple Watch,
and these apps today function

01:30:22.384 --> 01:30:24.019 align:middle
by relying on your phone.

01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:26.154 align:middle
So you might have, for
example, an app on your Watch

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.256 align:middle
and the user interface
runs on your phone

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:30.892 align:middle
and the user interface is on
your Watch, but all the logic

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:33.328 align:middle
for your app today
runs on your phone.

01:30:33.328 --> 01:30:35.964 align:middle
With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:38.667 align:middle
to the watch so both the
UI and the logic are there,

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:41.303 align:middle
it will all run locally,
performance will be great,

01:30:41.303 --> 01:30:42.671 align:middle
responsiveness will be great,

01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:45.040 align:middle
it's going to be a great new
frontier for apps on Apple Watch

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.741 align:middle
with native app support.

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:53.214 align:middle
[Applause]

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:56.117 align:start
When you are actually wandering
away from your phone sometimes,

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.686 align:middle
your apps will be able
to communicate directly

01:30:57.686 --> 01:30:59.721 align:middle
with the network with
known Wi-Fi networks,

01:30:59.721 --> 01:31:01.690 align:middle
so you can get the information
you want wherever you are

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:59.721 --> 01:31:01.690 align:middle
so you can get the information
you want wherever you are

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:03.758 align:middle
with your Watch.

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:07.929 align:middle
[Applause]

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:10.065 align:middle
So we heard from you as we
were working on native apps,

01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:11.866 align:middle
a lot of feature requests
of things you would

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.001 align:middle
like to do on the Watch.

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:15.003 align:middle
These are a bunch of the
things that we've heard.

01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:16.471 align:middle
So we've been listening to that.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.073 align:middle
Let's go through
some of the things

01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:20.241 align:middle
that will be possible
now in watchOS 2.

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.643 align:middle
You can see how we did on this.

01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:24.079 align:middle
So one of the things we
heard was really wanted

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:26.614 align:middle
to access the microphone
on the Watch.

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:29.417 align:middle
So yes, in watchOS 2, you can
access the microphone right

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:32.787 align:middle
on the Watch and bring that
audio right into your app.

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:35.824 align:middle
[Applause]

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:38.259 align:middle
We also heard you want to
play audio out of the speaker.

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.394 align:middle
You can do that.

01:31:39.394 --> 01:31:40.929 align:middle
WatchOS 2 with native
apps, you can play back

01:31:40.929 --> 01:31:43.498 align:middle
through the Watch speaker
or you can play audio

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.567 align:middle
to a Bluetooth headset
or speaker connected,

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:47.936 align:middle
both short-form and
long-form audio.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:49.704 align:middle
Video. We know you
wanted to play video.

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:52.107 align:middle
You can play back short-form
video right on the Watch face.

01:31:52.107 --> 01:31:55.143 align:middle
It looks beautiful
on the Watch display.

01:31:55.143 --> 01:31:56.745 align:middle
Access to HealthKit.

01:31:56.745 --> 01:31:58.079 align:middle
We definitely heard that.

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.782 align:middle
You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.782 align:middle
You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch,

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:03.485 align:middle
including streaming heart rate
data, so if you are doing,

01:32:03.485 --> 01:32:05.286 align:middle
for example, a bike
ride with Strava,

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:08.823 align:start
you can see what heart rate zone
you are in while you are biking.

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:14.195 align:middle
[Applause]

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.865 align:middle
HomeKit is natively on the Watch
so you will be able to talk

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.367 align:middle
to your HomeKit devices from
your Watch and control them.

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:20.835 align:middle
We think this is going
to be a great future

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.103 align:middle
for control right
from your wrist.

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:24.873 align:middle
You will be able to
access the Accelerometer

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:26.374 align:middle
so you can get movement data.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.310 align:middle
So for example, from the iPING
golf app here, you can check

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:31.012 align:middle
out your golf swing tempo

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:34.682 align:middle
as you are swinging the golf
club with your Watch on.

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:37.819 align:middle
Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.488 align:middle
of focused work on to make it a
great experience on the wrist.

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.024 align:middle
We are bringing access to
the Taptic Engine for you

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:44.492 align:middle
for your app development.

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.061 align:middle
You will be able to choose from
a range of different feelings

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.431 align:middle
as well as audio that
will come out the speaker.

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.766 align:middle
So for example, if I am
unlocking my car here,

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:54.869 align:middle
I will get feedback on my
wrist, both audio and felt.

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:57.639 align:middle
Just like that.

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.675 align:start
Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.675 align:start
Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:04.012 align:start
to manipulate the UI, and we are
enabling access to Digital Crown

01:33:04.012 --> 01:33:05.180 align:middle
as well with watchOS 2.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.116 align:middle
You will be able to
control custom UI element

01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:09.818 align:middle
like changing the
temperature here just

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:11.820 align:middle
by rotating the Crown like this.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:14.889 align:middle
Super easy way to
interact with your Watch.

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:20.128 align:middle
[Applause]

01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:22.130 align:middle
So we've done a great job
bringing a lot of access

01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:23.565 align:middle
to the Watch now
with native apps.

01:33:23.565 --> 01:33:26.901 align:middle
I would like to show you a
demo now with some examples.

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:31.539 align:middle
[Applause]

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:34.476 align:middle
So I've got a Watch here,
and I am going to put it on.

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:37.779 align:middle
It's connected to the display
here through this little cable.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:39.547 align:middle
All right.

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:43.852 align:middle
Let's start by looking at
three examples of new features

01:33:43.852 --> 01:33:46.788 align:middle
in watchOS 2, then I
will show you three apps.

01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:48.890 align:middle
Let's start with
making a photo face,

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:52.994 align:middle
so I will press my Digital Crown
here, go to the Home screen.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.128 align:middle
There's my Photos.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:56.898 align:middle
You can see I've got a
bunch of photos on here.

01:33:56.898 --> 01:33:59.334 align:middle
I can zoom in with
the Crown, pan around,

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:00.535 align:middle
and I can pick a photo

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:00.535 align:middle
and I can pick a photo

01:34:00.535 --> 01:34:03.037 align:middle
that might make a nice
Watch face like that one.

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:04.506 align:middle
I want to zoom in and
crop it a little more.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:06.875 align:middle
I am going to zoom in a
little more, move it over like

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.176 align:middle
that to get it just right.

01:34:08.176 --> 01:34:10.245 align:middle
I think that's going to
make a great Watch face,

01:34:10.245 --> 01:34:13.848 align:middle
so I just Force Touch,
choose Create Watch Face,

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:15.950 align:middle
and there you go, a
beautiful new Watch face.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:21.389 align:middle
[Applause]

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:22.323 align:middle
Let's look at Time Travel.

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:24.025 align:middle
I will go over to
my modular face,

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.527 align:middle
got some more information here.

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:27.295 align:middle
I have flight times
here on United.

01:34:27.295 --> 01:34:28.596 align:middle
I can see the temperature,

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:31.866 align:middle
my VW car's charge
level, and time in London.

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:35.236 align:middle
So I just rotate the Crown
here, I can go forward in time.

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.504 align:middle
Time is updating.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.740 align:middle
My flight is leaving,
you can see, at 1:45.

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.709 align:start
I wonder if my charge level will
be enough to get to the airport.

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:45.246 align:middle
So if I keep going forward in
time here, we will get to 1:45,

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:47.315 align:middle
and you can see my charge
level is just going to be great

01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:48.783 align:middle
to get to the airport.

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.818 align:middle
In fact, you can keep going
and look at boarding time

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.053 align:middle
and arrival time
for your flight.

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.088 align:middle
So you can get a great
preview of your day just

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.090 align:middle
by rotating the Crown
right on the Watch face.

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.426 align:middle
It's a lot of fun.

01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:01.062 align:middle
Just press the Crown
and go back to Home.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:01.062 align:middle
Just press the Crown
and go back to Home.

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:04.566 align:middle
If you get an email, you can
reply to email now in watchOS 2.

01:35:04.566 --> 01:35:08.236 align:middle
Here is an email that's
just come in from Marc.

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:10.805 align:middle
I can reply to this by pressing
the button right below the

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.241 align:middle
message, or you can
use Siri to reply

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:15.677 align:middle
to a message right
from a notification.

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:20.682 align:middle
If I just use Siri here,
I can reply like this.

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:28.690 align:middle
Reply: I would love to.

01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:30.825 align:middle
So Siri is making
the message there.

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:32.160 align:middle
It's created a response.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.996 align:middle
I just press Send, and
it now goes off to Marc.

01:35:34.996 --> 01:35:36.965 align:middle
So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri

01:35:36.965 --> 01:35:39.434 align:middle
to send a message
right from your wrist.

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:41.269 align:middle
Now, let's look at a
few third-party apps.

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:44.272 align:middle
Let's look at the VW app you
saw on slides a second ago.

01:35:44.272 --> 01:35:46.441 align:middle
I will show you how that works.

01:35:46.441 --> 01:35:49.077 align:middle
Here it is.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:50.478 align:middle
Now, I can lock my car just

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.180 align:middle
by pressing this
control right here.

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.148 align:middle
It responds right away.

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.817 align:middle
You can see the app also
opened very quickly.

01:35:55.817 --> 01:35:57.652 align:middle
And I can control
the temperature here

01:35:57.652 --> 01:36:00.188 align:middle
that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:35:57.652 --> 01:36:00.188 align:middle
that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:02.123 align:middle
You can see how responsive
it is as I go up and down

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:02.890 align:middle
through temperatures here.

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.258 align:middle
Really, really cool.

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:06.160 align:middle
I will get it nice and warm for
me so when I get down there,

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.495 align:middle
it will be nice and toasty.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:08.496 align:middle
Okay. Turn it on.

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.565 align:middle
All right.

01:36:10.565 --> 01:36:12.634 align:middle
I've got confirmation
that it actually enabled

01:36:12.634 --> 01:36:14.202 align:middle
that on my car now.

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.971 align:middle
Access to the mic is going
to be really helpful in apps,

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.940 align:middle
and some of the apps that will
really benefit are communication

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.308 align:middle
apps like We Chat.

01:36:20.308 --> 01:36:23.511 align:middle
A lot of messages sent via
WeChat are audio messages,

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:26.748 align:middle
so let's see how that
will work with watchOS 2.

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:29.250 align:middle
I have a message from Becky.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:32.220 align:middle
I can reply by pressing
the Reply button,

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.788 align:middle
and you can see I've
got a microphone now

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.523 align:middle
so I can do an audio response.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.892 align:middle
Let's do that.

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:41.195 align:middle
That sounds great.

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:44.599 align:middle
You can see as I was recording
it, it got the audio levels

01:36:44.599 --> 01:36:47.168 align:middle
of my voice and now
it sent that to Becky.

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:48.870 align:middle
I can also reply
with stickers here.

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:50.905 align:middle
There's different
categories of them.

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:54.308 align:middle
With the Digital Crown now
being able to connect to the UI,

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:57.745 align:middle
I can flip through recent
stickers, pick one quickly

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.448 align:middle
that I like, and just
send that one as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.448 align:middle
that I like, and just
send that one as well.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:02.116 align:middle
So very fast to interact now

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:05.386 align:middle
with all these new controls you
have available in watchOS 2.

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:07.922 align:middle
Now, let's look at
the Vine glance.

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:11.993 align:middle
Vine is a great example of
playing back video on the Watch,

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:15.363 align:middle
and its format is really
perfect for the Watch face.

01:37:15.363 --> 01:37:18.399 align:middle
Here is a recent one on Vine.

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.176 align:middle
So that's video playing back
right on the Watch face.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.812 align:middle
So those are just some
examples of what you can do now

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:32.980 align:middle
with watchOS 2, and
I am super excited

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.149 align:middle
to see what all you guys
do with all this stuff.

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:43.624 align:middle
[Applause]

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.093 align:middle
So some great new
enhancements coming,

01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:48.296 align:middle
as well as some super powerful
app development tools for you.

01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:50.198 align:middle
And we've been working
really hard on this,

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:53.067 align:middle
and I am really happy to say
that this stuff is all available

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:56.170 align:middle
to you today to start
building these native apps.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:00.374 align:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:00.374 align:middle
[Applause]

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:02.677 align:middle
Just six weeks from our
launch, it's unbelievable.

01:38:02.677 --> 01:38:06.013 align:middle
Then it will be available
in the fall to everyone,

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:07.582 align:middle
and we will work
across all the watches,

01:38:07.582 --> 01:38:10.084 align:middle
of course, and it will be free.

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.753 align:middle
So this has been
a great adventure.

01:38:11.753 --> 01:38:13.755 align:middle
We are just getting
started here,

01:38:13.755 --> 01:38:15.890 align:middle
and I am really looking forward
to the journey ahead with all

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.225 align:middle
of you on Apple Watch.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.025 align:middle
Thank you very much.

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:19.060 align:middle
Back to Tim.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.429 align:middle
[Applause]

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:22.230 align:middle
Thank you, Tim.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:26.234 align:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks,
Kevin.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:28.836 align:middle
We're really excited to have
Apple Watch out in the world,

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:32.907 align:middle
and we can't wait to see
what you do with watchOS.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:36.778 align:middle
And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers

01:38:36.778 --> 01:38:41.449 align:middle
and users will use the powerful
ecosystems of both products

01:38:41.449 --> 01:38:46.954 align:middle
and platforms, three
amazing platforms.

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:50.992 align:middle
The opportunities
really are limitless.

01:38:50.992 --> 01:39:00.067 align:middle
Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ...

01:38:50.992 --> 01:39:00.067 align:middle
Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ...

01:39:01.002 --> 01:39:02.236 align:middle
one more thing.

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:08.743 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:39:08.743 --> 01:39:11.345 align:middle
I'd like to tell
you about something

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.548 align:middle
that we've been working
really hard on

01:39:13.548 --> 01:39:17.051 align:middle
and something we are
super excited about.

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:22.023 align:middle
You know, we love music, and
music is such an important part

01:39:22.023 --> 01:39:26.093 align:middle
of our lives and our culture.

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:30.431 align:middle
We've had a long relationship
with music at Apple,

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:34.068 align:middle
and music has had a very
rich history of change,

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:36.804 align:middle
some of which we've
played a part in.

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:40.541 align:middle
We've made a great video
about the history of music,

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:44.212 align:middle
and I would like to play
it for you this morning.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:59.360 align:middle

[Cheers and applause]

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:26.514 align:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Today we're
announcing Apple Music,

01:41:26.514 --> 01:41:31.118 align:middle
the next chapter in music, and
I know you are going to love it.

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:35.690 align:middle
It will change the way that
you experience music forever.

01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:40.027 align:middle
To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:42.063 align:middle
who knows more about music

01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:46.267 align:middle
and the music experience
than anyone I know.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:50.838 align:middle
He's worked with amazing
artists from Bruce Springsteen

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:54.342 align:middle
to John Lennon and
countless others.

01:41:54.342 --> 01:41:58.512 align:middle
We are thrilled to have him
a part of the Apple team.

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:00.948 align:middle
Please join me in
welcoming Jimmy Iovine.

&gt;&gt; JIMMY IOVINE:
Thanks, Tim.

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.062 align:middle
Well, it's really
an honor to be here.

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:17.098 align:middle
I'm here because in 2003,

01:42:17.098 --> 01:42:21.002 align:middle
the record industry was
a ball of confusion.

01:42:21.002 --> 01:42:26.340 align:middle
We had Napster, we had
LimeWire, we had BitTorrent.

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.745 align:middle
This giant invader from
the north, technology.

01:42:30.745 --> 01:42:34.448 align:middle
I'm looking at my guys saying,
well, what do we do with this?

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:37.718 align:middle
So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue,

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:42.957 align:middle
and they showed me something
brilliant and groundbreaking,

01:42:42.957 --> 01:42:49.764 align:middle
a simple, elegant way to
buy music online, iTunes.

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:54.201 align:middle
I'm like, wow, the ads are real.

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:57.405 align:middle
These guys really
do think different.

01:42:57.405 --> 01:43:04.111 align:middle
[Laughter] So they could help
move culture the same way

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:06.714 align:middle
that art moves culture.

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:13.954 align:middle
Technology and art can work
together, at least at Apple.

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:20.728 align:middle
So now 2015, music industry
is a fragmented mess.

01:43:20.728 --> 01:43:24.465 align:middle
If you want to stream
music, you can go over here.

01:43:24.465 --> 01:43:28.202 align:middle
If you want to stream
some video,

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:30.738 align:middle
you can check some
of these places out.

01:43:30.738 --> 01:43:32.706 align:middle
If you want to follow
some artist,

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:37.111 align:middle
there's more confusion for that.

01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:42.116 align:middle
So I reached out to Tim Cook
and Eddy Cue, and I said guys,

01:43:42.116 --> 01:43:48.456 align:middle
can we build a bigger and better
ecosystem with the elegance

01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:52.760 align:middle
and simplicity that
only Apple can do?

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.698 align:middle
One complete thought
around music.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:44:01.302 align:middle
And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:43:57.698 --> 01:44:01.302 align:middle
And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud

01:44:01.302 --> 01:44:05.039 align:middle
of everyone that's worked
so hard, and I am going

01:44:05.039 --> 01:44:08.542 align:middle
to introduce you to Apple Music.

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:13.080 align:middle
[Applause]

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.182 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Music has such
power in our lives.

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:16.884 align:middle
The way we listen to

01:44:16.884 --> 01:44:21.455 align:middle
and experience music is
undergoing a profound change

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.656 align:middle
these days.

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.058 align:middle
To have access to nearly
all the music in the world

01:44:24.058 --> 01:44:27.094 align:middle
at our fingertips and in
our pockets is remarkable.

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:29.830 align:middle
And yet there needs
to be a place

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.999 align:middle
where music can be treated
less like digital bits

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:34.101 align:middle
and more like the art it is,

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:37.872 align:middle
with a sense of respect
and discovery.

01:44:37.872 --> 01:44:39.607 align:middle
And if that place could
actually accommodate

01:44:39.607 --> 01:44:41.642 align:middle
and support the artists
who make the music,

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:43.177 align:middle
not just the top-tier artists,

01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:46.614 align:middle
but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all

01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:49.683 align:middle
with a home and a way to
engage with their audiences,

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:52.119 align:middle
that would be pretty great.

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:54.588 align:middle
And that's what we set out
to do with Apple Music.

01:44:54.588 --> 01:45:00.361 align:middle
[Music]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[Music]

01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:03.397 align:middle
&gt;&gt; On Apple Music, all the
ways you love music can now

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:05.299 align:middle
live together.

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:08.035 align:middle
Stream from the millions
of songs on iTunes any time

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:11.071 align:middle
and on demand, along with
hand-picked playlists,

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:13.407 align:middle
recommendations,
and all that's great

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.177 align:middle
and breaking in music right now.

01:45:16.177 --> 01:45:20.781 align:middle
And broadcasting every day is
Apple's first 24/7 worldwide

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:24.885 align:middle
radio station, live
in over 100 countries,

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:27.655 align:middle
Beats 1 is anchored
by Zane Lowe in LA.

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:29.924 align:middle
Ero Dodden in New York.

01:45:29.924 --> 01:45:32.359 align:middle
&gt;&gt; New York City
worldwide, this is Beats 1.

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:34.161 align:middle
&gt;&gt; And me, Julie out of
London.

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:38.365 align:middle
&gt;&gt; We cannot wait to play you
guys music we've got lined up.

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:42.436 align:middle
&gt;&gt; And at the heart of Apple
Music, there's Connect,

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:45.739 align:middle
where artists can share
with fans like never before.

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:48.809 align:middle
Songs, remixes, demos,
mix tapes, photos,

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:52.012 align:middle
videos, lyrics, soundbites.

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:56.183 align:middle
Really, any way an artist
chooses to express themselves.

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:58.886 align:middle
&gt;&gt; TRENT REZNOR:
For fans,

01:45:58.886 --> 01:46:00.721 align:middle
we tried to create a
complete experience,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:45:58.886 --> 01:46:00.721 align:middle
we tried to create a
complete experience,

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.457 align:middle
by combining the catalog
of the world's music

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:05.459 align:middle
with the music that's
not in that catalog yet,

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.661 align:middle
direct from the artist to you

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.196 align:middle
in a shared experience
with Beats 1.

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:12.933 align:middle
For the artists, we've built
an ecosystem we hope can start

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:16.737 align:middle
to provide the tools to grow,
nurture, and sustain careers.

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:21.675 align:middle
One place, one complete
thought around music.

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:26.180 align:middle
[Music]

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.214 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:29.316 align:middle
&gt;&gt; JIMMY IOVINE:
Thank you.

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:35.489 align:middle
That's Apple Music and
the great Trent Reznor.

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:38.425 align:middle
It's all the ways you love
music all in one place.

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:42.096 align:middle
And that place is
almost in a billion hands

01:46:42.096 --> 01:46:43.797 align:middle
around the world already.

01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:49.803 align:middle
One app, one single
app on your iPhone.

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:52.406 align:middle
Apple Music is three things.

01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:57.411 align:middle
It's a revolutionary
music service.

01:46:57.411 --> 01:47:02.049 align:middle
Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:46:57.411 --> 01:47:02.049 align:middle
Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated

01:47:02.049 --> 01:47:06.687 align:middle
by the leading music experts
who we helped hand-pick.

01:47:06.687 --> 01:47:08.555 align:middle
These people are
going to help you

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:10.891 align:middle
with the most difficult
question in music.

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:15.129 align:middle
When you are listening to a
playlist, what song comes next?

01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:17.731 align:middle
The only song that's
as important

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:19.466 align:middle
as the one you are
listening to at

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:22.503 align:middle
that moment is the
one that follows it.

01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:23.971 align:middle
Now, picture this.

01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:29.376 align:middle
You are in a special moment.

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:33.814 align:middle
You're exercising or some
other special moment.

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:34.982 align:middle
[Laughter] Right, Dre?

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:38.152 align:middle
He exercises a lot.

01:47:38.152 --> 01:47:40.754 align:middle
And your heart's pumping.

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:42.923 align:middle
And you are about
to turn up the reps.

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:46.794 align:middle
And the next song
comes on, ehhh!

01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:48.028 align:middle
Buzz kill.

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:50.964 align:middle
You may ask why that happened.

01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:53.801 align:middle
It happened because it
was probably programmed

01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:56.170 align:middle
by an algorithm alone.

01:47:56.170 --> 01:48:00.274 align:middle
Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:47:56.170 --> 01:48:00.274 align:middle
Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task.

01:48:00.274 --> 01:48:03.243 align:middle
You need a human touch, and
that's why at Apple Music,

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:06.046 align:middle
we want to give you the right
song, the right playlist,

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:09.316 align:middle
at the right moment,
all on demand.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:16.924 align:middle
Now, the first-ever live
24-hour worldwide radio station,

01:48:16.924 --> 01:48:20.461 align:middle
so Trent Reznor calls
me up and says I got it.

01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:22.429 align:middle
This is what we're going to do.

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:27.735 align:middle
Let's build the first-ever
worldwide live radio station

01:48:27.735 --> 01:48:32.206 align:middle
broadcast from three cities
that plays music not based

01:48:32.206 --> 01:48:39.346 align:middle
on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats,

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:45.386 align:middle
only music that is
great and feels great.

01:48:45.386 --> 01:48:50.691 align:middle
A station that has only
one master, music itself.

01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:54.728 align:middle
So I said why do artists
always have the greatest ideas

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:58.866 align:middle
that are practically
impossible to execute?

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:01.668 align:middle
So I said, well, wait a second.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:01.668 align:middle
So I said, well, wait a second.

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.470 align:middle
That's why we are at Apple.

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:07.141 align:middle
We are at Apple to help
artists' dreams be realized.

01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:13.914 align:middle
So we built the station, and
it's a music lover's dream.

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:17.851 align:start
If you love great music without
any restrictions, you are going

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:21.922 align:middle
to love Apple Music's Beats 1.

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:26.293 align:middle
Finally, Connect, a fantastic
way for established and new

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:29.630 align:middle
and even unsigned artists
to connect directly

01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:32.599 align:middle
with music lovers anywhere.

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:35.803 align:middle
This is going to be very
powerful for musicians.

01:49:35.803 --> 01:49:38.439 align:middle
Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist

01:49:38.439 --> 01:49:41.775 align:middle
and being able to
share your music

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:44.244 align:middle
on the biggest music
platform on the world

01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:48.816 align:middle
that people already
have, Apple Music?

01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:51.685 align:middle
Remember, this is an ecosystem.

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:53.921 align:middle
It's built to fit together.

01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:56.223 align:middle
It feeds off each other.

01:49:56.223 --> 01:49:57.791 align:middle
When you upload your music

01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:02.563 align:middle
to Apple Music, anything
can happen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:02.563 align:middle
to Apple Music, anything
can happen.

01:50:02.563 --> 01:50:05.966 align:middle
So now let me leave
the real heavy lifting

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:08.335 align:middle
to my great friend, Eddy Cue,

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:10.904 align:middle
and tell you how this
all works together.

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:18.545 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:20.214 align:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Jimmy.

01:50:20.214 --> 01:50:22.616 align:middle
It's great to be here
this morning with you.

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:25.953 align:middle
So Apple Music, it's a
revolutionary music service,

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:28.455 align:middle
and it starts with My Music.

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.791 align:middle
We've added some great new
features from iTunes like the

01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:35.362 align:middle
Up Next queue, and also
your recently added albums

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:36.964 align:middle
and songs right across the top.

01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:39.333 align:middle
And all of the music
you've purchased,

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:41.969 align:middle
along with the playlists
you've created on your Mac

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:44.872 align:middle
or your iPhone, are right here.

01:50:44.872 --> 01:50:47.574 align:middle
Now, of course, you can
search your music library,

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:50.978 align:middle
but now you can search and
stream the millions and millions

01:50:50.978 --> 01:50:54.748 align:middle
of songs that we have on iTunes.

01:50:54.748 --> 01:50:58.685 align:middle
Now, in addition to My Music,
when you can stream and listen

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:02.389 align:middle
to any song you want, you
need a great place to start,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:02.389 align:middle
to any song you want, you
need a great place to start,

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:05.692 align:middle
and that's why we've
created For You.

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:08.295 align:middle
For You recommends
playlists and albums

01:51:08.295 --> 01:51:10.497 align:middle
that we think you
are going to love.

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:12.499 align:middle
They are personalized
to your taste based

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:15.402 align:middle
on the music you listen
to, the artists you love.

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:19.806 align:middle
And it isn't just algorithms.

01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:23.610 align:middle
It's recommendations made by
real people who love music,

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.446 align:middle
and they are our
team of experts.

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:28.048 align:middle
Now, let's take a look at New.

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:31.518 align:middle
Here you will discover new
artists and albums every week,

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:35.122 align:middle
along with the top charts, and
every one of our playlists,

01:51:35.122 --> 01:51:41.061 align:middle
all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity.

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:43.797 align:middle
So when you think
of Apple Music,

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:48.201 align:middle
it's My Music, For You and New.

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:50.003 align:middle
It makes it fun and easy

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:53.707 align:middle
to experience the catalog
of the world's music.

01:51:53.707 --> 01:51:56.677 align:middle
And that is the revolutionary
music service.

01:51:56.677 --> 01:51:58.879 align:middle
Now let's talk about Radio.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:02.583 align:middle
The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:02.583 align:middle
The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio.

01:52:02.583 --> 01:52:04.217 align:middle
It's just a playlist of songs.

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:07.554 align:middle
And so we wanted to do
something really big.

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:11.525 align:start
We wanted to create a worldwide
live radio station broadcasting

01:52:11.525 --> 01:52:15.729 align:middle
around the globe, and we've
done that with Beats 1.

01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:18.732 align:middle
It's the world's best radio
station now meets the world's

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:22.970 align:middle
best voice, and that's
why we've hired Zane Lowe.

01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:27.174 align:start
Zane is a masterful interviewer
and an influential music figure

01:52:27.174 --> 01:52:31.745 align:middle
in his own right, and to tell
you more about it, here is Zane.

01:52:31.745 --> 01:52:36.183 align:middle
&gt;&gt; ZANE LOWE: I am a
music fan.

01:52:36.183 --> 01:52:38.018 align:middle
I play records.

01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:40.554 align:middle
What I love is watching
a group of people react

01:52:40.554 --> 01:52:43.523 align:middle
to a great record
for the first time.

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:46.460 align:middle
When I play that record on the
radio, the audience tell me,

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:47.961 align:middle
the time lines light up,

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:50.597 align:middle
my friends tell me,
my phone lights up.

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:53.100 align:middle
They love it or they hate it.

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:54.968 align:middle
But it creates a debate.

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:58.105 align:middle
That's what good music
on the radio does.

01:52:58.105 --> 01:53:00.807 align:middle
When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:52:58.105 --> 01:53:00.807 align:middle
When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us

01:53:00.807 --> 01:53:04.811 align:start
to put the great music in front
of the average, the unexpected,

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:08.815 align:middle
the undiscovered, the
anticipated, the underrated.

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:10.951 align:middle
Their words: Move the needle.

01:53:10.951 --> 01:53:13.253 align:middle
And that's what we are doing.

01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:16.156 align:middle
We have real music fans
running this place.

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:19.660 align:middle
We have great music DJs and
incredible artists who are

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.896 align:middle
in the studio right now
building real radio shows

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:24.598 align:middle
that are going to
blow your mind.

01:53:24.598 --> 01:53:28.402 align:middle
And the only place that can
pull off an imaginative idea

01:53:28.402 --> 01:53:30.537 align:middle
as big as this -- Apple.

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:32.572 align:middle
We are called Beats 1.

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:38.245 align:middle
We are always on, playing
the music that we love.

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:42.382 align:middle
[Applause]

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:44.184 align:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: So
Beats 1.

01:53:44.184 --> 01:53:48.021 align:middle
It is worldwide, it is live,
it is broadcasting 24 by 7,

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:50.090 align:middle
and it is coming
from New York, LA,

01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:54.027 align:middle
and London, and that is Radio.

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:57.330 align:middle
Next, we wanted to find a
way to bring fans closer

01:53:57.330 --> 01:54:00.100 align:middle
to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:53:57.330 --> 01:54:00.100 align:middle
to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:05.639 align:middle
It's a place where artists are
free to upload their music,

01:54:05.639 --> 01:54:11.111 align:middle
their videos, their photos,
all directly to a fan.

01:54:11.111 --> 01:54:15.248 align:start
Let's take Pharrell, a favorite
musician and songwriter of mine.

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:18.819 align:middle
He is prolific, and
he does a lot.

01:54:18.819 --> 01:54:21.088 align:middle
Let me show you how
it works with Connect.

01:54:21.088 --> 01:54:23.156 align:middle
He takes a lot of photos.

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:25.325 align:middle
He writes a lot of lyrics.

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:28.495 align:middle
He's experimenting and
mixing songs all the time.

01:54:28.495 --> 01:54:32.132 align:middle
Or he just has something
new and interesting to say.

01:54:32.132 --> 01:54:35.602 align:middle
All of this lives
right in Connect.

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:39.940 align:middle
Artists can post and
publish and upload anything,

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:43.410 align:start
including directly to Facebook,
Twitter, and their own website,

01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:48.415 align:middle
and fans can like and
comment on those posts.

01:54:48.415 --> 01:54:51.451 align:middle
And it's not just for one
artist, but it's for all

01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:53.453 align:middle
of the artists that you love.

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:55.422 align:middle
And to give you a
little sense of what it's

01:54:55.422 --> 01:54:58.525 align:middle
like to be an artist on Connect,

01:54:58.525 --> 01:55:02.195 align:middle
I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:54:58.525 --> 01:55:02.195 align:middle
I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake.

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:11.271 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.612 align:middle
&gt;&gt; DRAKE:
Thank you.

01:55:18.612 --> 01:55:25.018 align:middle
I want to say, honestly, what an
honor it is to be in this room

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:27.454 align:middle
with so many individuals
that have changed the way

01:55:27.454 --> 01:55:29.122 align:middle
in which the world
relates to technology,

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:31.224 align:middle
so give yourselves a
round of applause, please.

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:35.762 align:middle
[Applause]

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:41.168 align:middle
For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket

01:55:41.168 --> 01:55:44.905 align:middle
using a tool known in the
rap world as the Internet.

01:55:44.905 --> 01:55:47.507 align:middle
It's going to be huge this year.

01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:48.842 align:middle
It's out of this world.

01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:50.977 align:middle
He is excited, he knows about
it, that guy right there.

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:53.980 align:middle
[Laughter] Honestly, in all
seriousness, I came here today

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:58.084 align:middle
to share my story, about the
way technology changed what I do

01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:58.852 align:middle
for a living.

01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:02.255 align:middle
I am from Toronto, Canada.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:02.255 align:middle
I am from Toronto, Canada.

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:06.760 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.095 align:middle
[Laughter]

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:12.499 align:middle
You know, as a kid growing up,
I always wondered if my city

01:56:12.499 --> 01:56:16.403 align:middle
or even my country would
have somebody break

01:56:16.403 --> 01:56:19.339 align:middle
into the global music
scene as a true superstar.

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:23.743 align:middle
You know, the dream seemed
unattainable at the time.

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.546 align:middle
Even myself, I tried to
do it the traditional way,

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:31.484 align:middle
the towering New York label
buildings, the lobby littered

01:56:31.484 --> 01:56:34.888 align:middle
with other people's
accomplishments.

01:56:34.888 --> 01:56:37.724 align:middle
It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going

01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:40.460 align:middle
to get a shot to have
their vision validated.

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:44.998 align:middle
And then that's when
the game changed.

01:56:44.998 --> 01:56:47.601 align:middle
And we had to change it.

01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:52.539 align:middle
Myself and my team
brought our vision

01:56:52.539 --> 01:56:54.941 align:middle
and our music directly
to the people.

01:56:54.941 --> 01:57:02.849 align:middle
And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:56:54.941 --> 01:57:02.849 align:middle
And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed.

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:08.588 align:middle
The dream of being a new artist
like myself five years ago

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:11.491 align:middle
and connecting directly with
an audience has never been more

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:14.461 align:middle
close and reachable
than right now.

01:57:14.461 --> 01:57:19.866 align:middle
See, now we encourage you to
spend the time on your body

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:24.437 align:middle
of work, spend the time on your
craft, assemble the right body

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:26.806 align:middle
of work, and instead of
having to post your stuff

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:31.044 align:middle
on all these different and
sometimes confusing places,

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:33.446 align:middle
it all lives in one very simple,

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:37.651 align:middle
very easy place,
and that is Connect.

01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:40.220 align:middle
It's right from where
you are in your city

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.355 align:middle
in front of your computer.

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:45.225 align:middle
And this approach is
how we broke in 2008,

01:57:45.225 --> 01:57:48.395 align:middle
and it has been perfected
and simplified, of course,

01:57:48.395 --> 01:57:51.298 align:middle
by the great people at Apple.

01:57:51.298 --> 01:57:57.470 align:middle
So you know, as I'm working
tirelessly on this next album,

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:59.539 align:middle
this comes at the
perfect time for me.

01:57:59.539 --> 01:58:05.378 align:middle
Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:57:59.539 --> 01:58:05.378 align:middle
Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:07.447 align:middle
to iTunes, this really --

01:58:07.447 --> 01:58:14.120 align:middle
I can't wait to incorporate
Apple Music

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:16.022 align:middle
and especially Connect
into what I am doing next.

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:17.791 align:middle
I am really excited about
what I am working on.

01:58:17.791 --> 01:58:21.661 align:start
And as an artist, I can say for
all those kids sitting at home,

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:26.199 align:middle
it's truly amazing to be part
of something that I believe in,

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:31.671 align:middle
and this is something
that simplifies everything

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:34.307 align:middle
for the modern musician
like myself

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:37.310 align:middle
and the modern music
consumer like you.

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:39.045 align:middle
So I hope you enjoy Apple Music.

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.180 align:middle
I hope you enjoy Connect.

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.948 align:middle
My name is Drake, and
thank you for your time.

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.416 align:middle
Appreciate it.

01:58:43.416 --> 01:58:50.523 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:53.259 align:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Drake.

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:54.928 align:middle
And that is Connect.

01:58:54.928 --> 01:58:58.565 align:middle
Now, I'd love to give you
a demo of Apple Music,

01:58:58.565 --> 01:59:00.767 align:middle
but before I start, I do want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:58:58.565 --> 01:59:00.767 align:middle
but before I start, I do want

01:59:00.767 --> 01:59:04.437 align:middle
to wish Phil Schiller
a happy birthday.

01:59:04.437 --> 01:59:13.513 align:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:59:16.483 --> 01:59:20.453 align:middle
So let's go ahead and
launch our new Music app.

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:22.689 align:middle
You will notice right away
it's got a brand-new UI,

01:59:22.689 --> 01:59:24.124 align:middle
much simpler to use.

01:59:24.124 --> 01:59:26.760 align:middle
Your recently added albums and
songs right across the top.

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.463 align:middle
Let's play this new
song from Spoon I added.

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:34.134 align:middle
[Music]

01:59:34.134 --> 01:59:35.201 align:middle
One of the things
you will notice,

01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:37.003 align:middle
we have a new mini
player across the bottom

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:39.005 align:middle
that always shows
you what's playing.

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:41.941 align:middle
If I tap on it, I
get full screen,

01:59:41.941 --> 01:59:44.010 align:middle
and I can see the
beautiful artwork,

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.445 align:middle
all the playback controls.

01:59:45.445 --> 01:59:51.618 align:middle
I can just swipe down,
and it disappears.

01:59:52.986 --> 01:59:55.588 align:middle
Now, I like looking
at my music by artist.

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:56.723 align:middle
It's really easy to do that too.

01:59:56.723 --> 02:00:00.693 align:middle
I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:59:56.723 --> 02:00:00.693 align:middle
I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists,

02:00:00.693 --> 02:00:02.295 align:middle
and let's take a look
at Aretha Franklin.

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:05.331 align:middle
The first thing you will notice
is we add beautiful artwork

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:07.333 align:middle
to all the artist pages.

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:09.602 align:middle
Notice as I swipe
up, it goes away,

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:11.204 align:middle
and you see Aretha at the top.

02:00:11.204 --> 02:00:15.442 align:middle
No demo goes complete
without playing this song.

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:25.585 align:middle
[Music]

02:00:27.287 --> 02:00:30.623 align:middle
Now, you not only get all of
your Aretha Franklin songs

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:33.560 align:middle
in your music library, but
you can also tap on All,

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.362 align:middle
and now you can see all of
the songs on Apple Music,

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:39.799 align:middle
including the latest
release, what the top song is,

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.769 align:middle
what the top album is.

02:00:42.769 --> 02:00:45.171 align:middle
Now, it is hard to stop this
song, but I want to keep going.

02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:48.274 align:middle
Now let's go back to my library,

02:00:48.274 --> 02:00:50.910 align:middle
and let's take a
look at my playlists.

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.912 align:middle
Now, despite the game last
night, I am getting ready

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.881 align:middle
for tomorrow night, and I
have already started creating

02:00:54.881 --> 02:00:56.282 align:middle
my playlist.

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:58.051 align:middle
One of the first things you will
notice is you can add your own

02:00:58.051 --> 02:00:59.419 align:middle
artwork to your playlist.

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:01.521 align:middle
I am going to be
doing this tonight,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:01.521 align:middle
I am going to be
doing this tonight,

02:01:01.521 --> 02:01:04.824 align:middle
getting the Warriors
ready, but let's go back.

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:09.996 align:middle
It is karaoke night, and
these are some of the songs

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:12.599 align:middle
that our team has to
look forward to tonight.

02:01:12.599 --> 02:01:14.134 align:middle
Let's go ahead and play that.

02:01:14.134 --> 02:01:16.202 align:middle
[Music]

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.570 align:middle
Just imagine.

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:22.075 align:middle
[Music]

02:01:22.075 --> 02:01:25.111 align:middle
Now, if I tap on
the mini player,

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:27.180 align:middle
I can see the full screen.

02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:30.116 align:middle
If I tap on the right-hand side
next to the playback controls,

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:32.385 align:middle
I can see the complete
playlist, and it's very easy

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:33.486 align:middle
for me to reorganize it.

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:35.955 align:middle
Let's say I want to
move Jealous back up,

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.857 align:middle
and now that will be the
next song that plays.

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:39.592 align:middle
It's that simple.

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:46.166 align:middle
[Applause]

02:01:46.166 --> 02:01:47.567 align:middle
Now, that's great.

02:01:47.567 --> 02:01:50.069 align:start
The first time we go to For You,
we want to find out a little bit

02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:51.971 align:middle
about your musical
tastes, so we are going

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:53.840 align:middle
to ask you what genres you like.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:01.748 align:middle
I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:01.748 align:middle
I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative.

02:02:01.748 --> 02:02:06.252 align:middle
And now it will ask me for
some artists that I like.

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:08.788 align:middle
Well, I love Bruce Springsteen,
so I am going to tap twice.

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:13.526 align:middle
I like Lorde, like
Alabama Shakes.

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:14.794 align:middle
Now we are going to take all

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:17.397 align:middle
of this information you've
provided, along with all

02:02:17.397 --> 02:02:20.867 align:start
of your playlists and the songs
that you've purchased on iTunes,

02:02:20.867 --> 02:02:23.736 align:middle
and we are going to make
recommendations just for you.

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:27.040 align:middle
So here is one inspired
by Bruce Springsteen.

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.075 align:middle
Here's one called
Bring the Big Rock.

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:30.643 align:middle
Let's play that.

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:34.514 align:middle
[Music]

02:02:34.514 --> 02:02:36.516 align:middle
That's a great Foo
Fighters song.

02:02:36.516 --> 02:02:40.353 align:middle
I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs.

02:02:40.353 --> 02:02:42.488 align:middle
Definitely going to
like this playlist.

02:02:44.357 --> 02:02:46.359 align:middle
Now, here's another
one from Pharrell.

02:02:46.359 --> 02:02:48.995 align:middle
I also get new albums
that are available to me,

02:02:48.995 --> 02:02:51.331 align:middle
and even some classic albums
that I should be listening to.

02:02:51.331 --> 02:02:54.801 align:middle
And so here are some
brand-new albums

02:02:54.801 --> 02:02:56.936 align:middle
from the artists
that I really love.

02:02:56.936 --> 02:03:02.709 align:middle
Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:02:56.936 --> 02:03:02.709 align:middle
Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist.

02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:04.177 align:middle
You might be wondering
how did that get in there?

02:03:04.177 --> 02:03:08.715 align:middle
Well, I like a lot of Latin
music, so Apple Music knows that

02:03:08.715 --> 02:03:10.183 align:middle
and is recommending
this playlist to me.

02:03:10.183 --> 02:03:12.752 align:middle
Let's take a look at it.

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:20.560 align:middle
[Music]

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.695 align:middle
Definitely gets my
Cuban blood going.

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:27.734 align:middle
[Music]

02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:30.903 align:middle
Now, this is a playlist I
definitely want to keep,

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:33.740 align:middle
so I am going to tap on the
plus sign, and I've added

02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:35.408 align:middle
that now to my playlist.

02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:41.414 align:middle
Now, let's take a
look at what's new.

02:03:41.414 --> 02:03:44.651 align:middle
You can see new albums
across the top.

02:03:44.651 --> 02:03:46.986 align:middle
More here, and even the
hot singles that are out.

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:50.723 align:middle
Let's play this one from
Florence and the Machine.

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:59.799 align:middle
[Music]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:07.573 align:middle
I can keep scrolling and
see some recent releases.

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:10.810 align:middle
But of course, everyone loves
the charts, so let's go ahead

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:15.214 align:middle
and take a look at the
charts, see the top songs.

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:16.149 align:middle
The top albums.

02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:18.384 align:middle
And even the top music videos.

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:22.488 align:middle
We have tens of thousands of
music videos in HD, all ad-free.

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:25.358 align:middle
Let's take a look at this
one from Mark Ronson.

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:36.836 align:middle
[Music]

02:04:57.490 --> 02:05:00.293 align:middle
I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:04:57.490 --> 02:05:00.293 align:middle
I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year.

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:03.129 align:middle
[Laughter] Now, sometimes
you just want to sit back

02:05:03.129 --> 02:05:06.632 align:middle
and let someone else be your
DJ, so let's go to Radio.

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:08.234 align:middle
And to give you a little taste

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:11.003 align:middle
of what Beats 1 is
going to sound like ...

02:05:14.741 --> 02:05:15.508 align:middle
&gt;&gt;
Beats 1.

02:05:15.508 --> 02:05:16.776 align:middle
Welcome our special guest,

02:05:16.776 --> 02:05:18.344 align:middle
Florence from Florence
and the Machine.

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:21.948 align:middle
&gt;&gt; On paper, it sounds like
super, not how you think a rock

02:05:21.948 --> 02:05:23.716 align:middle
and roll album would be made.

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:25.251 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Was that you in
your sweatpants?

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:29.389 align:middle
&gt;&gt; That was me in an anorak
cycling to the studio.

02:05:29.389 --> 02:05:31.724 align:middle
&gt;&gt; We are looking for the
most exciting music and people

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:33.960 align:middle
that love it in all
corners of the globe,

02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.962 align:middle
broadcasting to 100 countries.

02:05:35.962 --> 02:05:39.265 align:middle
That shared experience
just got so much bigger.

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.134 align:middle
&amp;gt;&amp;gt
LA.

02:05:41.134 --> 02:05:43.069 align:middle
&gt;&gt; New York
City.

02:05:43.069 --> 02:05:44.036 align:middle
&gt;&gt;
London.

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:44.971 align:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: That's
really awesome.

02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:46.205 align:middle
Let's take a look at Connect

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:49.575 align:middle
and see what my favorite
artists are up to.

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:52.712 align:middle
Here's Pharrell and some
behind-the-scenes footage.

02:05:52.712 --> 02:05:53.679 align:middle
Here is Chris Cornell.

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:55.581 align:middle
This is an interesting one.

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:58.518 align:middle
He has posted lyrics of a new
song that's coming out before,

02:05:58.518 --> 02:06:00.686 align:middle
obviously, he's even
recorded it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

obviously, he's even
recorded it.

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:02.488 align:middle
Here's Bastille.

02:06:02.488 --> 02:06:05.358 align:middle
They are working on
their next album.

02:06:05.358 --> 02:06:07.860 align:middle
Let's see what they have to say.

02:06:08.995 --> 02:06:10.963 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Mark is just through
here, and we are working

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:13.800 align:middle
on a song called Blame, which
some of you might have heard

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.536 align:middle
at festivals or gigs before,

02:06:16.536 --> 02:06:19.705 align:middle
but we're really excited to
have finally recorded it.

02:06:19.705 --> 02:06:21.340 align:middle
It's a song about gangsters.

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.575 align:middle
And yeah, this is the riff,

02:06:22.575 --> 02:06:25.878 align:middle
which we already
have sounding great.

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:32.351 align:middle
[Music]

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:34.287 align:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: It's great to be
able to get behind the scenes

02:06:34.287 --> 02:06:37.089 align:middle
and see what the process that
an artist uses to create a song.

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:40.526 align:middle
As we keep going
down, here's a shot

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:43.396 align:middle
from Alabama Shakes
a couple nights ago.

02:06:43.396 --> 02:06:46.766 align:middle
And here is a studio session,
actually, at Capital Studio A.

02:06:46.766 --> 02:06:48.601 align:middle
Those of you who know,
Capitol Studio is one

02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:51.137 align:middle
of the premier studios,
historical,

02:06:51.137 --> 02:06:53.906 align:middle
and Alabama Shakes was just
there a couple nights ago.

&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Again,
be able

02:07:19.332 --> 02:07:22.635 align:middle
to see things you've never
been able to hear or see.

02:07:22.635 --> 02:07:25.838 align:middle
Loren Kramar, you probably
have never heard of him.

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:29.208 align:middle
He is an unsigned artist, I
just started following him.

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:31.844 align:middle
He has posted a new song
right up on Connect,

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.546 align:middle
and I would love to play it now.

02:07:33.546 --> 02:07:36.949 align:middle
First time anyone's heard it.

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:43.489 align:middle
[Music]

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:44.657 align:middle
Just imagine you
are a new artist,

02:07:44.657 --> 02:07:46.659 align:middle
and look at all the
people who have been able

02:07:46.659 --> 02:07:48.961 align:middle
to hear this song right
now thanks to Connect.

So Loren Kramar.

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.345 align:middle
Remember that name.

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:09.215 align:middle
We think he is going to
be really, really huge.

02:08:09.215 --> 02:08:11.918 align:middle
Now, of course, you can always
search for music across all

02:08:11.918 --> 02:08:13.319 align:middle
of our millions and
millions of songs.

02:08:13.319 --> 02:08:15.855 align:middle
I like to do a little
bit of stuff with Siri

02:08:15.855 --> 02:08:19.492 align:middle
because Siri has been learning
a lot more about music.

02:08:19.492 --> 02:08:22.361 align:middle
Play Born to Run.

[Music]

02:08:36.876 --> 02:08:38.578 align:middle
It's one of my favorite
songs of all time.

02:08:38.578 --> 02:08:39.979 align:middle
Let's get a little
more specific.

02:08:39.979 --> 02:08:44.550 align:middle
Play the top ten
songs in Alternative.

02:08:47.019 --> 02:08:56.095 align:middle

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

If I tap on the Up Next
queue, I can see all

02:09:01.434 --> 02:09:04.437 align:middle
of the top ten songs
and what's next.

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:11.644 align:middle
Now, I feel like reminiscing
a little, and let's go back

02:09:11.644 --> 02:09:15.114 align:middle
to my high school
days when I graduated.

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:19.585 align:middle
Play the top song from May 1982.

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:31.130 align:middle
[Music]

02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:41.841 align:middle
Now, that brings back some
memories, but we will leave

02:09:41.841 --> 02:09:43.209 align:middle
that for another time.

02:09:43.209 --> 02:09:47.580 align:middle
Have you ever gone to a movie
and you love the soundtrack

02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:50.583 align:middle
or the song that was on there,
but you don't know the name

02:09:50.583 --> 02:09:52.018 align:middle
or you have forgotten
about it later?

02:09:52.018 --> 02:09:55.321 align:middle
Well, it's really
easy with Siri.

02:09:55.321 --> 02:09:58.090 align:middle
Play the song from Selma.

Play the song from Selma.

02:10:39.999 --> 02:10:42.635 align:middle

an exciting way for fans

02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:56.949 align:middle
the best place to buy music.

a new version of

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:28.280 align:middle
We want everyone to try it,

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:31.183 align:middle
so we are making the
first three months free.

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:37.623 align:middle
[Applause]

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:40.559 align:middle
Now, we want to do something
really great for families.

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:42.795 align:middle
Today you have to buy
a music subscription

02:11:42.795 --> 02:11:44.997 align:middle
for each and every person.

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:47.600 align:middle
Or you share an account even
though you are not supposed to.

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.103 align:middle
And now all of you can't
play at the same time,

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:52.138 align:middle
and your playlists

02:11:52.138 --> 02:11:54.507 align:middle
and recommendations
get all messed up.

02:11:54.507 --> 02:11:59.445 align:middle
Well, with Apple Music, for
just $14.99, you can have

02:11:59.445 --> 02:12:01.213 align:middle
up to six family members.

Everyone gets their own

their own recommendations.

02:12:13.192 --> 02:12:15.728 align:middle
It's an incredible value.

02:12:15.728 --> 02:12:17.396 align:middle
And that is Apple Music.

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.063 align:middle
Thank you.

Thanks, Eddy.

Isn't that amazing?

02:12:28.908 --> 02:12:32.645 align:middle
We really love Apple Music,
and we hope that you do too.

02:12:32.645 --> 02:12:34.146 align:middle
And we are so excited about it,

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:37.216 align:middle
and with all the countries
we are rolling out to,

02:12:37.216 --> 02:12:40.753 align:middle
we made a great ad to
tell the world about it.

02:12:40.753 --> 02:12:43.222 align:middle
And I'd love to run
it for you now.

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.894 align:middle

Beats 1.

02:12:48.894 --> 02:12:50.996 align:middle

I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as we have.

02:14:10.276 --> 02:14:12.044 align:middle
We want to thank
everybody for joining us,

02:14:12.044 --> 02:14:17.349 align:middle
especially the developers,
and I'd like to recognize all

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:21.654 align:middle
of the people in Apple, all
of our team that have worked

02:14:21.654 --> 02:14:24.957 align:middle
so hard on making
and creating all

02:14:24.957 --> 02:14:26.725 align:middle

you've seen this morning.

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:28.360 align:middle
Thank you, guys.

02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:40.139 align:middle
It is an incredible privilege
of a lifetime to work with them.

02:14:40.139 --> 02:14:43.442 align:middle
Now, I've got one last thing.

02:14:43.442 --> 02:14:48.547 align:middle
Before we go, it's only
fitting to celebrate the launch

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:54.386 align:middle
of Apple Music with an
incredible music performance

02:14:54.386 --> 02:14:57.923 align:middle

artists in music today,

02:14:57.923 --> 02:15:03.028 align:middle
