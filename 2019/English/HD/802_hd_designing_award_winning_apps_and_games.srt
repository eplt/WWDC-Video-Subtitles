00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:12,576
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:13,676
>> Hey, everyone.


4
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:14,886
My name is Lauren.


5
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:15,606
>> And I'm Doug.


6
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:16,996
>> And we're on the Design


7
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,076
Evangelism Team.


8
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:20,566
On Monday night, we hosted the


9
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,506
Apple Design Awards and we


10
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:23,856
honored some of the best apps


11
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,656
and games that we saw this year.


12
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:27,506
>> Each year we're really


13
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:28,946
inspired by the work the


14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,396
developer community does on our


15
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,176
platforms.


16
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:33,466
And we're excited to show you


17
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,676
the apps and games tonight.


18
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:38,686
So we almost called this


19
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,856
session, How to Win an Apple


20
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,606
Design Award, because we get


21
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:43,676
asked about it a lot.


22
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:45,316
>> Yeah, and we totally


23
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:46,796
understand why people would ask


24
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,836
this question, right?


25
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:51,316
>> Totally makes sense to wonder


26
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,936
what goes into the selection of


27
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,556
just a few apps and games.


28
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,746
>> So are there any criteria


29
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,316
behind the apps and games that


30
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,236
we selected?


31
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,656
>> Sure. Are we going to talk


32
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,096
about those criteria today?


33
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,916
>> Well, we're actually going to


34
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,936
talk about something that is


35
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,826
much more compelling and useful


36
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:10,216
to you.


37
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,156
>> So we're going to talk about


38
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,436
the values that are behind these


39
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:16,236
apps and games.


40
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:18,976
>> Each app and game really


41
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:20,936
delivers elements of all of


42
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:21,366
these.


43
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:23,316
But we're going to take you on a


44
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,716
journey behind the scenes of the


45
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,186
award-winning apps and games.


46
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,896
>> And we're going to tell you


47
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:31,886
short stories about the design


48
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,036
processes and methods that went


49
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:34,896
into each one.


50
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,486
In each story we're going to


51
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,406
tease out some lessons.


52
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,616
>> So let's dive right in.


53
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:44,206
>> Innovation.


54
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:44,926
>> Innovation.


55
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:47,826
>> It's sort of an obvious place


56
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,566
to start maybe, but there were


57
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,286
some really innovative apps and


58
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:52,366
games this year.


59
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:54,636
So each of these apps that we're


60
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:55,926
going to talk about brings out a


61
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:56,956
different dimension of


62
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:57,596
innovation.


63
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,646
>> All right, so let's start


64
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,516
with Asphalt 9.


65
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,536
Asphalt 9 is a racing game with


66
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,496
an innovative new control scheme


67
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,705
and to best explain it, I just


68
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:09,765
think we should check it out.


69
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,976
Three, two, one.


70
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,696
In Asphalt 9, you focus on item


71
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,366
and path selection with swipes,


72
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,286
just like this.


73
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:28,156
And you tap and hold that gives


74
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,836
you nitro and boost action.


75
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,096
Now drifts and nitro are the


76
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:34,186
main actions of acceleration and


77
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,006
braking in this game.


78
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:37,146
Now this is not a


79
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,166
driving-assisted.


80
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,046
It's an entirely new way to


81
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:40,366
play.


82
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,296
And this new control scheme is


83
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,666
called TouchDrive.


84
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,426
But what makes TouchDrive so


85
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:48,976
innovative?


86
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,856
Because it subverts our


87
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,566
expectations of racing game


88
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,066
controls.


89
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,436
To do this, the developer


90
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,556
questioned basic assumptions


91
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,436
that we all have taken for


92
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:00,926
granted.


93
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,276
They questioned the assumption


94
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,016
that driving controls required


95
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:07,476
acceleration, braking and


96
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:07,786
turning.


97
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,126
So they started completely from


98
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:10,626
scratch.


99
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,896
This led to an exciting idea.


100
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,526
After being challenged to figure


101
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,026
out a simplified and more


102
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,546
accessible control scheme for


103
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,706
iOS, the developer tried this


104
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,856
crazy idea that moves the main


105
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,886
controls away from acceleration


106
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,376
and braking to nitro and drift


107
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:28,856
actions.


108
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,326
They quickly realized there was


109
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,716
something special there because


110
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:34,376
it helped players get into the


111
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:36,446
fun so much faster.


112
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:38,566
But they were not done shaking


113
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,116
things up yet.


114
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:42,206
Asphalt 9 knew that traditional


115
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,486
turning as a player control was


116
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,236
very prone to player error.


117
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,086
So after rounds of testing and


118
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,076
feedback, they replaced


119
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:53,966
traditional path -- excuse me,


120
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,146
they replaced turning with path


121
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,226
and item selection through swipe


122
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:58,716
gestures.


123
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,246
And this made people less


124
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,306
frustrated, because it helped


125
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,556
people focus on learning the


126
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,536
very elaborate tracks and play


127
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:07,476
more strategically.


128
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,756
So TouchDrive has now become the


129
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,386
default control scheme for


130
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,646
strategic racing, fine-tuning


131
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:15,826
and level recon.


132
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,106
Now full manual controls are a


133
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,596
matter of surgical precision and


134
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,776
are still available.


135
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,506
But what I love is that this


136
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,526
developer took an informed risk.


137
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,466
After iterating, testing and


138
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,496
getting feedback, the design


139
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,336
decision to diverge from


140
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:34,716
traditional driving controls has


141
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:36,506
allowed for an entirely new


142
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:37,966
experience to emerge.


143
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,596
And the innovation of TouchDrive


144
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,856
has revealed an entirely new way


145
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:43,846
to play the game.


146
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,786
So during your app design or


147
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:51,886
game design process, question


148
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,226
assumptions from the start.


149
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,166
Ask questions.


150
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,346
Ask, "Why are we doing it this


151
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:57,676
way?"


152
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,636
Is it because we've just always


153
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:00,456
done it this way?


154
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:03,456
And convert problems into ideas,


155
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,466
just like the problem of


156
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,886
error-prone turning led to new


157
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,606
path selection in Asphalt 9.


158
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,206
Because when you do, you can


159
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,566
create something that has never


160
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:15,756
been done before.


161
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:18,576
This game is so much fun.


162
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,626
And that is truly innovative.


163
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,146
>> Okay. Let's stay on the theme


164
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,816
of crazy car stunts.


165
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,546
No, actually, let's stay on the


166
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,866
theme of simplification, making


167
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,636
things easier.


168
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,116
>> What could be simpler than


169
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:36,176
jumping over the Golden Gate


170
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,166
Bridge with a single swipe?


171
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,676
>> Oh my God, wait till I show


172
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:40,026
you this.


173
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,696
>> All right.


174
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:42,626
>> So I want to talk about


175
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:43,246
HomeCourt.


176
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:45,156
HomeCourt is an app that uses


177
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,946
your iPhone camera and ML models


178
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:49,276
to help you become a better


179
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:50,256
basketball player.


180
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,306
The app works so naturally and


181
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,186
so effortlessly because the


182
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,986
HomeCourt team focused on


183
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:58,646
removing obstacles to getting


184
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,556
started with each of your drills


185
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,296
and workouts.


186
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:02,366
And I want to show you how they


187
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:02,696
did it.


188
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,126
So here's the HomeCourt app.


189
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,656
Like I said, it uses the camera


190
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,426
and machine learning to chart my


191
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,896
shots on a basketball court.


192
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,086
Before this app came along,


193
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,766
people just didn't have access


194
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:16,906
to this information.


195
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:18,856
You really needed someone to


196
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:22,006
manually chart it, each make and


197
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:22,486
miss.


198
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,646
You could also install an entire


199
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:28,116
system in your gym to do it, but


200
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,536
you couldn't really do it as


201
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,786
easily as HomeCourt makes it.


202
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,256
So how do you get this


203
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,446
information just by using your


204
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:36,906
iPhone?


205
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:40,216
When I tried it, it feels like


206
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:40,676
magic.


207
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,426
And I wanted to know how they


208
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:43,016
got there.


209
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,256
So I asked them to tell me where


210
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,386
they started and where this all


211
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:48,086
came from.


212
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:50,336
And the founder actually started


213
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:51,986
out by saying, "When we first


214
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,606
launched, the experience was


215
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:55,546
actually not magical."


216
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:59,486
So to get information from


217
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,196
HomeCourt you had to go through


218
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,406
a series of steps.


219
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,776
The first one was to put your


220
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,066
phone in a tripod.


221
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,176
I don't know how many basketball


222
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,056
players are here, but if you


223
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,286
play basketball, I'm guessing


224
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,236
you don't go to play basketball


225
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:17,476
with a tripod in your gym bag.


226
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,626
So you know, it's clear that


227
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,036
bringing the tripod is an


228
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,076
obstacle, right?


229
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:22,746
It's something you had to


230
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,876
remember to bring and set up.


231
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,436
And that wasn't the only


232
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:27,096
obstacle.


233
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:28,816
You needed equipment and you


234
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,156
needed to do manual work to set


235
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:32,986
up the app.


236
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,156
Two of the requirements early on


237
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,566
related to lighting.


238
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,856
The app worked best when the sun


239
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:43,626
was directly overhead on a super


240
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,266
sunny day.


241
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:47,266
You know, but other than that.


242
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:49,426
So the HomeCourt team went to


243
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,046
work and they tried to automate


244
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:52,946
as much as possible using the


245
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,876
camera and machine learning


246
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:55,356
models.


247
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:57,686
The first thing they did was


248
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,876
find a way to detect the hoop.


249
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:02,726
And then they were able to


250
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,176
detect the three-point line.


251
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:05,886
So this line is in different


252
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,086
places in different kinds of


253
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,446
courts, so this allowed them to


254
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,546
better detect courts in


255
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:12,506
different countries.


256
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:14,806
So more and more people were


257
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,266
able to use it at this point.


258
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,196
And this also allowed them to


259
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:19,816
begin to locate the shot a


260
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,106
little more precisely.


261
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:23,706
So they've removed some of the


262
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:24,586
manual work.


263
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,356
You didn't have to tap on the


264
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,866
screen to identify the hoop


265
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,056
anymore and you didn't have to


266
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,846
draw a rectangle around the


267
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:32,285
lane.


268
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,895
Next, they found a way to detect


269
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:36,576
legs.


270
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,556
This allowed people to use the


271
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,376
app in almost any lighting


272
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:41,066
conditions.


273
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,686
So you could use HomeCourt on a


274
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,646
cloudy day.


275
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,676
Soon after that, they kind of


276
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,546
upgraded to full pose


277
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:50,426
estimation.


278
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,946
So this is detecting all the key


279
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:53,766
body joints, and this helped


280
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,096
them even more accurately map


281
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,676
where the shot originated.


282
00:08:58,756 --> 00:08:59,976
So they're making progress,


283
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:00,266
right?


284
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,446
They're simplifying it, but you


285
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,906
still had to bring the tripod.


286
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,486
Until they created a mode that


287
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,606
allowed you to set the phone on


288
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:08,956
the ground.


289
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,926
So this removed the final


290
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:13,996
obstacles, and I want to show


291
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,326
you how that last part happens.


292
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,606
So now you can start tracking


293
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:21,036
your shots just by propping your


294
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,306
phone up against a water bottle,


295
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,706
walking to the free throw line.


296
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,296
And shooting a free throw.


297
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:30,903
Aw.


298
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:32,743
>> Aw.


299
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,656
>> Never could get one.


300
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,376
[ Laughter ]


301
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,206
So it might not have been


302
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,846
magical at first, but when you


303
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,986
do it now, it feels like magic.


304
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,236
And there's tons of machine


305
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:45,906
learning at work, but you don't


306
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:46,546
see it.


307
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,266
You're not -- it's not right in


308
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:48,996
your face.


309
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,726
It doesn't feel that way.


310
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,596
And with HomeCourt you get


311
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:54,046
access to information you've


312
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,006
never had before.


313
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,326
And the app feels like an


314
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,116
extension of what you already


315
00:09:59,116 --> 00:09:59,486
do.


316
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,246
But it's been taken to another


317
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:01,726
level.


318
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,466
So it fits in the flow of your


319
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,866
shooting practice, but gives you


320
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,266
more.


321
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,586
So the innovation here is


322
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:10,806
probably obvious.


323
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,336
It's a matter of simplifying


324
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:15,066
down to what people want to do,


325
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,596
fitting into the natural flow of


326
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,496
their real life.


327
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,816
And providing value without


328
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:20,726
getting in the way.


329
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,876
>> That's so awesome, Doug.


330
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:25,076
I actually want to go play some


331
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:25,886
basketball later.


332
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,006
>> Let's go do some shooting.


333
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,256
So these apps and games really


334
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,336
pushed the boundaries.


335
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:35,696
>> And the best kind of


336
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:36,956
innovation is the kind that you


337
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:37,976
don't even notice, right?


338
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,096
>> Exactly, when they just make


339
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,896
the experience simple and


340
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:42,226
better.


341
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:44,386
>> And truly, anything that


342
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:45,826
helps a person feel more


343
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:49,446
confident in using it is great.


344
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,766
>> Speaking of confidence, let's


345
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,096
go on to the next one, Trust.


346
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:55,176
And I want to talk about how an


347
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,896
app or a game can establish


348
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,296
trust with the people who use


349
00:10:58,296 --> 00:10:58,476
it.


350
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,216
And I'm going to use Pixelmator


351
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,936
Photo as an example of this.


352
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:03,536
So this is a photo editor


353
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,386
designed specifically for iPad


354
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,196
and it also uses machine


355
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,976
learning, but it's doing it


356
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,086
trained on millions, literally


357
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,166
millions of professional photos


358
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,336
to make photo editing awesome


359
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,036
and easy.


360
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,076
And I want to show you how they


361
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:18,446
do it.


362
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,966
So I want to start by saying


363
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,386
machine learning is popping up


364
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:27,066
everywhere, but user experiences


365
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,556
that are informed by machine


366
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,626
learning can sometimes feel a


367
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,306
bit like black boxes.


368
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,976
You might often wonder, you


369
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,716
might sometimes wonder, maybe


370
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,286
often, "Why am I seeing this


371
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:38,916
content?


372
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,986
What forces are at work?


373
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:43,316
Why is the app showing me this?"


374
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:46,706
And there are also controls that


375
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,706
claim to do magic things, but


376
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,776
these can feel unpredictable and


377
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,346
random.


378
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,516
And so when things are hard to


379
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,626
understand or hard to predict,


380
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,956
it can be hard to trust them.


381
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,846
So I want to show you Pixelmator


382
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,976
Photo and how they handle it.


383
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:07,716
I'm going to take a walk on the


384
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:08,346
beach here.


385
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,916
So on the surface, the UI is


386
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:13,886
pretty conventional.


387
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,306
There are tools in the


388
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,646
navigation bar and there are


389
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:19,326
base photo adjustments in the


390
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,366
inspector and presets along the


391
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:21,826
bottom.


392
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,836
The core of any kind of power


393
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,126
tool is the inspector, and in


394
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,766
Pixelmator Photo this is where


395
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,066
the base adjustments live.


396
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,796
So these will be familiar to


397
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,156
photo geeks and experts, but


398
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:37,186
most people don't really know


399
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:38,746
what any of those do, and they


400
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,816
can frankly be a little


401
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:40,616
intimidating.


402
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:43,906
But the magic of Pixelmator


403
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,306
Photo is a single button, and it


404
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,656
allows you to apply the


405
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,246
expertise of thousands of


406
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,706
professional photographers to


407
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,226
your photo with one button.


408
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:53,976
There, I did it.


409
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,526
You'll see it again.


410
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,496
So when you tap that button,


411
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,116
Pixelmator Photo is actually


412
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,316
adjusting your photo with a


413
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:03,846
model that's been trained on 20


414
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:05,816
million professional photos.


415
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,106
So the work behind the button is


416
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,906
astounding and the results are


417
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:12,816
pretty incredible.


418
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,386
In the UI, they're using a


419
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:17,226
familiar control you might have


420
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,416
seen before, the Magic Wand.


421
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:22,306
And Magic Wands in UIs typically


422
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:25,316
mean don't worry about it, we


423
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:26,226
know what we're doing.


424
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,866
It's going to be awesome.


425
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,126
But from a user point of view,


426
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:31,486
you're not exactly sure what's


427
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:32,866
happening when you tap that


428
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:33,306
button.


429
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,276
So when I ask the developers


430
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:37,756
about this, about their choice


431
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,236
of icon here, they kind of


432
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,906
agreed that Magic Wands were


433
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:44,116
often underwhelming, right?


434
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,586
The results felt simplistic or


435
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,396
cookie-cutter.


436
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:50,686
So in order for this control to


437
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,756
work and to be trusted by


438
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,216
people, they wanted to make sure


439
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:56,266
that the adjustments in the


440
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,396
photo were clearly reflected in


441
00:13:58,396 --> 00:13:58,906
the UI.


442
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:03,046
So what's happening kind of


443
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,466
behind the scenes is that their


444
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,486
models are identifying segments


445
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:08,136
of content inside the frame.


446
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,886
Water, sand and sky are detected


447
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,836
and treated independently, and


448
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:14,446
skin tone is as well.


449
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,466
But what makes this experience


450
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,946
so much different in my opinion


451
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,236
is how clearly the parameters


452
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,246
animate when the control is


453
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:25,856
activated, and the ease with


454
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,756
which I can go in and


455
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,136
independently adjust any of


456
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:29,446
them.


457
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,096
So check out how it's increased


458
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,896
the exposure of the landscape


459
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,916
while leaving the skin tone


460
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,446
alone.


461
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:39,646
And I can flip the switch to


462
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,696
deactivate them and then when I


463
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:44,326
reactivate it, my adjustments


464
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,076
are still there.


465
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:48,476
So it seems simple but it's


466
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:50,396
pretty remarkable when you use


467
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,376
it and you feel the sense of


468
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,696
confidence as you begin to


469
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,996
adjust and edit the photo.


470
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,486
So being able to see this as I


471
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,246
do it provides a sense of


472
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:03,736
comfort.


473
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,836
I can see what's happening when


474
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,136
I tap the Magic Wand and I can


475
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:09,216
go in and make my own


476
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,036
adjustments.


477
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:12,606
So there's a fancy word kind of


478
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,206
for this in user experience


479
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,876
terms and it's attribution.


480
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,856
I can see cause and effect.


481
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:20,896
I can visually connect the


482
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,166
effect of tapping the Magic Wand


483
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,066
to the series of independent


484
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:27,656
adjustments that's happening as


485
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:28,426
a result of it.


486
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,566
And this is empowering, right?


487
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,666
Pixelmator Photo is revealing


488
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,936
its intelligence to me and also


489
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,616
offering levers to adjust it


490
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:37,966
myself.


491
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,086
So you can trust an app when the


492
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,706
way that it works feels


493
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,126
transparent and when you can


494
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,606
establish a simple understanding


495
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:48,666
of what's happening.


496
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,906
So if I can understand or even


497
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,626
better visualize what's


498
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,576
happening, I'm much more likely


499
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,746
to trust it and to take


500
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:00,506
ownership over those results.


501
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,146
So you want to reveal what's


502
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,096
behind a recommendation and


503
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,976
offer ways to adjust it.


504
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,146
So that pretty much wraps up


505
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:12,556
trust.


506
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,906
>> Okay. Sounds good.


507
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:16,576
On to refinement.


508
00:16:17,836 --> 00:16:19,716
Now refinement is more than just


509
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:20,726
working out problems.


510
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,406
Refining something means that


511
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,596
you're going to fine-tune it,


512
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,986
hone it and make it more


513
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,486
precise.


514
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,336
Refining something means you're


515
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,236
going to make it better.


516
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,596
The Gardens Between is a game


517
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,886
with dream-like levels, soothing


518
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:38,686
art style and a heartwarming


519
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:39,146
story.


520
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:41,636
You have the power to go


521
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,036
forwards and backwards in time,


522
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:46,056
and you relive these experiences


523
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:47,426
of these two main characters


524
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:48,546
while solving puzzles.


525
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,346
I am blown away by the artistry


526
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,536
and cleverness in this game.


527
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,456
And I've always just been really


528
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:57,956
curious in how the developers


529
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,686
arrived at this truly unique


530
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:00,246
concept.


531
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:05,246
So I asked the developers and I


532
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,455
hoped that they would be willing


533
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,415
to share a few design artifacts


534
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,266
that they created along the way


535
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,096
while making The Gardens


536
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,616
Between.


537
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:13,526
And I expected to see a few


538
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,976
familiar things that reminded me


539
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:15,445
of the game.


540
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:17,976
But I didn't.


541
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,646
I was shocked to see that the


542
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:22,445
design artifacts didn't look


543
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:23,675
like the game at all.


544
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,836
These images reveal that The


545
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,336
Gardens Between started in a


546
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,886
very different place, in a place


547
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:32,596
of fairy tales with moments


548
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,716
showing Snow White about to eat


549
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,566
the poisoned apple.


550
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,056
Or Sleeping Beauty right as


551
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,426
she's about to fall into a curse


552
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,686
of deep sleep.


553
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,316
Other design artifacts showed


554
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:46,306
lost characters and some very


555
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,706
different appearances of the two


556
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,466
main characters named Arina and


557
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:49,836
Frendt.


558
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,646
And various iterations on


559
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:55,376
concepts for blocked paths and


560
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,556
experiments with onscreen


561
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:57,026
controls.


562
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,016
As I flipped through all of


563
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,896
these design artifacts, it


564
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:04,056
became really clear to me the


565
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,076
creative exploration that these


566
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,946
developers put into making the


567
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,456
game that we love today.


568
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:11,816
There are tons of different


569
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:14,596
styles and tones and directions


570
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:15,896
and perspectives that were all


571
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:16,446
considered.


572
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,856
Now I know this is a game


573
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:21,106
example but exploring ideas in


574
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:22,746
your designs applies to apps


575
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:22,956
too.


576
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,156
All of these amazing design


577
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:27,406
artifacts really show the power


578
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,136
of refinement, what can happen


579
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,286
when you take the time to truly


580
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,326
explore your ideas.


581
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:36,136
To stretch them, to think them


582
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:38,126
through over time and to distill


583
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,036
them down to their very essence.


584
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:43,586
Now I love this quote by Carlton


585
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:43,946
Cuse.


586
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:45,406
I'm going to paraphrase it a


587
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,976
bit, but it's basically saying


588
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,946
that the creative process is not


589
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:50,736
like getting struck by


590
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:51,196
lightning.


591
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,666
Along the way you must allow


592
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,896
yourself room for ideas to


593
00:18:55,896 --> 00:19:00,376
blossom, take root and grow.


594
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,986
So when you take the time to


595
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:04,426
fully think through your ideas,


596
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,246
you may discover new ones and


597
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,906
then you can validate designs by


598
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,146
refining them and in turn this


599
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:12,756
gives people a sense of depth.


600
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:14,856
And that really shines through


601
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,406
the final experience in your app


602
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:16,976
or game.


603
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,046
Refined designs feel considered


604
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,986
and they also feel thoughtful.


605
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,586
But this all takes time.


606
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,896
You can't rush this.


607
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:31,676
And iteration is really helpful


608
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:33,616
and also it's helpful for you to


609
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,736
explore really wild directions


610
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:38,626
in order to discover your


611
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:39,286
conclusion.


612
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,526
Now I really love that these


613
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:44,036
developers were so open to


614
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,196
sharing this incredible


615
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,916
transformation of this beautiful


616
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,486
game between two friends.


617
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:51,056
And you can feel all of the time


618
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,536
and effort that they put into


619
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:53,816
honing this experience.


620
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,206
And this experience is what we


621
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,966
feel in the end result.


622
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:00,876
Award-winning apps and games


623
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:02,826
rarely start with the same


624
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,966
designs they finish with.


625
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,736
And that's because great designs


626
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,056
are refined over time.


627
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,416
And through this process the


628
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,956
very best ideas are surfaced.


629
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:17,706
So take your time; explore and


630
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:20,186
sit with your ideas because you


631
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,526
may discover new ones through


632
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:22,726
the process of doing your own


633
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:23,026
work.


634
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,536
And by refining your designs,


635
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,506
you're going to be able to


636
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,646
justify every design decision in


637
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,766
your app or game, and as soon as


638
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,576
you can justify those decisions,


639
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,616
you know that you're much closer


640
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:36,286
to the final result that you've


641
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,646
been working towards the entire


642
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:37,956
time.


643
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:41,906
So all great apps and games go


644
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,226
through the process of


645
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:43,576
refinement.


646
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,206
>> You know, Lauren, we actually


647
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:47,856
have another great example of


648
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:48,506
refinement.


649
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,726
I want to talk about Butterfly


650
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:52,216
iQ.


651
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,596
Butterfly iQ is actually more


652
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:55,126
than an app.


653
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:57,656
It's portable ultrasound system,


654
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,976
and the system itself is super


655
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:00,596
innovative.


656
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,436
A handheld ultrasound device and


657
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,436
an app that runs on iPhone,


658
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:06,896
that's what makes it up.


659
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:08,836
So traditional ultrasound


660
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,486
devices are gigantic.


661
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:12,686
Really big.


662
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:13,716
They're big.


663
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,366
They have to be wheeled around


664
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,966
on a cart and plugged in.


665
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:19,706
They have dozens of knobs and


666
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,106
dials and buttons on them.


667
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:24,746
So you can really see in


668
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:27,306
Butterfly iQ how the portability


669
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:29,946
of their system can create a


670
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,236
whole new way for doctors to use


671
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:32,566
them.


672
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:34,606
And I want to show you how the


673
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:36,616
Butterfly iQ team refined their


674
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:38,506
ideas to get to something that


675
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,096
really works for doctors.


676
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,906
So when a doctor is using the


677
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:44,276
system, their attention is


678
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:45,206
actually split.


679
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:48,386
In one hand they have the device


680
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,996
that they're orienting on the


681
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:51,926
patient, and at the same time


682
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,436
they're referring to the phone


683
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:53,946
screen.


684
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,406
So they need to be able to


685
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,296
operate both one-handed.


686
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,896
The app serves as kind of a


687
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:02,276
visual stethoscope.


688
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:04,586
And the doctor needs to be able


689
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,786
to quickly refer to and adjust


690
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:08,676
the imagery and then to also


691
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:11,616
access contextual tools to make


692
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:12,976
measurements and notes.


693
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,446
In their early demos, they


694
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,676
created controls that mirrored


695
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:20,276
the controls from the ultrasound


696
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:22,196
cart with the idea that this


697
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:24,206
would feel familiar to doctors.


698
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:28,836
So the two values on the right


699
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,656
tell you how deep you're


700
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,206
looking.


701
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:32,756
That's the depth.


702
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:34,526
And the amount of contrast


703
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,256
you're applying, that's the


704
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:36,786
gain.


705
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,086
And they borrowed the behavior


706
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:40,676
of these buttons from the knobs


707
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,336
on the cart when doctors would


708
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,196
interact with them.


709
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,556
So in the early version, the


710
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:48,246
doctor would spin these controls


711
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:50,656
like the dial in a cart and the


712
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:53,866
dials in the phone in doing this


713
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,556
kind of matched the behavior


714
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:56,996
that the Butterfly iQ team


715
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,726
thought would be very familiar


716
00:22:58,726 --> 00:22:59,666
and very comfortable.


717
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:03,626
So in UI terms, they're kind of


718
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,106
implementing a metaphorical


719
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:05,606
dial.


720
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,316
And metaphors like this can be


721
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:09,566
super useful when you want to


722
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,776
help the person using the device


723
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:14,066
create a connection with a


724
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,106
real-world object.


725
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,036
And metaphors are all over the


726
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:19,106
place in UI's, right?


727
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:21,096
This is a metaphorical


728
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,786
calculator with metaphorical


729
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:23,776
buttons.


730
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,016
And our expectations of using


731
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,766
that calculator come from the


732
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:32,576
behavior that we've built up in


733
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,596
the real world using real-world


734
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,806
buttons like these.


735
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:39,536
But as the Butterfly iQ team


736
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,486
tested that demo, that 2016


737
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,436
demo, they found that a direct


738
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,426
translation of the dial didn't


739
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:48,186
feel right at all to doctors


740
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,426
because those values were taking


741
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,726
up valuable real estate.


742
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:55,696
So they refined it on this


743
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:56,096
theme.


744
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:58,656
They started by looking at other


745
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,656
apps and solved the problem --


746
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:02,296
how other apps had solved the


747
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,446
problem of viewing and editing


748
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:04,996
imagery.


749
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:07,116
And they drew inspiration from


750
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:08,776
the iOS Camera app.


751
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,926
So they considered the ways that


752
00:24:11,926 --> 00:24:13,676
people expect to interact with


753
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,076
objects in the camera view and


754
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:17,396
the ways that controls can be


755
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:19,026
accessed via gestures.


756
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,646
The way that those controls


757
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:22,466
animate in and then the way that


758
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,056
they recede when they're not in


759
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:24,476
use.


760
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:28,126
So now in the Butterfly iQ app,


761
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,286
panning left and right changes


762
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,646
the contrast and swiping up and


763
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,336
down changes the depth.


764
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,976
So they moved the information


765
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,226
out of the UI and allowed it to


766
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:41,806
be accessed via gestures.


767
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:43,886
And you can notice the ruler


768
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:45,286
down the right-hand side.


769
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,396
So as the doctor swipes down,


770
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,056

So transferring the persistent

00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,326

establish trust and comfort.


778
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:04,666
But instead it turned out that


779
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:06,616
that information and those dials


780
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:08,196

00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:12,636
feel confident.

00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:17,126
So creating those metaphorical


785
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,486
connections can be helpful, but


786
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:21,036
there's no copy and paste when

nailing a behavior.


788
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,306
You have to be willing to throw

790
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,146

You want to draw inspiration

simplicity of the game UI.


854

00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,106
absolutely beautiful and


964
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,176
immersive experience.


965
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,876
>> So aesthetics can be


966
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,786
captivating and immersive, but I


967
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,706
want to highlight the practical


968
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:44,106
benefits that they can have as


969
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:44,456
well.


970
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,056
And I want to show you a game


971
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:46,896
called ELOH.


972
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:51,126
ELOH uses unique visual style in


973
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,716
a couple of really practical


974
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:53,296
ways.


975
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,956
So it's a casual puzzle game and


976
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,616
it combines some familiar game


977
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:01,756
elements like the bouncing balls


978
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,226
and the movable obstacles.


979
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,886
And this looks and feels very


980
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,836
complete, so I want to show you


981
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:10,566
where they started and how they


982
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:11,156
got here.


983
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,576
So this is an alpha version of


984
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:14,946
ELOH.


985
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,466
So you can see that the puzzle


986
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:18,406
elements are there.


987
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,416
The essential mechanic is there,


988
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,076
the sounds, and it's even got


989
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,336
kind of a notion of the style


990
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:28,606
with the anthropomorphic face on


991
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:29,746
the obstacle.


992
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:31,646
And this is an example of a


993
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,306
higher level in that alpha.


994
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:36,846
Neither of these really resemble


995
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,736
the first screen that I showed


996
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:39,056
you.


997
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,986
But it's clear that they've got


998
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,686
kind of the mechanic nailed in


999
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,596
these early versions.


1000
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:46,846
So I want to walk you through


1001
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,086
the journey that they took from


1002
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:51,746
here to arrive at the game


1003
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,166
that's on the App Store.


1004
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,136
So the first step that the game


1005
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,846
designer took was to hire an


1006
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:57,576
illustrator.


1007
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:01,036
And the illustrator explored a


1008
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:03,426
color system and a graphic style


1009
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:05,206
and just in looking at those


1010
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:07,186
three examples, you could see


1011
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,086
how different the game could


1012
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,996
have been given the different


1013
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,466
tones and styles that he


1014
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:13,826
explored.


1015
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,886
So an app or game can be


1016
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:20,966
functional without being


1017
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:23,256
beautiful, but the beauty that


1018
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:24,576
ELOH's designer brought into the


1019
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,506
game does more than make it look


1020
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:26,846
good.


1021
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:29,706
It enhances the gameplay and


1022
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:31,716
brings visibility and life to


1023
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,966
the interactive elements.


1024
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:35,126
There aren't many interactive


1025
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,226
elements in the game, so they


1026
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:37,886
took care with each one, like


1027
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:39,376
this button that appears when


1028
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,766
you solve a puzzle.


1029
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,746
And the visual detail allowed


1030
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:45,106
the characters to really come


1031
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:45,636
alive.


1032
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:48,286
These little guys have so much


1033
00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:49,196
personality.


1034
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,186
When you drag an obstacle from


1035
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,606
place to place or when a ball


1036
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:54,956
hits it, it responds.


1037
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:57,396
And those small moments were


1038
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:58,976
really carefully considered.


1039
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:00,366
You could just tell that the


1040
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,236
animators were thinking about


1041
00:33:02,236 --> 00:33:03,966
what the face should look like


1042
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,346
when the ball hits it or when a


1043
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:08,726
finger pushes down on it.


1044
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:09,976
Pretty amazing.


1045
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,426
And the team brought in a sound


1046
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:13,986
designer.


1047
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,076
The sounds feel natural.


1048
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,686
When you succeed, the sounds are


1049
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:20,686
rhythmic, and the sound adapts


1050
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,446
to build drama and suspense


1051
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,106
within each level and between


1052
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:25,526
levels.


1053
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:28,726
So ELOH's aesthetics also deepen


1054
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:29,546
the experience.


1055
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:31,466
They connect emotionally with


1056
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:33,656
people while also reinforcing


1057
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:34,946
the intent of the game.


1058
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:37,786
So I want to make one more


1059
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:38,926
subtle point on this.


1060
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:40,906
The people that came together to


1061
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:43,556
create ELOH put so much work


1062
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:44,796
into the game, and I want to


1063
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:45,936
talk about a subtle thing that


1064
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,346
they did to give people a chance


1065
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,356
to enjoy the gameplay and the


1066
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:50,976
game's beauty.


1067
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:54,186
So they mentioned something


1068
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:55,326
interesting when I asked where


1069
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,426
the game came from.


1070
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:58,136
They said that modern puzzle


1071
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,486
games often fail to create


1072
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,906
long-lasting excitement because


1073
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,346
the only thing that happens is


1074
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:05,546
that the puzzles just get harder


1075
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,086
and harder.


1076
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:09,346
What's fun about that?


1077
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:11,696
Every puzzle game gets


1078
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,156
annoyingly difficult at some


1079
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:15,235
point and it's easy to just want


1080
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:15,565
to quit.


1081
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:17,746
But in ELOH, every once in a


1082
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:18,946
while when you finish an


1083
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,005
especially hard level, you find


1084
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:23,085
out that the next one is much


1085
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:23,726
simpler.


1086
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:26,956
And the aesthetics rise to the


1087
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:29,676
surface again and you can notice


1088
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:31,596
the craft of the characters and


1089
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:32,876
appreciate the rhythm of the


1090
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:33,525
soundtrack.


1091
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,346
Or turning the page.


1092
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,536
Ah.


1093
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:37,335
>> So nice.


1094
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:38,406
>> Simpler.


1095
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,696
So that's what I mean by the


1096
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:42,956
aesthetics having a practical


1097
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,485
benefit.


1098
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,275
The design matches the intent of


1099
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,565
the game, and the casual fun


1100
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,505
resurfaces every so often as you


1101
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,795
progress through 99 levels.


1102
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:56,076
So we expect aesthetics to be


1103
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:58,426
embodied in every element of the


1104
00:34:58,426 --> 00:34:59,776
app, and I want to show you one


1105
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,936
more quick thing that I think is


1106
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:02,556
awesome.


1107
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,606
The HomeCourt team really


1108
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,216
sweated the details with their


1109
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,116
app icon.


1110
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,156
The shapes in the icon clearly


1111
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,436
draw inspiration from the


1112
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:15,006
elements of a basketball court.


1113
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:17,306
So a great app icon allows


1114
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:18,836
people to quickly scan their


1115
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:21,016
home screen and map what they


1116
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,856
want to do to the intent of the


1117
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:23,136
app.


1118
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:26,376
The H and the C of HomeCourt


1119
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,936
emerge from the boundary lines


1120
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:28,976
of the basketball court.


1121
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:31,546
And the background is a clear


1122
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:32,976
call-out to the orange of a


1123
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:33,616
basketball.


1124
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:34,976
>> That's pretty cool, Doug.


1125
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:35,766
>> Right?


1126
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,946
>> Yeah. But I don't remember


1127
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,336
HomeCourt being in our agenda to


1128
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,516
be talking about aesthetics.


1129
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:41,016
>> Yeah.


1130
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,426
>> We were supposed to be


1131
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:45,286
talking about Thumper, ELOH and


1132
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:45,616
Ordia.


1133
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:48,496
>> What more is there to say?


1134
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:48,686
[Laughs]


1135
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,796
>> Well, I just want to make


1136
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:52,026
sure we have time to talk about


1137
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,986
how aesthetics can create


1138
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,196
something that feels really


1139
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:55,676
cohesive.


1140
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:57,846
And that aesthetics can give an


1141
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:00,186
app a perception of quality


1142
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,816
through a really clear and


1143
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:03,136
consistent design language.


1144
00:36:03,866 --> 00:36:05,906
Now Ordia is a game that tells a


1145
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:07,256
story about the struggles of


1146
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,756
early primordial life.


1147
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,296
And I just love the organic


1148
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,136
blobbiness of everything in


1149
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:15,386
Ordia, from the menus to the


1150
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,376
transitions, levels, characters.


1151
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:19,946
I mean, this blobby theme is


1152
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:21,486
carried through everything in


1153
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:22,846
the entire game experience.


1154
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:25,036
There's also clever sound design


1155
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:26,406
and haptics to create a really


1156
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,526
rich atmosphere to enhance this


1157
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:30,056
incredibly sticky world.


1158
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:32,936
And every screen sticks


1159
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:33,406
together.


1160
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,396
They family really well.


1161
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,776
Ordia's design language is


1162
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:38,596
meaningful.


1163
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,306
It helps communicate to people


1164
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:42,866
what's interactive, what isn't,


1165
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:44,836
and also the colors help people


1166
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,136
know what's friendly when it's


1167
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:46,816
in the game.


1168
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:50,366
So to quote the developer, they


1169
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:52,066
wanted to have the player always


1170
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,346
feel like they were in the same


1171
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:53,976
environment.


1172
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,706
The same environment.


1173
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:58,236
I think that's a great goal for


1174
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,336
your app or game.


1175
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,716
To create cohesion and


1176
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,776
consistency between every aspect


1177
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:04,536
of your design.


1178
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:07,726
So your app or game also needs


1179
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,076
to feel connected to the


1180
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,726
platform to be truly cohesive.


1181
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:12,936
So you can tell that Ordia was


1182
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,916
designed for iOS just by taking


1183
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,386
a look at the Share icon.


1184
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,886
This seemingly simple design


1185
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,726
decision makes a really big


1186
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:22,306
difference in helping people


1187
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:24,446
understand your app and also


1188
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:26,046
making it feel at home in the


1189
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,206
platform it runs on.


1190
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:30,006
Now I know it's really hard work


1191
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:32,766
to create designs that stick


1192
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,726
together, especially when it


1193
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:36,496
feels like creating an app or


1194
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:39,406
game can be an endless upwards


1195
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:39,886
climb.


1196
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:43,036
But by creating a cohesive


1197
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:45,106
design, it raises the overall


1198
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,436
quality of your experience.


1199
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:49,096
So to make your app or game


1200
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:51,416
cohesive, create a consistent


1201
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,296
design language.


1202
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:55,386
Lay out every single screen


1203
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,486
side-by-side and ask yourself,


1204
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,986
does anything feel out of place?


1205
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:02,076
And if it does, replace it with


1206
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:03,346
something that families better.


1207
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,886
And finally, cohesiveness


1208
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:08,046
applies to how your app or game


1209
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,136
runs on the platform.


1210
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:11,396
And just to tie this all back to


1211
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:13,986
aesthetics, in Thumper aesthetic


1212
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:15,986
beauty helped create immersion.


1213
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:18,226
>> ELOH shows how these


1214
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:19,856
aesthetics support the intended


1215
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:21,516
behavior or experience.


1216
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:23,826
And aesthetics are embodied in


1217
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:25,456
every element of the app, down


1218
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:26,286
to its icon.


1219
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,176
>> Nice.


1220
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,786
And creating consistent


1221
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:32,806
experience is really important


1222
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,926
with a cohesive design language.


1223
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:35,156
>> Okay.


1224
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:36,776
>> And that's aesthetics.


1225
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:39,536
>> Yeah. So let's go on to the


1226
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:41,096
next subtle theme running


1227
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:43,096
through all great apps, and


1228
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:44,546
that's that they're inclusive.


1229
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,156
So when we talk about inclusion


1230
00:38:47,156 --> 00:38:48,406
in design, we mean that


1231
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,246
interfaces are usable by


1232
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:50,896
everyone.


1233
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:52,996
So let's go back to Pixelmator


1234
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:54,776
Photo for just a moment and look


1235
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,266
at one of the benefits of using


1236
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:58,146
native components to ensure as


1237
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,906
many people as possible can use


1238
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:00,346
your app.


1239
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:03,006
I want to focus on one element:


1240
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,706
the native UI switch.


1241
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,816
Here it works nicely as a way of


1242
00:39:06,816 --> 00:39:08,576
activating or deactivating


1243
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:09,396
parameters.


1244
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,866
It clearly communicates the


1245
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,516
state of each parameter and


1246
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,736
provides a way to remove it and


1247
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,306
add it again without losing


1248
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:17,546
work.


1249
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:20,796
When I asked the Pixelmator team


1250
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,766
about this, they said originally


1251
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:23,976
they were going to bring over


1252
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:28,116
the controls from their Mac app.


1253
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:29,666
And while the appearance is


1254
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,416
similar, the checkboxes don't


1255
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:34,386
pop or communicate as clearly as


1256
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:35,366
the switch.


1257
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:39,276
And not only is the switch a


1258
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,716
familiar iOS element, it's also


1259
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:43,496
accessible.


1260
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,506
In the Accessibility section of


1261
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:47,016
the Settings app, people can


1262
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:48,656
turn on labels that allow these


1263
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,176
switches to be even more


1264
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:50,856
legible.


1265
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,646
So using standard components


1266
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,186
creates consistency,


1267
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,086
predictability and legibility


1268
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,716
across apps and devices.


1269
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:03,246
So Lauren, I know you have an


1270
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:04,796
awesome example of inclusion as


1271
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:05,086
well.


1272
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:06,246
>> Yeah, totally.


1273
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:08,226
I want to go back to Ordia.


1274
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:11,626
Now in Ordia, every creature has


1275
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,186
a color that communicates to the


1276
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,646
player whether it's good, bad or


1277
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,306
meant to aid in navigation.


1278
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:19,056
The developer didn't want to


1279
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:20,706
exclude anyone from being able


1280
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:22,326
to understand the game, so they


1281
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,936
support a colorblind mode for


1282
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:24,806
people with partial


1283
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:25,576
colorblindness.


1284
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,866
To create this, the developers


1285
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,146
took screenshots of the game,


1286
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:31,256
applied filters to stimulate


1287
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:31,956
different types of


1288
00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:33,806
colorblindness and then worked


1289
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,616
on rebalancing those colors to


1290
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:36,546
make them more distinct.


1291
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,916
And they made every single


1292
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,666
design element distinctive to


1293
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,156
include people with full


1294
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:44,056
colorblindness.


1295
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,266
So they also tested the game in


1296
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:47,326
pure monochrome.


1297
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:50,366
With over 300 million people


1298
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,316
worldwide with some form of


1299
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,216
colorblindness, Ordia is


1300
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:55,486
wonderfully inclusive.


1301
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,186
So to get started, design for


1302
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,416
everyone and investigate if your


1303
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,276
app or game is inclusive and


1304
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:03,796
accessible.


1305
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:05,486
>> More and more Apple


1306
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,716
frameworks and elements are made


1307
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,856
accessible with each release, so


1308
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,316
the more you use native


1309
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,946
frameworks, the more people will


1310
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:13,416
be able to use your app.


1311
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:15,186
>> All right, we're in the home


1312
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:15,636
stretch.


1313
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,336
Hang tight.


1314
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:17,986
We're going to move on to


1315
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:19,346
attention to detail.


1316
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:21,396
>> Attention to detail is a core


1317
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,366
value at Apple.


1318
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:23,866
It's something we strive to do


1319
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,276
in everything that we do.


1320
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:27,386
>> Meticulous and deliberately


1321
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:29,356
designed apps and games are the


1322
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:31,676
outcome of hard work, the desire


1323
00:41:31,676 --> 00:41:34,176
for perfection, and it's also a


1324
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:36,306
telltale sign that the people


1325
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:37,836
that created the app or game


1326
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,886
cared about every single aspect


1327
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:42,046
of the experience down to the


1328
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,536
last pixel.


1329
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,966
So let's talk about Flow by


1330
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:46,586
Moleskine.


1331
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:49,016
This is a drawing app that has a


1332
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:51,206
continual horizontal canvas with


1333
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:52,806
a fully customizable set of


1334
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:53,206
tools.


1335
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:56,316
This app has one goal and it's


1336
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:58,316
to help you stay in a state of


1337
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,316
creative flow.


1338
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,096
Now we're just going to focus in


1339
00:42:01,096 --> 00:42:02,676
on one element of this app that


1340
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,676
showcases a tremendous amount of


1341
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:05,696
attention to detail.


1342
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:08,786
Flow's tool and color selector


1343
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:10,366
is one of the most comprehensive


1344
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:11,876
and easy to use that we have


1345
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:12,726
ever seen.


1346
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:14,736
Now you can tell how much the


1347
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:16,186
developer cared about every


1348
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:17,416
aspect of this experience,


1349
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:20,076
because the number of colors


1350
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:21,036
feel endless.


1351
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:22,786
And the interaction from


1352
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:24,516
changing the hue, brightness and


1353
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:26,286
saturation provides immediate


1354
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:26,596
feedback.


1355
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:29,216
To create this experience, the


1356
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,986
developer spent countless hours


1357
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:31,886
prototyping.


1358
00:42:32,406 --> 00:42:33,446
Now here's an example of a


1359
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:35,286
prototype that was designed to


1360
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:36,336
check the interaction


1361
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:37,506
fundamentals first.


1362
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,076
They used pure text buttons so


1363
00:42:40,076 --> 00:42:41,106
they wouldn't get distracted by


1364
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,336
high-fidelity designs.


1365
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:44,876
That way they could focus on the


1366
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:46,646
detail of perfecting each


1367
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,436
interaction of the tool editor.


1368
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,676
Only after the interactions felt


1369
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,496
good did the developers at Flow


1370
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:55,036
move on to visual design.


1371
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:58,446
Then they iterated to perfect


1372
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,036
the details of each individual


1373
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,386
tool over time.


1374
00:43:02,176 --> 00:43:04,006
And they simplified how unique


1375
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:05,286
properties of the tool were


1376
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:07,396
displayed from the nibs, colors


1377
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:08,076
and labels.


1378
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:10,526
And finally, I just want to call


1379
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:12,146
out how animation brings this


1380
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,756
entire experience together.


1381
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:16,276
In the real world, things


1382
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:17,866
transition smoothly from one


1383
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:18,946
state to another.


1384
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:21,326
And it's reflected beautifully


1385
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:22,466
in the Tool Editor here.


1386
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,506
Animation is so much more than a


1387
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:26,986
series of screens connected by


1388
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:27,696
transitions.


1389
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:30,396
Really good animation reminds


1390
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:32,376
people how to use your UI.


1391
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:34,396
And it provides feedback and


1392
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:35,606
also draws your attention


1393
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:36,296
onscreen.


1394
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:38,906
But that's not all.


1395
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,856
There are over 1,400 unique


1396
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:43,906
color names in this app.


1397
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:45,786
And when I asked the developer


1398
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:49,676
how long it took, they said, "A


1399
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:49,976
while."


1400
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,786
In addition to collecting and


1401
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:55,496
sourcing these color names, the


1402
00:43:55,496 --> 00:43:57,306
developer sweated the details to


1403
00:43:57,306 --> 00:44:00,546
determine what the rules were


1404
00:44:00,546 --> 00:44:02,496
for each color and how it mapped


1405
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:04,156
to each color value.


1406
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:06,856
The tool palette with an


1407
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:08,446
expansive color selection


1408
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:10,456
enables creative expression.


1409
00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:12,386
And that stays true to the app's


1410
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,866
goal of helping you stay in a


1411
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:15,866
creative mindset.


1412
00:44:17,146 --> 00:44:19,156
The developer absolutely nailed


1413
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:21,876
the purpose, expanse and joy of


1414
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,756
this experience all through the


1415
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:25,566
details that come together.


1416
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:28,696
Now attention to detail helps


1417
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,986
your app or game stand out.


1418
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,016
It's all about taking the time


1419
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:35,666
and being comfortable staying in


1420
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,136
the process of designing.


1421
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,176
And you don't want to settle for


1422
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,786
your first idea or your first


1423
00:44:40,786 --> 00:44:41,276
design.


1424
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:43,836
It's about being methodical.


1425
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:45,716
Solve the really big problems


1426
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,396
first, just like Flow did with


1427
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:48,996
interaction in that prototype we


1428
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,866
saw, before you move on to


1429
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:52,166
adding further detail like


1430
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,856
visual design animation.


1431
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,976
And I love this statement from a


1432
00:44:56,976 --> 00:44:58,096
really good friend of mine.


1433
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:00,696
At the end of the day, when


1434
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:02,286
someone experiences your app or


1435
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,196
game, they should be able to see


1436
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:04,976
the developer's sweat.


1437
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:09,786
>> That is kind of gross.


1438
00:45:09,786 --> 00:45:10,806
>> Oh come on, it's not that


1439
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:10,976
gross.


1440
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:11,816
>> But I think I know what you


1441
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:12,226
mean.


1442
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,706
>> Yeah, I think what they mean


1443
00:45:14,706 --> 00:45:16,316
is it shows that the developer


1444
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:19,136
totally cared about every aspect


1445
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,166
of the experience down to the


1446
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,816
very last pixel.


1447
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:25,976
>> So we talked about immersion,


1448
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:28,516
trust -- sorry -- innovation,


1449
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:30,556
trust, refinement, aesthetics,


1450
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:32,176
inclusion and attention to


1451
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:34,626
detail with a single example


1452
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:36,946
with each award-winning app and


1453
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:37,596
game.


1454
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,236
>> But all of these apps and


1455
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:42,506
games embody these qualities of


1456
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,286
great design.


1457
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,996
>> These developers sweated the


1458
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,466
details and created memorable


1459
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:49,356
experiences.


1460
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:51,606
>> Those experiences are totally


1461
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:52,876
immersive and fun.


1462
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:56,436
>> And everyone, by taking risks


1463
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:57,866
and staying true to a vision,


1464
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,266
they provided access to things


1465
00:46:00,266 --> 00:46:02,146
that people didn't have before.


1466
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:04,096
>> And all of these apps and


1467
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:05,896
games are original.


1468
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:07,956
There's no copy and paste in the


1469
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:10,536
world of great design.


1470
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:11,856
>> These innovations extended


1471
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:13,296
the reach of care to millions of


1472
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:14,506
people around the world.


1473
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:16,726
So we want to thank the


1474
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:17,926
developers who shared their


1475
00:46:17,926 --> 00:46:18,956
stories with us.


1476
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,636
>> It was an honor to get a peek


1477
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:21,896
behind the curtain at how you


1478
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,126
designed your award-winning apps


1479
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:23,856
and games.


1480
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:25,956
>> [Together] Thank you so much


1481
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:27,536
and have a great WWDC.


1482
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:30,241
[ Applause ]


1483
00:46:30,466 --> 00:46:30,676
>> All right.


1484
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:35,500
[ Applause ]
