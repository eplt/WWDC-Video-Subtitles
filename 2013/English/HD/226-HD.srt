1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,456
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:10,856
>> Hey, Brandon.


3
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:11,726
>> Hey Jim, how's it going?


4
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,426
>> Oh, it's going really well.


5
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,906
I just got the DemoApp done


6
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:16,796
for this presentation
about 15 minutes ago.


7
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:17,866
>> Oh, that's great timing.


8
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,736
I have a 50K run this weekend
that I really wanted to use it


9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,596
for to get some pictures.


10
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,746
What features have you
put together so far?


11
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:26,006
>> Well, I got the basic
functionality working.


12
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:28,616
When you have the phone taped to
your chest while you're running,


13
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,146
it's going to take a
photo of what's in front


14
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:31,416
of you every three
or four seconds.


15
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,296
And then when you're
done with your run,


16
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,626
you could show the photos
to your other runners


17
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:38,146
and there's some basic
editing functionality


18
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,476
like you can delete
photos that were blurry


19
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:42,466
and you can set favorites
as a background.


20
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:43,426
>> That's great.


21
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:46,376
So, I know you probably haven't
done much on the user interface


22
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,146
yet but that's really
a good thing


23
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:50,406
because we just got some brand
new specs from our designers


24
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,466
to make our app look
great on iOS 7.


25
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:52,906
>> Oh, good.


26
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:53,826
>> Let's take a look at them.


27
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:54,136
>> Cool.


28
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,806
>> So, here's what our designers
have put together for us.


29
00:00:57,926 --> 00:01:00,746
We can have the ability to
view photos in our application


30
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,006
and delete ones that
we don't like.


31
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:04,325
And I'd like us to do this
interesting custom delete


32
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,406
animation where we kind
of shadow the photo out.


33
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:06,886
>> Oh, neat, neat.


34
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:08,076
Kind of like a [inaudible]
effect.


35
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,096
>> Yeah, something like that.


36
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,156
I think it'd be pretty cool.


37
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:10,526
>> Cool.


38
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:13,056
>> They've also defined
some custom appearance


39
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:13,796
in our application.


40
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,866
They like our buttons to look
a little bit more interesting


41
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,936
with some special arts and
they've given us a tint color


42
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,856
for our application
to have its own style.


43
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,476
>> Excellent.


44
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:22,756
Yeah, I think the Appearance
API could probably help us


45
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:22,996
out with that.


46
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:23,776
>> That's what I was thinking.


47
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,866
They've also asked us
to do an interesting way


48
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,956
of playing back photos
in our application.


49
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,406
And they've put together
the spec that shows a kind


50
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,606
of a bouncing effect
where photos kind of fly


51
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:36,366
in from behind the user and,
you know, bounce off-screen.


52
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:37,926
>> Oh, that's a neat effect.


53
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,356
I have-- we'll see what
we can do with that.


54
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,106
>> I was thinking dynamics
that help with that.


55
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,126
>> Oh, yeah, actually,
that's a good idea.


56
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,116
>> Then the last thing
that showed us is


57
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,566
in our home screen
of our application.


58
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,866
They'd like to do some blurring


59
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,206
and they put together
this really,


60
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,686
really interesting looking
LensFlare that they'd like us


61
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:53,376
to drop on photos because
everyone loves LensFlares.


62
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,766
>> That one is a-- that flare
is a little [inaudible], man.


63
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,416
I'll see what I can do.


64
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,796
>> We'll see what
we can put together.


65
00:01:57,796 --> 00:01:58,596
>> All right, cool.


66
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,596
>> So, why don't you go set up
the demo and I'll get started.


67
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:01,376
>> All right, cool.


68
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:05,036
>> Cool. So, we're going to
talk about three things today.


69
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,326
We're going to start
off our talk by talking


70
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,566
about how we can do custom
view controller transitions.


71
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,606
After that, we'll move on to how
you can customize the appearance


72
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:16,466
of your application using
things like UIAppearance


73
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,746
and some new features
we've added to iOS 7


74
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,716
for making images look
interesting in your app.


75
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,136
Finally, we're going
to wrap things


76
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,906
up by spending some
time talking about how


77
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:29,156
to add realistic motion to your
application using UIKit Dynamics


78
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:31,276
and the new motion effect APIs.


79
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,376
So, let's get started by talking


80
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,286
about custom view
controller transitions.


81
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:39,376
This is something we've added in
iOS 7 that makes it really easy


82
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,896
for you to customize and
make unique transitions


83
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,056
in your application,
and we're using these


84
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:45,806
across the operating
system as well.


85
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,466
So, if you take a look at
a navigation controller


86
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,166
like this one in mail, this
is actually an interactive


87
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,226
transition where when
you start to scroll back


88
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,606
from the left-to-right
edge gesture, you notice,


89
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:57,736
the user can actually
interact with it and kind


90
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:58,796
of pull it back and forth.


91
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:01,886
And notice how the text
slides differently in the top


92
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:04,276
and those two view controllers
move at different speeds


93
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,626
across the transition.


94
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,216
We create this using the
new view controller APIs.


95
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:12,146
These are great way to make
things look interesting


96
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:12,836
in your apps.


97
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,676
There's a number of things
that we allow you to customize


98
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:17,246
with those view controller
transitions.


99
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,586
You can customize
both the present


100
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:23,296
and dismiss animations review
controllers as well as pushing


101
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:25,556
and popping things off
of your navigation stack.


102
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,836
Now, in addition to
letting you customize all


103
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:30,396
of these different
types of transitions,


104
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,226
we're also giving you
the ability to make any


105
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,486
of them interactive
or non-interactive.


106
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,156
That way, you can decide if
you want just a fluid thing


107
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:40,466
that always happens without
the user touching anything


108
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:42,286
or if you want to build
something a little bit more


109
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:44,126
advanced like a navigation
controller


110
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,416
where the user can
actually feel it and play


111
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,696
with it as it transitions.


112
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:52,236
So, what do you need
to do if you want


113
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:55,296
to customize a view controller
transition in your application?


114
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,316
In this example, we have
our first view controller,


115
00:03:58,316 --> 00:03:59,976
we'll call this our
two view controller.


116
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:02,596
When we're ready to do
a transition into that,


117
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,606
that modal view visibility view,


118
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,326
we're going to create
a two view controller,


119
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:08,926
our photo detail view.


120
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:12,166
So now, we have our two view
controllers, the one on the left


121
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,656
that we're going to present
from, the one on the right


122
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,426
that we're about to
present to the user.


123
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:18,916
Once we've created
the view controller,


124
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,875
we need to specify the
transitioning delegate.


125
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,226
So, in this case, we're going
to tell our two view controller


126
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:28,926
that the transitioning delegate
itself are fromViewController.


127
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,976
That means our
fromViewController is going


128
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,506
to be responsible for responding


129
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,566
to how these transitions
need to happen.


130
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:38,876
Once we've set that up, we need
to go ahead and say we're ready


131
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,046
to present our view controller,


132
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:43,106
and we do that by saying
presentViewController


133
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,526
animated completion.


134
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,486
This is the same API
that you're used to using


135
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,216
for presenting the
view controllers.


136
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,146
But in this case,
we've specified


137
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,506
that you have a transitioning
delegate and that means


138
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,206
that the system is going to
have to ask you how do you want


139
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,206
to do that transition.


140
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,596
And we do that by asking
you for AnimationController


141
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,766
for presented controller,


142
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,286
presenting controller,
source controller.


143
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,206
That's a lot of controllers
going on there.


144
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:09,846
So, let's talk about what
those actually mean for you.


145
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,176
The first is the
presented controller.


146
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,446
This is what we're going


147
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,236
to actually be presenting
on screen.


148
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,956
It's the [inaudible]
we're about to present.


149
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,896
That's the two view
controller on the right.


150
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,476
Next is the presenting
controller.


151
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,526
This is what we're going to be
presenting from, in this case,


152
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,596
our fromViewController.


153
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,676
The final case is the
source controller.


154
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:33,216
The source controller in
most cases is the same view


155
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,076
controller that we're presenting
from but occasionally,


156
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,946
we have to do a little
bit of work to present


157
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,506
from a different place in the
view cart controller hierarchy.


158
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:43,466
So, we'll do the walking
through and let you know


159
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,436
if we're presenting from
a slightly different case


160
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,486
and we'll let you know that
with the source controller.


161
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,686
But most of the time,
you don't need


162
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:52,206
to do anything too interesting
with that particular argument.


163
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,566
It's there for your information.


164
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,696
So, we've been called
with a system asking


165
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,066
for this animation controller.


166
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,406
We're going to create a new
object, and that's an object


167
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:02,906
that responds


168
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:05,356
to UIViewController
animated transitioning.


169
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,766
It's a protocol that you need
to implement on this object


170
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,676
that specifies how to
perform the animation.


171
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:12,916
There's two methods that
you need to implement,


172
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:16,166
transition-duration
and animate transition.


173
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,866
Transition-duration, as
the name would suggest is


174
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,356
to tell the system how long your
transition is going to take.


175
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,616
That way, we can time things out
and make everything work nicely.


176
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:29,236
Animate transition is
where you actually do all


177
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:30,106
of the animations.


178
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,616
So, that's where
you're going to want


179
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:33,906
to get the two view
controllers out of a context


180
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:36,236
and then you're going to need
to actually do the animations


181
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:37,376
that you want to have happen


182
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,366
to place your view
controllers on screen.


183
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,436
Once we've created that
object, we'll return it back


184
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,706
to the system and let
it do the transition.


185
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:48,796
To help you make this a little
bit easier in your applications,


186
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:52,356
we've created UI percent
driven interactive transition.


187
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,196
This is an object
that we're get--


188
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:58,316
making available in UIKit to
help make it easier for you


189
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,176
to create interactive
transitions.


190
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,456
It lets you update
the transition


191
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,276
as it's happening based
on touch or other inputs


192
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,176
that might be relevant
to your application,


193
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,646
whatever makes sense for you


194
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,856
and creates a great
experience for your users.


195
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:14,596
And a couple of things that you
can vary while the transition is


196
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,816
happening is the completion
speed and the completion curve.


197
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,026
You can tweak the values of
those while the transition is


198
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,886
in flight to make an even
more unique experience


199
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:26,886
and a more unique
transition inside your app.


200
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,746
So, Jim, if you remember
what our designer specs,


201
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,296
they put together this
really great delete animation


202
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:36,066
where we kind of destroy
the photo that's on screen.


203
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:37,916
Have you had a chance to
put that together yet?


204
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,656
>> Well, I've got it started.


205
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,696
The animation isn't
quite complete yet


206
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,346
but I got the transitioning
stuff working.


207
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,386
You want me to show it to them?


208
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,536
>> I'd love to see
what you have so far.


209
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,366
>> All right, now here's our
exciting application that's


210
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,616
on the store today.


211
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,526
All right.


212
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:52,916
So, we have bascially,
we have some runs


213
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:54,156
that we've already ran through.


214
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:58,036
And I'm going to select
the WWDC run and want to go


215
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:01,346
and show all the photos that
we've taken from this run.


216
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:04,316
This is obviously around
the campus and you can go


217
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,666
and select one of
your photos here.


218
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,646
That's a nice photo.


219
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,276
We have a basic presentation
right there.


220
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,326
And if you go ahead and
hit delete, you're going


221
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:16,236
to get a nice little-- it's
a nice little burning effect.


222
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,826
It's not quite what
we got there yet but--


223
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,906
the scanline goes up,
removes the images.


224
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:22,876
It's basic animation.


225
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:25,126
There's no real dynamics
that's into it yet.


226
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,126
It's doesn't move around a lot.


227
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:29,026
But, it's a basic-- the
transition is actually working.


228
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,106
So, let me go show you how that
actually is working so far.


229
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:34,366
So, the photos that you saw
there are in a collection view.


230
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,706
And so, in our collection
view, we simply--


231
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,686
and collection view's
delegate method


232
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,426
of didSelectItemAtIndexPath,
we're simply going


233
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:44,265
to create a new instance of
the edit photo view controller.


234
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:48,566
And at the next part, we're
going to go and create a couple


235
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,286
of properties that when you
set on that view controller


236
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,186
to basically do what
our app does.


237
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,426
We need to know which run we're
talking about and which photo


238
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:56,356
that we're interacting with.


239
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,376
We also have a custom
delegation callback that's going


240
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,826
to get called when that
user hits the delete button


241
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,346
and that is to let us know
that the user deleted the photo


242
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,396
and it also dismisses
the view controller.


243
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,796
Now, the important part
of this when dealing


244
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,456
with custom transitions
are these two lines.


245
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,666
The transitioning delegate
is what's going to be asked


246
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,256
for if you have an animator
that you would like to use.


247
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,616
In this case, we do.


248
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:24,056
And the modal presentation
style has set the custom.


249
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,116
And it's not required
that you set up the custom


250
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:29,076
but in our case, we would like
to do that and when you set it


251
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:31,946
to custom, you get the
opportunity to place both the


252
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,326
from and the two view
controller on screen.


253
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,436
You are responsible for
both animating them in


254
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,426
and animating them out.


255
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,556
And then, obviously
represent the view controller.


256
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,276
Now, since we're just
concerned with the dismissal


257
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:48,546
of our editing view controller,
if the user deleted the photo,


258
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,886
we go ahead and we
create an instance


259
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,196
of our delete photo animator.


260
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:54,106
And if it's not being deleted,


261
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,926
we just use the normal
presentation animator.


262
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,206
So, let's go take a look at
what the delete photo animator


263
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:58,886
actually does.


264
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,586
Animation-- Transition-duration
is just two seconds.


265
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,666
Like Brandon, this just lets
the system know how long your


266
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,566
animation is going to take.


267
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:08,226
And then the second part
here is animateTransition.


268
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,896
Now, in this method, we're going


269
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:13,636
to pass you a transition
context.


270
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,136
And in this context is
everything that you're going


271
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:18,606
to need to know to
do your transition.


272
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,446
Not only do you get the from
in the two view controller,


273
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:24,756
you get, is this
transition animated.


274
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:29,366
You also get the ability to
know the from and to positions


275
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,126
of where we think
those view should land.


276
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,736
You also get a critically
important method you'll need


277
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:37,446
to call back called
completed transition.


278
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:41,036
If you don't call this
method, we don't know


279
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,556
that the animation
is actually finished.


280
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,626
So, your transition
will actually just hang


281
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,886
and I'll show you where we do


282
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,446
that here just a
little bit lower.


283
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,816
Now, there is a bunch
of animation code here


284
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:55,016
that really doesn't matter for
the aspect of transitioning, so.


285
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:57,246
But there are three points that
I'd like to point out here.


286
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:03,666
The first is that we don't
really care where the two view--


287
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,806
we don't want to animate it in.


288
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,906
We just want to place it
in its final position.


289
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,236
So, that is our collection
view coming back


290
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,126
as the front-most
view controller.


291
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:14,236
So, we just asked the
transition in context


292
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,946
for where we should place
that and we stick it


293
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:17,416
in the container view.


294
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,206
The second part is that
I'm using snapshotting,


295
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:26,616
the snapshotting API to
create those little tiny boxes


296
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,286
on screen.


297
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,306
That's an image view
that holds an image


298
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:33,026
and while we could have gone
through and re-rendered each one


299
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,066
of those boxes as its own image,


300
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,136
it's like an image
view in there.


301
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:39,856
The snapshotting API is
actually faster in that regard.


302
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,396
It's really performance
and it allows us


303
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,176
to [inaudible] those
little boxes into--


304
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,916
sort of create those little
boxes really, really quickly.


305
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,156
And unfortunately,
it's commented


306
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,946
out in the sample code
due to a name change


307
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,406
between Seed 1 and Seed 2.


308
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,976
So, I didn't want
to show errors.


309
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:54,716
But Brandon will talk
to a little bit more


310
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,276
about that after I'm done here.


311
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,146
Finally, going through a
whole bunch of animation code,


312
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,766
it's this line right here.


313
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,726
When we are done
with our animation,


314
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,606
when the scanline is
completed to the top


315
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,096
and we're sufficiently happy
enough blocks have been


316
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,446
destroyed, we call
transitionContext


317
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:15,756
CompletedTransition and
in this, this system knows


318
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,276
that your delegate
transition, it can tear down all


319
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,656
of its context that it's
built up for you and then,


320
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,066
it will return back to
the two view controller.


321
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:25,386
>> That's looking great, Jim.


322
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:25,856
>> Thanks.


323
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,676
>> It's a really good start
on that custom transition.


324
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:29,076
I think I'd like
to talk a bit more


325
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,366
about snapshotting
now if you don't mind.


326
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:31,046
>> That's a good idea.


327
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:33,986
>> So, we've introduced
a fantastic new API


328
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,866
in iOS 7 that's called
UISnapshotting.


329
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:40,426
This is a major improvement
over rendering context


330
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,996
that you're used
to using for trying


331
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,076
to get snapshots of a view.


332
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,796
What we give you back with the
new snapshotting API is the


333
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,616
extremely fast representation


334
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,716
of the currently rendered
contents of your view.


335
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,946
We go really deep in and
pull that out for you.


336
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:55,556
And like I said,
it's extremely fast.


337
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,716
It's useful in a
couple of great places.


338
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,486
As you just saw, we can do
some really interesting things


339
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,146
with custom transitions and
the new snapshotting API.


340
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,736
It's also a great
tool for making some


341
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:08,396
of the new special effects
that you see across iOS 7.


342
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:12,006
So, how much faster is this
than rendering context?


343
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:16,256
To kind of demonstrate this to
you, we took a version of iPhoto


344
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,616
for iOS and we've asked it
to render in context as well


345
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,166
as using the new snapshot APIs.


346
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,286
As you can see, this is a pretty
complicated view to render.


347
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,176
If we render this with
rendering context,


348
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,526
it took about 840 milliseconds.


349
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,166
It's a really long time to
generate just a snapshot.


350
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:37,376
To compare that, when we use the
new snapshot methods in iOS 7,


351
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,876
we did the same in
56 milliseconds.


352
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,446
It's an incredible improvement
for you and you should be able


353
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,196
to make some incredibly
awesome effects


354
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,756
with it once you can take
advantage of it in iOS 7.


355
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:49,106
So, what does the API
for this look like?


356
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,966
There's two key methods that
you should take a look at,


357
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,066
snapshot view and
resizable snapshot view


358
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,046
from rect with cap insets.


359
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,336
Now, as Jim mentioned, it's
important to note in Seed 1,


360
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:03,406
these methods are snapshot
and resizable snapshot,


361
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:07,596
they'll be this API you see
above for Seed 2 moving forward.


362
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:11,176
There's a third bit of API
for UISnapshotting though


363
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,546
that we've created for
a very special case,


364
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,676
and that API is
drawViewHierarchyInRect.


365
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,806
This will also be
available starting


366
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,306
in Seed 2 going forwards.


367
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,766
DrawViewHierarchyInRect is
still considerably faster


368
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,096
than rendering context
but it's not quite


369
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,666
as fast as snapshot view.


370
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:31,266
To give you an illustration
of that, we can compare


371
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,346
that on our usual
graph and rendering


372
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:36,446
that complicated view hierarchy
took about 150 milliseconds.


373
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,376
It's still considerably
faster than rendering context


374
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,406
but almost three times
slower than snapshot view.


375
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:46,466
So, why should you use this
drawViewHierarchyInRect?


376
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:50,896
Well, you've probably noticed
iOS 7 takes a lot of advantage


377
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:53,456
of these blurred effects
that you see behind toolbars


378
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,106
and navigation bars and so on.


379
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:59,676
This is your new API in iOS 7
to make static blurred effects


380
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:02,216
that look the same as what
we do across the system.


381
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,516
So, how do you do that?


382
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:05,566
The first thing you'll need


383
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:09,476
to do is call UIGraphicsBegin
ImageContextWithOptions.


384
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:12,766
This will make a new empty
image context with the size


385
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:15,066
that you asked for to
start rendering into.


386
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,096
Then you'll take your view


387
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:19,476
and you call
drawViewHierarchyInRect.


388
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:21,826
That will render
your views contents


389
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,116
into that context
very, very quickly.


390
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,176
Once you've done that, we
can get a new image out of


391
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,166
that context for
future processing.


392
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:32,366
That's as easy as
calling UIGraphicsGetImage


393
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,666
FromCurrentImageContext.


394
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,226
Once we have that image out,
we're done with the context


395
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:40,276
so we can go ahead, go ahead and
end that, clean everything up.


396
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:43,236
And then the last
part is applying


397
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:44,706
that blur effect to our image.


398
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:48,936
You notice I'm calling apply
light effect in the code above.


399
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,776
This is a category on UIImage
that we're making available


400
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,796
through a sample project
called image effects as well


401
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,446
as in the sample code
from this session.


402
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,606
Please feel free to
bring that category


403
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:03,196
into your own applications and
use it to apply light, dark,


404
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,326
and very light effects
across your application.


405
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,846
And that's how you can
make blurs in your apps.


406
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:10,636
Next, let's talk about how
to customize the appearance


407
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,506
of your applications using
a number of different tools


408
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,616
and techniques that we
have available on iOS.


409
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:19,226
So let's say, I have this
incredibly exciting application


410
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,466
with three sliders in it.


411
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,946
Now, I really don't want you
to rush out and like copy


412
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:23,646
that on the App Store.


413
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:24,786
This is all mine by the way.


414
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,186
So, our sliders default
to a blue tint color.


415
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:31,236
But my designer said, "We
actually want a red tint color."


416
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,046
An easy way to do this that
we'd have it for a couple


417
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,486
of years now is using
the appearance proxies.


418
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,846
These are as easy as
calling appearance on some


419
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:42,716
of the UIKit controls and then
setting various properties


420
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,196
on them such as tint
color, and that means


421
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:46,976
that whenever I make a
new slider in my app,


422
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:49,496
it will automatically
inherit these appearance set


423
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,246
of attributes.


424
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,686
But what if my application
has a lot


425
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,916
of different types of controls?


426
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:56,406
I don't really want to have
to call appearance on all


427
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,876
of these different controls
across my entire application.


428
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,076
There's a new change in iOS
7 to the tintColor system


429
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,715
that makes this easy to
set a unified tint color


430
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:06,236
across your app.


431
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,165
When you call setTintColor
on say a window,


432
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,736
all of its subviews will
inherit that tint color


433
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,415
until something else lower


434
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,556
in the view hierarchy
overrides that.


435
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,616
So, if you like-- if
you would like your app


436
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:21,806
to have a standard tint color
of red across your entire app,


437
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,976
simply call setTintColor
on your window


438
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,906
and everything will inherit
that appearance, that attribute.


439
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,646
So, again, what do
these APIs look like?


440
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:33,986
The UIAppearance proxies
have been around since iOS 5


441
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,086
and you can call appearance
and appearanceWhenContainedIn.


442
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,646
AppearanceWhenContainedIn
allows you


443
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,346
to change your appearance based


444
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:45,836
on what your controls are
contained in, what kind of view.


445
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:49,156
We're changing tint color
and bar tint color in iOS 7


446
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:50,646
as I was just explaining


447
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:52,826
where tintColor will
impact things based


448
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:53,746
on your view hierarchy.


449
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:56,916
Bar tint colors appear--
it's not appearance,


450
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,266
its behavior has changed
a little bit on iOS 7


451
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,216
so that it's what you use
to specify the tint color


452
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,756
of an entire bar on iOS 7 rather
than tinting the contents of it.


453
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:08,926
So that's how you can use
tintColor and appearance


454
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,606
to make your apps have their
own unique look on iOS 7.


455
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,816
We've also made some
changes to UIImage on iOS 7.


456
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,266
We've added this new method
called imageWithRenderingMode.


457
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:21,246
And there's a few
rendering modes


458
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,076
that you can apply
to images on iOS 7.


459
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,686
You can put them in
rendering mode automatic.


460
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,796
This is what we'll give you by
default where we'll do our best


461
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,896
to decide how to
render the images based


462
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,046
on how you're using
them in your app.


463
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,546
We're also allowing you to
customize these behaviors


464
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:37,426
with rendering mode
always original


465
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,756
and rendering mode
always template.


466
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,506
Now, these names probably don't
have a lot of meaning to you,


467
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,346
so I think I'd like to show
you what that actually means.


468
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,606
This is my original
image of Carl.


469
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:48,766
Carl is my friend.


470
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,636
If we want to render
Carl into my application,


471
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,446
if I put it on rendering
mode always original,


472
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:56,486
it means that we'll
render it exactly


473
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:59,376
as the original image was given
to us in all of his pink glory.


474
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:02,766
But if I switched it over to
rendering mode always template,


475
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,946
we're only going to look at the
alpha channel of that image.


476
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,176
We'll ignore the red,
green, and blue channels.


477
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:12,296
We'll also take the tint color
of your application and apply it


478
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,356
to that template image.


479
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:16,886
So, if my application's tint
color is red, Carl becomes red.


480
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:20,686
Similarly, if my tint color
is blue, Carl becomes blue.


481
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,626
[laughter] The next thing
we'd like to talk about is how


482
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:27,396
to use resizable
images with cap insets.


483
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,046
In this example from
Siri on iOS 7,


484
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,446
I'd like to call your
attention to the movie ratings.


485
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,856
You notice, we say what
the rating of the movie is,


486
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,696
and we draw this nice white box


487
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:39,706
around the outside that's
very nicely fit to the text.


488
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:44,256
We create that with UIImage
resizableImageWithCapInsets.


489
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,786
In this example, I have
this very small image


490
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,436
for my designers where we have
these corners that we want


491
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,606
to keep the same shape
but we want to be able


492
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:57,526
to scale the image to be very
large or more medium size


493
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,106
without distorting the colors.


494
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:03,506
You do this by specifying your
cap insets for the left, bottom,


495
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:07,436
right, and top to be how far
into the image that you want it


496
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:08,506
to always stay the same.


497
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:12,276
And this is made even easier
using the new asset catalogs


498
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,016
in iOS or in Xcode 5.


499
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,286
So, where's is this
a win for you?


500
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:18,566
This is a big benefit
in your app


501
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:21,516
because you can use a single
asset to style buttons


502
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:24,596
of all types of different
sizes across your entire app.


503
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:27,306
It also is a big win
for localization.


504
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,926
So, as you have text in your
application and you have buttons


505
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,196
with different lengths
of strings,


506
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:35,156
the buttons will
automatically and cleanly resize


507
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,916
to fit whatever string
your localization team puts


508
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,686
into the app.


509
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,956
So, going back to the specs from
our designers, they've asked us


510
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,216
to use these custom buttons


511
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:46,816
across our application
using a resizable image


512
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,196
and they've also asked us to use
a tint color of puce in our app.


513
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,596
Jim, do you remember what
the value is for puce?


514
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,796
>> Uh, 204136153.


515
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:56,736
>> Make it so.


516
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:57,776
>> All right, cool.


517
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,576
So, let's show you
what it looks like now.


518
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,956
As you can see, we-- on
the first demo I had,


519
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:07,756
the buttons are already
in there.


520
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:08,816
So, they're still
already in there.


521
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:13,356
But now, they all have the tint
color that everyone so loves.


522
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,946
And then you know also the
navigation bar also has


523
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:16,506
tint color.


524
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,776
As we drill through the app,
everything that [inaudible]


525
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:20,226
to the tint color
already has it.


526
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,766
So, we changed one line of code


527
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:24,596
and our entire application
gets themed with its color.


528
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:29,096
And now, our designers actually
in our application wanted


529
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,496
to have backgrounds to
be blurred in some cases


530
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:35,466
and then not blurred in
other cases to give some--


531
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,786
just have a little bit
more polish to our app.


532
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,226
And you do that by
when you select one


533
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,506
of your favorite photos
in your application,


534
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,096
so let's go and choose that one.


535
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:46,796
And we go ahead and we'll
set that as our background.


536
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,116
And if you notice right now


537
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,816
that the segment it controls
also picked up the tint color.


538
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,336
And as I set the
background color,


539
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,416
if I set the background image,


540
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,226
the checkbox is also
a template image.


541
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,536
So it will also pick
up the tint color.


542
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,716
As we go back, now we see


543
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:06,036
that our background
has a nice tint effect


544
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:06,986
or a blurring effect to it.


545
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:07,396
Excuse me.


546
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,796
And as we back up all the
way to the main screen,


547
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:13,886
you'll see that the buttons
are actually getting blurred


548
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:14,316
as well.


549
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:18,136
So, let me show you how we
go about doing those effects.


550
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,386
As Brandon mentioned, we wanted


551
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,456
to set a default button
background for all


552
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:22,936
of our buttons


553
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:26,156
in our application unless
we had set a specific--


554
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,076
some specific blurred
background.


555
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:29,856
And so, we won't go
into this very much.


556
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:31,616
But this is the code
that actually does that.


557
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:35,836
We get our default button and
then we make resizable image


558
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:39,426
with cap insets and we set a
5 point cap inset on the top,


559
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,406
left, bottom, and right.


560
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,816
And to give you some reference,


561
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:46,446
this is actually the images
I'm using and it is very tiny.


562
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:48,026
It's an 11 by 11 pixel image.


563
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,126
And so, when we stretched that,


564
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:52,206
only the center pixels
actually get stretched.


565
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,966
And we set that using the
button, UIButton's appearance.


566
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,516
We set the background image
for the normal control state.


567
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:00,936
And now, all of our buttons


568
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:02,806
in our application
have the same look.


569
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,216
Now to do tint color with
our lovely puce color,


570
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:09,136
we just set the tint
color on the window


571
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:12,156
and we could have done this
on each individual view.


572
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,626
But then, if we needed to make
a change which designers tend


573
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,106
to do every once
in a while, we--


574
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:19,036
we'd have to go make
the change globally.


575
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,846
In this way, we just
make one change


576
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:23,016
and then we can tell them
it took several hours


577
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:23,966
and it took seconds.


578
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,086
Now, I'm moving on to getting
the blur for the buttons.


579
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,576
Our launch view controller
is the first view controller


580
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,676
that comes up when the
application is launched.


581
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,916
And our designers
wanted the background


582
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,306
to be the normal color but
they wanted the buttons


583
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:40,436
to blur the content
that was behind them.


584
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:44,376
And so, when this-- when this
View Controller comes up,


585
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:46,136
it gives-- there's a
method called update in--


586
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,036
one of my own methods
called update interface


587
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:49,626
and if we have updated
the button,


588
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,166
I have another convenience
method called applyBackground


589
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,716
ToButtonSourceBlurFromView.


590
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:57,266
And what this does is it
takes a button and a view


591
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,406
that you want to blur from.


592
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:01,456
And it basically just calls
drawViewHierarchyInRect


593
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:03,996
and makes the blur and applies
it to the button background.


594
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:09,426
And this is the bulk of the
work happens right here.


595
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,206
As Brandon mentioned, we have
to start an image context


596
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,856
with UIGraphicsBegin
ImageContextWithOptions,


597
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:17,256
and we set that to
the size of the button


598
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,716
because that's what
the size we need.


599
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:22,406
But we also need to know the
buttons' coordinates inside the


600
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:25,076
background views
coordinate space and we need


601
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:27,136
that because you need
to position the view


602
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,136
so that it draws
correctly into the context.


603
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:32,586
If you didn't actually
reposition the view, would it--


604
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,826
they both draw at 0,
0 inside the context.


605
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,006
So, what you need to
do is in this case,


606
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:39,856
we need to offset the left and
going to go offset to the--


607
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:43,786
offset upwards so that the part
of the button that's hovering


608
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:47,756
over is what actually gets
drawn into the context.


609
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:49,866
Once that's done, we
call UIGraphicsGetImage


610
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:52,466
FromCurrentImageContext
to get an image out of it


611
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,896
and then we end the context.


612
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:57,596
And then this is where
the blur magic happens.


613
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,436
We're applying a light effect.


614
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,776
And like Brandon mentioned,
this is going to be


615
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:03,646
in this sample code as well


616
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:06,956
as another sample code that's
already on the developer sight.


617
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:08,456
It's a fantastic amount of math.


618
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:10,536
It's fun to go look at
but it really doesn't--


619
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,926
it's not all that
interesting care.


620
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:14,376
But I encourage you to all
go look at how it's done.


621
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:17,066
But once we have that
image, that's not blurred,


622
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,786
we set it as our
button's background image


623
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:21,096
and that's how you
get blur in iOS 7.


624
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:22,726
>> It's looking great, Jim.


625
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:26,336
Would you like to get started on
that kind of flipbook animation


626
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:27,996
that our designers put
to the spec together for?


627
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,306
>> Yeah, I should
get started on that.


628
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:30,876
>> I think UIDynamics
would be the way to go.


629
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,396
So, let's start talking
about UIKit Dynamics.


630
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,456
So, how can we make realistic
motion in your application?


631
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,026
There's two parts of this
we'd like to talk about today.


632
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:42,826
UIKit Dynamics as well as
the new motion effects APIs.


633
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,826
Let's get started with Dynamics.


634
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:49,656
The UIKit Dynamic system was
introduced in iOS 7 as a system


635
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:52,636
that lets you mimic real
world physical behaviors


636
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,236
in your application
and we backed UIKit


637
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:57,356
with a physics engine to
help make that possible.


638
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:01,426
Now, you can do a lot of really
cool things with UIKit Dynamics.


639
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,986
You can do a lot of crazy
things with UIKit Dynamics.


640
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,946
They best advice I'd
like to offer you


641
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:08,056
with Dynamics is
it's really effective


642
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:09,576
when you use it in moderation.


643
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:13,196
It's really easy to go overboard
with it and it's really easy,


644
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,266
you'll find, to have a small
value make a big change


645
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:16,686
in your app.


646
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,026
To help you make dynamics
possible in your app,


647
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,046
we've brought along a number


648
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:25,096
of really straightforward
behaviors that you can use.


649
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,126
So, we've introduced
concepts like gravity.


650
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:32,386
We've introduced
concepts like collisions


651
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:34,256
where things will
bounce off of each other.


652
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:39,406
We've added pushes where you
can do both instantaneous pushes


653
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:41,296
which give a shove in
the direction as well


654
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:44,186
as a continuous push that always
exerts a push in one direction.


655
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:48,276
We've added snapping behavior
where you can have things snap


656
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,106
to certain points
in a very nice way.


657
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:55,166
And finally, we have attachments
where things will be touched


658
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,646
to a point and will
kind of maintain


659
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:57,946
that distance in
that attachment.


660
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:00,276
So, what do you need to do


661
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,426
to introduce dynamics
in your applications?


662
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:06,386
It's not that difficult
to get started.


663
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:10,256
The first thing you'll want to
do is create a dynamic allocator


664
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,296
and you give it a reference
view that you're going


665
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,056
to be doing your
dynamics effect in.


666
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:18,046
After that, you need to
create a number of behaviors


667
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:21,206
that define what the dynamics
engine should be doing.


668
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:22,416
In this case, we're going


669
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,206
to just make a simple
gravity behavior.


670
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:27,006
And you notice, we give it
an array of items that we


671
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:28,476
like that behavior to apply to.


672
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:31,956
By default, we're making
all views opt into dynamics


673
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:34,566
so you can add your views
into that list of items.


674
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,706
You can also by default
have items


675
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,936
in your collection views
animate with Dynamics.


676
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:42,916
You can also implement this
protocol on your own classes


677
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:45,106
if you'd like to make your
own very unique things


678
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:46,966
that are opting into dynamics.


679
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:51,056
Once we've created a behavior,
we can add it to our animator


680
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:52,286
to put it in the scene.


681
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:54,316
Everything that's
attached to our animators,


682
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:56,296
all those behaviors
are going to be running


683
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:58,306
and impacting your
application right away.


684
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,316
>> Hey, Brandon, instead
of talking about Dynamics


685
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,976
on slides anymore, how about
I just them what it looks


686
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:04,816
like on the device?


687
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:05,966
>> That'd make a lot of sense.


688
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:06,456
Go for it.


689
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:07,586
>> So, we're going
to use dynamics


690
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,886
in two different
places on our apps.


691
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:11,436
Obviously, the first one is
net that [inaudible] effect


692
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:13,876
which I've got it working
a little bit better.


693
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,266
So, let's go pick a photo that
isn't really all that good.


694
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,246
There is a photo of
a taxi that can go.


695
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,236
And then what you can see now
is as the shred line goes up,


696
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:25,646
each individual one of those
boxes gets a little bit


697
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:27,536
of a dynamic effect added to it.


698
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:29,366
We can go delete
another one to see it.


699
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,996
So, the animation that was
happening before is still


700
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:33,946
exactly the same.


701
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,026
But now, as that scanline
goes up and it hits a row,


702
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:39,146
each one of the boxes
on that row gets added


703
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,376
to a gravity behavior.


704
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,216
And then, each one of
those also gets a push


705
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:45,346
in a general random
upwards direction


706
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:47,606
of some minor amount
of magnitude.


707
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:48,656
And that gives them the effect


708
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,166
that they're being
popped off like that.


709
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:53,216
It looks like the line
is burning through them


710
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:54,096
and tearing them apart.


711
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,866
So, it's getting pretty close
to what the designers want.


712
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,356
They may want to iterate
on that a little bit.


713
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:01,306
But the other place
that we really wanted


714
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,376
to use Dynamics was in our
flipbook in how we show photos


715
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:07,286
that we've taken during
the run to our users.


716
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,596
I mean, you can go through and
swipe but this thing is going


717
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:11,076
to take a picture
every three seconds.


718
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:13,006
So, you're going to swipe
through thousands of photos.


719
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:14,746
Not very interesting.


720
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,966
So, instead, what we're
going to do is we're going


721
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:17,916
to make a flipbook effect.


722
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:20,756
And what this is actually
doing is it's just iterating


723
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:23,226
through every photo that you
took while you were walking


724
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:23,866
around the campus.


725
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:27,456
Surprising a little code
make this happen as far


726
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,686
as Dynamics is concerned.


727
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:31,236
What's actually happening is
in the upper left hand corner,


728
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,036
we basically placed
a view on the screen


729
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:36,276
and through some CAAnimation
or view-- a UIViewAnimation,


730
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,686
we just set the alpha
and the transform.


731
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,936
And then we give a little bit
of a shove, instantaneous push


732
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,926
so that it will land in the
light pole in the middle.


733
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:46,526
And that light pole
is a boundary that--


734
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:49,016
it's provided by UICollision.


735
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:52,626
And then, because things on
our simulation are bouncy,


736
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:55,206
it bounces off and in the
second part of that bounce,


737
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:59,366
there is some more animation
to shrink the view down


738
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:00,976
and animate its alpha
out to zero.


739
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,376
Now, this is all fine
and good and everything


740
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:06,096
but Dynamics really,
we want you guys


741
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:10,076
to make your applications
more immersive with Dynamics.


742
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,676
We don't want you just
make things jiggle


743
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,556
and bounce and fly around.


744
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:17,386
So, Dynamics are really
meant to be interactive.


745
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:19,206
So, while this is running,
if someone was like saying,


746
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,756
well that's a really cool tree,
you should be able to grab it


747
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,646
and pull out photos and make--
so that the user can look at it


748
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:27,096
and say, "Well, it's a
really nice minivan."


749
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:28,106
I know, geez.


750
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:29,226
There's another one.


751
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,666
But, you get the idea.


752
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,426
The simulation never stopped.


753
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:34,596
You just added new
behaviors to it.


754
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:37,556
So, while this thing is
running, you can do all sorts


755
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:40,896
of different interesting
and unique behaviors just


756
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,246
by changing what the
animator is doing.


757
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:44,966
So, let's go-- take a look


758
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,256
at what this flipbook
looks like in code.


759
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,516
So, we have a flipbook
View Controller


760
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,086
that represents what I
just showed on screen.


761
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:54,366
And in our viewDidLoad, we're
going to create an animator


762
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,226
and [inaudible] the
reference view


763
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,316
of our view controllers
content view.


764
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:01,046
And then we create a
simple gravity behavior


765
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:03,196
and we give it a little bit more
gravity 'cause I want things


766
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:04,806
to fall quicker.


767
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,776
And then we create a
collision behavior,


768
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,606
and there's two reasons
to create this.


769
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:12,196
One, we needed that boundary
in the light pole so it--


770
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:14,926
the view or the image could
bounce off of something.


771
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:17,706
But we also need to know
when it bounced off of it.


772
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:21,756
And UICollisionBehavior
will actually tell you


773
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:25,186
that through one of
its delegate methods.


774
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:30,146
Second, we needed more
springiness in our simulation.


775
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,036
By default, normal thing--


776
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:35,506
everything in UIDynamics
has an elasticity of zero.


777
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,066
So it means it's not
really bouncy at all.


778
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:42,416
And so, to affect this, the
Dynamics, you create an instance


779
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,126
of UIDynamic item behavior.


780
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,776
And in this way, you can
actually change the properties


781
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:49,726
of any individual item or
a whole collection of items


782
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:53,446
in your simulation by changing
the properties on this behavior.


783
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:56,766
So, in this case, we set the
elasticity all the way up to one


784
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:58,386
and then we add all three


785
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:00,076
of those behaviors
directly to our animator.


786
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:07,226
Then, as we iterate through
the photos, there's a bunch


787
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,316
of code here that gets the
photo and places it on screen


788
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:10,546
which isn't terribly
interesting.


789
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:12,826
This is the push.


790
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:16,606
We instantiate the push
behavior with our--


791
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,596
with the view that
represents our image.


792
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:20,936
We make the mode instantaneous


793
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:22,286
so it doesn't continue
to push it.


794
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:26,176
And then, we just basically push
it to the left a little bit.


795
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:28,356
That is all the momentum
we're actually pushing


796
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:29,006
on to that view.


797
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,316
Everything else happens
from this initial push.


798
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:33,916
And finally, we add
that container,


799
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,356
that image to the other
behaviors that are already


800
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:37,316
in play in the animator.


801
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:42,516
Now, down here is
the delegate method


802
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:43,586
from our CollisionBehavior.


803
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,496
CollisionBehavior
endedContextFor


804
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,936
ItemWithBoundaryIdentifier.


805
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,536
I love our names sometimes.


806
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,756
This is important for us
because of two things.


807
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,566
One, we needed to place that
view that you guys are focusing


808
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:56,826
on so that the images don't look


809
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:58,516
like they're just bouncing
all over the place.


810
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:02,326
And two, we needed to
complete the second part


811
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:06,046
of our animation, the
fading out of the view


812
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:08,286
and of the-- in the scale of it.


813
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:12,126
You also noticed that
in the views animation--


814
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:14,176
the view animations
completion block, we're going


815
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,136
and removing the item
from all the behaviors


816
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:18,576
that it was attached to before
we remove it from the superview.


817
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:20,366
And this is important to note


818
00:33:20,736 --> 00:33:23,906
because while your
views can be off-screen


819
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,726
and still being processed
by Dynamics,


820
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,356
if they're not actually
imparting anything in your scene


821
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:32,616
or they're not having any kind
of effect on what the user sees,


822
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:35,356
it's in your best interest
to remove those views


823
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:37,296
and those behaviors
from the animation.


824
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:40,696
Otherwise, a view you can
imagine that's falling forever,


825
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:43,096
the system has to track
that and more tracking


826
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:44,786
of more space means more memory.


827
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:49,376
So, when a view no longer is
needed, go ahead and remove it


828
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:50,876
from the behavior
and the behaviors


829
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:53,156
from the animation
and all is good.


830
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:57,106
And one final thing I want to
point out with the grabbing


831
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:00,296
of the view, that was done
with no animation at all.


832
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,666
That was all just an
attachment behavior and gravity.


833
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:09,656
So, how do we know to remove
that behavior and the view


834
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:12,076
from the screen if there's
no completion block.


835
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,876
Well, we're going to use another
dynamic item behavior here


836
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:17,326
and I called it off-screen
behavior,


837
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,076
and it's not actually
going to impart any kind


838
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:22,696
of behavioral changes
on the scene.


839
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,956
What it's going to do
is it's simply going


840
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:28,516
to call its action block, and
the action block is something


841
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,706
that we call every time
the scene is updated.


842
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:35,196
This block is a way that you
can interact with your scene


843
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:38,696
for this behavior or for any
other part of the simulation.


844
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:42,436
And so, in this case,
as the view is dropping,


845
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:42,966
we check to see


846
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,786
if our containers frame
has falling outside


847
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:46,946
of the windows bounds, and
when that actually happens,


848
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,585
we know that we're
no longer on screen


849
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:51,116
and we can actually remove
all of our container view,


850
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:54,446
the following container
view from the behavior,


851
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:55,936
from the gravity behavior.


852
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:58,896
We can move our own off-screen
behavior from the animator


853
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,476
and then we can remove the
container from the superview.


854
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:03,476
Pretty cool, huh?


855
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,506
>> That's looking really cool.


856
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:06,166
I'm really digging
the flipbook animation


857
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,026
that you have going on there.


858
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:07,396
>> Thanks.


859
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:09,586
>> The next thing
we'd like to talk


860
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:12,026
about is how we can
create motion effects


861
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,026
in your applications.


862
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:15,336
Now, one of my favorite
things that we added


863
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:18,056
in iOS 7 is the sense
of parallax


864
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:20,566
where you can see how icons
move around on the home screen,


865
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,756
alert views float
above other views.


866
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:25,416
It's a really cool way
that we use to show--


867
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,936
give users the sense of
depth in your applications


868
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:29,386
and across the entire system.


869
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:32,376
So, as a reminder, this
is what that looks like.


870
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,656
We have an alert view
floating above some tabs


871
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,476
in that really cool
new Safari tab view.


872
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,806
And if you pay attention
to the top and bottom


873
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,316
of the alert view, as the
screen tilts up and down,


874
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,376
you notice how you can actually
see behind the alert view.


875
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:45,636
It really gives you a sense


876
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:48,866
that it's actually a layer
that's floating above the tabs.


877
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,356
These are made possible
using UIMotionEffect.


878
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:56,046
This is the API that you all
can use to create effects just


879
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:59,396
like you see on the home screen
or action sheets, alert views


880
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,626
and so on and across
the entire system.


881
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:05,646
Now you can think of these
similarly to CAAnimations.


882
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:08,176
CAAnimation takes
time as an input.


883
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,496
UIMotionEffects take
device motion as an input.


884
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:15,016
We've done a ton of work to
optimize these behind the scenes


885
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,066
to have a very minimal
impact on the user's battery.


886
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,246
So we would really
encourage you to take the time


887
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,716
to use UIMotionEffects
rather than trying


888
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:23,866
to roll your own system.


889
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,096
So to help you understand
how motion effects work,


890
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:29,726
you really need to
understand what the inputs are


891
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,676
to device motion.


892
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,606
So as you tilt your
phone to the right,


893
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:34,456
you're getting a
positive 1 effect.


894
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:37,126
As you tilt it to the
left, a negative 1 effect.


895
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:39,766
As you tilt it down,
you get a positive 1.


896
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:42,326
And tilting up, you get
a negative 1 effect.


897
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:43,846
Make sense?


898
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,416
Let's do it again
just to make sure.


899
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:49,756
So again as you tilt
right you get plus 1,


900
00:36:50,036 --> 00:36:51,926
tilting left gives
you a negative value.


901
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:53,856
Tilting down gives you a plus 1.


902
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,076
Tilting up gives you
a negative value.


903
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,876
And what you're looking at there
is how your thumb is actually


904
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,176
hovering above the screen


905
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,096
and how you actually
see different parts


906
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:05,026
of the screen behind your
thumb as you tilt the device.


907
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:07,586
To help make this easier
in your application,


908
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:10,496
we've provided
UIInterpolatingMotionEffect.


909
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:13,416
This is something that we're
providing as part of UIKit


910
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:16,886
that makes it easy to adopt the
motion effects in your apps.


911
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,456
It's very easy for you to use
interpolating motion effects


912
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:23,606
to interpolate between the
minimum and the maximum value


913
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,686
that you define when you
create the motion effect.


914
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:29,206
You know, what we apply
the animations to is


915
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,546
to a key path that you provide.


916
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:33,306
We can apply motion
effects to anything


917
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:35,596
that is animatable by CA.


918
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:38,676
The interpolating
motion effect is going


919
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:41,676
to automatically update
based on the device motion


920
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,346
as your users interact
with the screen.


921
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,456
And all you need to do to
make this work is attach them


922
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,736
to a UIView anywhere in
your-- outside your app,


923
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:51,046
and we'll start applying
motion effects to it.


924
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:52,636
It's really that simple.


925
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:55,576
If you want to do some
more advanced things,


926
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:58,176
there's a couple other bits
of API for motion effect.


927
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,636
The first is UIMotionEffect
group.


928
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,626
You want to group every motion
effect that you want to attach


929
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,966
to a view into a single
motion effect group


930
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,306
so that we can evaluate
them simultaneously.


931
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:10,936
Now you're probably
already thinking


932
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:12,256
of these really cool ways


933
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,786
to take advantage
of motion effects.


934
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:16,556
And some of you are probably
thinking, "Well, that's great


935
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:18,736
but I want more than just
a simple interpolation."


936
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:21,996
Luckily we have a solution for
you, and that's the ability


937
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:23,616
to create your own
motion effects.


938
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,366
The method that you need
to implement is keypads


939
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:28,316
and relative values
for viewer offset.


940
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:30,836
The viewer offset
that we call you


941
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:33,256
with is what we're just
playing with with our phones,


942
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:36,036
that plus 1 to minus
1 on each axis.


943
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:38,906
You return back to
us a dictionary


944
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,576
with keypads and
relative values.


945
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,126
Those keypads are the set of
pads that you want your effects


946
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:48,326
to be applied to and the
relative values are what you


947
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,106
actually want that value to
be as the name would suggest.


948
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:54,416
This allows you to do a number
of incredibly cool things


949
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,606
with motion effects
in your applications.


950
00:38:57,606 --> 00:38:59,286
So, what we want to
do with motion effects


951
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,406
in our app are a couple
of interesting things.


952
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,576
The first thing our
designers want us


953
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:06,056
to do is apply some motion
effects to the buttons


954
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:08,836
on our home screen to give
them a sense of depth of rising


955
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:10,156
above that background view.


956
00:39:10,576 --> 00:39:11,986
It's the same thing that you see


957
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:14,146
on the home screen
of your iOS devices.


958
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:17,026
They also put that lens
flare into our effect


959
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,176
because everyone loves
JJ Abrams lens flares.


960
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,346
But we thought why don't I
go a little bit beyond that


961
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:24,486
and actually make
that lens flare come


962
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:25,636
to life in our application.


963
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:28,606
So, Jim, why don't we see
what we can do with that?


964
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:29,356
>> All right.


965
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:31,386
What I came up with is not
exactly what our develop--


966
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:34,086
our designers came up with
because that's clearly shopped


967
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:35,456
and I'm not going to be
able to do that, so--


968
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:37,966
But what we came up with
I think is a lot cooler.


969
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:40,556
So, you can see that
before I pick up the device


970
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:43,196
that we have I think
reasonable effects


971
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:44,366
in [inaudible] of a lens flare.


972
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,116
And so when I pick up the
device that you'll notice though


973
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:49,226
as I start moving the
device in the next motion,


974
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:51,476
not only do you see the buttons
move but you actually see


975
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,896
that the lens flare is
actually moving along


976
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:54,616
like a diagonal line.


977
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,386
And you can also, it's
kind of hard to tell


978
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:57,756
but if you move really far


979
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:02,456
that the colors become much more
subdued and much more brighter.


980
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:04,576
And then if I go in the
wide axis, the buttons move


981
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,796
and then the color actually
also changes on as well.


982
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:09,316
So as you actually move a little
bit, it's a little distracting


983
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,456
with the buttons, but the
lens flare effect is actually


984
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:11,906
pretty cool.


985
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,516
And this is all done
through UIMotionEffect,


986
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:16,846
and let me show you
what that looks like.


987
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,206
We'll start off with how we get


988
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:19,786
that altitude effect
on the buttons.


989
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,616
Now we're going to do this
in the same exact spot


990
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,006
where we had a blurred
red button.


991
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,576
So we're in our launch
view controller.


992
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:29,066
And so what we need to do is
we need to create two instances


993
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,956
of an
UIInterpolatingMotionEffect,


994
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:35,036
one for the x-axis and
one for the y-axis.


995
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:38,766
So we create one with a key path
of center.x and we set its type


996
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:43,796
to UIInterpolatingMotionEffect
TypeTiltAlongHorizontalAxis.


997
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:47,326
And we give it a minimum
and maximum relative value


998
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:48,436
of negative 10 and 10.


999
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:52,476
And what that means is that
wherever center.x is normally


1000
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:54,906
for that view, it won't
deviate more than 10 points


1001
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:56,456
in either direction
on the x-axis.


1002
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,646
And now, we-- and
we do the same thing


1003
00:40:58,646 --> 00:40:59,936
for the y-axis right below it.


1004
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:00,966
It's the exact same code.


1005
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:04,016
The only thing that's changed
is the key path is now center.y


1006
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,086
and the type is vertical access.


1007
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,256
And because we want
these to be evaluated


1008
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:12,256
at exactly the same time, we
create a motion effect group.


1009
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,696
We add both of those
motion effects


1010
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,366
and then we add that
to the button.


1011
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:20,236
So each button has its own
grouping of motion effects.


1012
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:23,246
And that's how each button
moves like it has some altitude


1013
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:24,646
above the view it's below.


1014
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:27,326
Now the LensFlare
is not something


1015
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:29,446
that was easily just done
through interpolation.


1016
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:32,016
But it wasn't terribly
difficult to get done.


1017
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:35,366
So we created a view
called lens flare view.


1018
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,336
And in its initialization
we have a thing,


1019
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:40,636
a method called
addFlareToEndpoint.


1020
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:43,446
And that's basically a nice way
of saying that I created a line


1021
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:46,666
from the top left and I
made it go down at an angle.


1022
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,766
And we create these
lens flare blob views


1023
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:52,426
that represent each
individual blob along that line.


1024
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:55,236
The next thing that we do
is we create a random color


1025
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:58,206
and we create an instance
of our custom subclass


1026
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:01,326
of UIMotionEvent called lens
flare color motion effect.


1027
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:03,316
And it's a pretty simple class.


1028
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:06,016
With the color, once
we initialized with it,


1029
00:42:06,016 --> 00:42:08,506
we pull out the components
that we're interested,


1030
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,496
the hue and the brightness.


1031
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:12,466
And then we implement key
paths and relative values


1032
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:15,666
for viewer offset because
we map a horizontal movement


1033
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,296
to brightness and we map our
vertical movement to the hue.


1034
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:21,326
And we do some exciting
math to get a--


1035
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:23,516
compute a new color value
based off the viewer offset.


1036
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:25,286
We create a new color


1037
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:30,196
and because our lens flare blobs
layers are actually CAShape


1038
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,966
layers, the key path
that we need


1039
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,696
to return is layer.fillColor


1040
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:36,086
and then we just give it the
new color that we created.


1041
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,396
And that's it, that's
how you can get the color


1042
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:40,376
to actually map to
move in on your device.


1043
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:43,906
Now, the motion is
even more simple.


1044
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,806
We need the instance of lens
flare diagonal motion effect


1045
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,006
which is also another
subclass of UIMotionEffect.


1046
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,736
And again we implement key paths


1047
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,496
and relative values
for viewer offset.


1048
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:56,396
And again we do some more math


1049
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:57,726
to basically interpolate
a value.


1050
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:02,456
But what instead of looking
at both x and y, we just cared


1051
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,196
about the horizontal
access-- axis, excuse me.


1052
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,616
And what we did was we
applied our computation to it


1053
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:12,696
but then we rotated that point,
and actually 45 degrees or so.


1054
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:15,596
And then from that,
we are actually able


1055
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:18,456
to get not only x movement
but y movement as well.


1056
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:23,946
And we simply send center.x
and center.y to that rotated x


1057
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:25,116
and rotated y on that view.


1058
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:28,276
And then that's how that, those
views move all along that line.


1059
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:31,586
It's a really neat effect and
it's important to really realize


1060
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:32,976
that motion effects are more


1061
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:34,976
than just moving things
around the device.


1062
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:37,016
>> That's looking great, Jim.


1063
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:39,476
I think motion effects are a
really cool way that we can use


1064
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:41,056
to make all of our
apps come alive


1065
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,826
within our customers' devices,


1066
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:44,626
make things really feel
interesting and engaging.


1067
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:44,936
>> Yeah.


1068
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:47,336
>> So let's go ahead and wrap
things up from today's talk.


1069
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:50,026
We've shown you a lot of really
cool stuff that you can use


1070
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,516
in your applications to make
things look great on iOS 7.


1071
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:56,366
If you want to customize
transitions in your application,


1072
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:58,576
you can do that using
the new UIViewController


1073
00:43:58,576 --> 00:43:59,786
transitioning systems.


1074
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:03,186
You can set your applications
wide appearance using tintColor


1075
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:06,086
as well as taking advantage
of the UIAppearance proxies


1076
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:08,076
that we introduced in iOS 5.


1077
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,436
Images are a great way to make
things look interesting as well,


1078
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:14,386
and the new template images
are a huge win for you


1079
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,806
in making things
look unique and get


1080
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:18,746
that custom unique
tint color in your apps


1081
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,996
across the entire
system in an easy way.


1082
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:24,246
UIKit Dynamics are a great
way to make things come alive


1083
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,036
and feel very realistic
and you can take advantage


1084
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:29,456
of motion effect to really
make your apps come alive


1085
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:32,056
in the user's hands while
they're using their device.


1086
00:44:32,326 --> 00:44:34,896
If you didn't make it to some
of these sessions earlier


1087
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,396
in the week, I would
highly encourage you


1088
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,356
to check out the videos.


1089
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:39,736
These are all some great
talks that explain how to go


1090
00:44:39,736 --> 00:44:41,666
into more depth in
some of these APIs.


1091
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,496
And if you have other questions,


1092
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:46,846
there's some great documentation
online and please e-mail Jake,


1093
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:48,976
he loves hearing from you
guys every single day.


1094
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:49,946
Thanks for attending WWDC.


1095
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:52,000ddle
