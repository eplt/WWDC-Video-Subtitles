00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:16,826
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,416
>> Good afternoon.


3
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:20,916
[applause] Thank you.


4
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,826
Welcome to What's New in Cocoa.


5
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:26,696
My name is Ali Ozer, I'm the
director Cocoa Frameworks


6
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:27,276
at Apple.


7
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,986
So, what are we going
to talk about today?


8
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,616
We're going to give you
a high level overview


9
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:38,876
of the updates we made to Cocoa
in Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9,


10
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,336
and we're going to give you
pointers to related sessions


11
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:45,756
and labs because we have
many sessions and labs.


12
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,696
Note that everything we're going
to talk about today is new,


13
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,986
so I'm not going to be
putting this new badge


14
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,516
on every single slide that
has new material on it,


15
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,896
pretty much most things are new.


16
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:57,886
And this is not a
complete reference


17
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,866
to all the things we've added.


18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,726
These are the highlights, we
have Heather file updates,


19
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:04,696
we have Release Notes,


20
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,496
and in many cases coming
soon we have documentation.


21
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,916
Please refer to those
for the complete story.


22
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,836
OK, first let's talk about Tags,


23
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:16,336
you saw the feature
yesterday in the Keynote.


24
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:20,286
Tags is a new feature
which enables users


25
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:23,596
to assign arbitrarily named
labels to their files.


26
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:26,856
And users can search
for their files


27
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:29,076
or group their files
using these Tags.


28
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:30,776
It's a pretty powerful feature.


29
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:32,186
Just to recap what
it looks like,


30
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:36,096
so here is some files
grouped by Tag for instance


31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,276
that you can see the tags
are shown along the side


32
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:41,626
and also under the file names.


33
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:44,346
You can search by
tag as shown here,


34
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:47,386
you type your search tags
there and you will be displayed


35
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,906
that files with those
tags will be displayed.


36
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,406
You can bring up a side bar
which lists the tags you have.


37
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,886
You can go ahead and use tags
in your iCloud open panel.


38
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,956
You can see the tags and their
iCloud documents as well.


39
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:04,476
You can go ahead and assign tags
to files as you're saving them


40
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,436
or you can go ahead
and change the tags


41
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:10,045
on files using this new
document popover that comes


42
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,126
out from the title bar.


43
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:13,666
So there are many ways for
users to interact with Tags.


44
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,636
Now, let's talk at-- look at
the APIs we've added for tags.


45
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,666
It's actually not too many APIs
here we don't need too many.


46
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:25,586
One is a new, NSURL resource
key, NSURL tag names key


47
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:28,996
and the value of this is
an NS array of NS strings.


48
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:32,806
You would use this API on
an NSURL, get resource value


49
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:36,466
for KeyError which of course
an API NSURL already has


50
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,106
to get the list of Tags
assigned to a given file,


51
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:43,656
and you would use the set
API to set tags on a file.


52
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:47,956
Now, as you saw earlier, we
also have support for Tags


53
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:51,256
in the safe panel and
it's actually automatic,


54
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,406
not just for NSDocument-based
applications


55
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,026
but also any application


56
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:59,996
that uses the safe panel will
get a TagsField as shown here.


57
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,796
Now, the safe panel
will show the TagsField,


58
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,936
it will allow the users
to edit those tags


59
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,676
and it will also
automatically apply those tags


60
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:10,076
to the saved file, so you don't
really have to do anything.


61
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:13,176
Now, there might be cases
where this doesn't work right


62
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,626
or there might be
cases where you want


63
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:15,876
to customize this behavior.


64
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,236
In those cases, we
do have an API.


65
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,356
You can explicitly indicate that
you want to show the TagsField


66
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,906
or you don't want to
show the TagsField.


67
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,696
And if you are showing the
TagsField, you can then go ahead


68
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:29,016
and get and set the list of tags


69
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:31,736
that the user has
specified on that file.


70
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:33,086
And then you would
apply them yourself


71
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,536
or do whatever else you
want to do with them.


72
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,966
Next thing I want to talk about
is Light Content Controls.


73
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,336
So, these are new controls,


74
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,666
variants of our controls
are Standard Aqua Controls


75
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:47,046
that are meant for Window
bodies or Document Content.


76
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:48,666
Here's some example.


77
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:52,606
This is the event inspector
in the Calendar application


78
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:55,476
and the buttons you see
here, down the side,


79
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,486
these are Light Content
Controls.


80
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,806
As you can see they're
somewhat lighter,


81
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,656
than standard Aqua
controls and they're meant


82
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:05,106
for that white lighter
colored background.


83
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:08,076
Here's another example, this
is the Contacts application,


84
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:10,936
and the buttons along the side
are light content controls.


85
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,246
Here's the Maps application.


86
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,315
Now, the buttons along the top
here are standard Aqua controls


87
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,666
because they're just
being displayed on top


88
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,466
of the standard Window
background.


89
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:23,076
But if you bring up a
popover in this application,


90
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,146
then the buttons you
see in the popover again


91
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:28,006
in that light background, these
are light contents controls.


92
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,466
So, how do you access these
light content controls?


93
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,646
Well, they're available through
a new API called NS Appearance.


94
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:39,116
This is a class that lets you
access alternate appearances


95
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,126
and it's got a bunch of
methods, the one I'm going


96
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,676
to show here is appearance name,


97
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,216
you just give it
an appearance name


98
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:48,026
and it fetches an
appearance for you.


99
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,466
And we have two appearances
to find;


100
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,156
Standard Aqua, and
Light Content.


101
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,826
Now, once you have
an appearance,


102
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,606
what do you do with it?


103
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,626
You would use this protocol
which is to find on View,


104
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,386
on NSView and NSWindow,


105
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,336
the appearance customization
protocol.


106
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,906
You can go ahead and the set
the appearance of that View


107
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:09,146
or Window, and all the UI
elements inside that View


108
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:12,186
of Window will now
inherit this appearance,


109
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,876
and start using the
appearance you've specified.


110
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:17,386
And since the UI element
can inherit its appearance


111
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,816
from its parent views
there's also another property,


112
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:21,766
a Read Only property
called Effective Appearance


113
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,696
which lets you tell what
appearance a UI element should


114
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:25,146
be using.


115
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,716
Now, you don't have to use codes
for this, you can also do this


116
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:32,256
in Xcode in the Attributes
Inspector


117
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:33,626
in Xcode interface builder.


118
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:40,216
So here for instance is the
Attributes Inspector for box.


119
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,836
You can do this for
container classes.


120
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:45,056
And at the bottom here, you
see the appearance setting.


121
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,446
It's now showing Aqua.


122
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,126
If you click on it
you can see that,


123
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:52,286
you can now specify light
content for that container


124
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,726
and as I said, all the elements


125
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,686
in there will now start
using this appearance.


126
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,826
Next thing I want to talk
about is NS StackView.


127
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:00,226
NS StackView is a
new class we've added


128
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,136
to AppKit in Mavericks.


129
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:05,046
It's a class which
manages stacks of views


130
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:07,056
and it uses Auto
Layout internally.


131
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,486
It lets you group the views


132
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,296
and we'll be seeing an
example of that shortly.


133
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:14,656
And it also will manage
the sizing of the views


134
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:17,856
and it will also drop Views, or
click Views, or tighten Views


135
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,646
as necessary as the
StackView size changes.


136
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,476
Let me give you a
little example.


137
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:27,316
This is the kind of view you
might build with NS StackView.


138
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:30,406
Here you have a group of
controls on the left side


139
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,996
and you have another control,
a slider on the other side.


140
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:36,916
As this view is made smaller,
the slider comes closer


141
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,666
to the other group and then the
slider starts getting smaller.


142
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:42,266
And then, the text field
starts getting smaller.


143
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:45,606
And eventually when there's no
more room and pressure's rising,


144
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:48,606
the button all the way at this
end is voted off the island


145
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,726
and then things start to
continue to get even smaller.


146
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,976
So, as you can see, StackView
they're not only used


147
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:57,876
to using Auto Layout, it's also
hiding and removing some Views


148
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,866
as needed and it will
also bring them back


149
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,616
when the StackView
is made larger.


150
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:04,726
So, in this way StackView is
using Auto Layout and building


151
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,576
on top of it, and you
yourself don't have to worry


152
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:09,446
about any creating those
constraints or managing them


153
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,926
which is, you know, not


154
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,366
that [inaudible] especially
once you're removing


155
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,636
and adding Views and so on.


156
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,786
Now, StackViews don't
have to be horizontal,


157
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,036
they can also be vertical.


158
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,736
Here's a kind of view you might
build with a vertical StackView,


159
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,626
this is an inspector
panel you might see


160
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,286
in drawing application.


161
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,466
As you expand the various
pieces, various elements up here


162
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,776
and you know, they will collapse
as well and that's the kind


163
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,746
of thing that's fairly simple
to build with a StackView.


164
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,766
The API of NS StackView
is purely straightforward,


165
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:42,586
you create one by giving it
some views, StackView with views


166
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:46,866
or you can choose to add Views
explicitly one at a time.


167
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:49,906
Here, you're specifying gravity
and the gravity is the grouping,


168
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:53,036
either one end, to the other end
or the middle of the StackView.


169
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,536
And there are other
properties on StackView


170
00:07:55,806 --> 00:08:00,026
that lets you specify properties
in Layouts such as the spacing,


171
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,856
the priority, what the clipping


172
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,656
and hugging priorities
are and so on.


173
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,566
There will be a more in-depth
coverage of NS StackView


174
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,856
in this talk which is tomorrow,


175
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,746
best practices for
Cocoa Animation.


176
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:16,336
This talk will also go into
various animation techniques


177
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,476
for Cocoa both old and new,
so it's a great to talk


178
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:21,946
to learn both about animation
and StackView and in fact


179
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,566
about animating StackViews
as well.


180
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,476
So, next I want to talk--


181
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,766
so just of having to
talk about Auto Layout,


182
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,006
let me just talk a bit
about Auto Layout as well.


183
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:33,046
In Auto Layout, we've made a
lot of performance improvements


184
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,086
and this is true in
general but especially


185
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:37,645
in view-based TableViews.


186
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:41,116
That's because constraints are
now attached to Views in a way


187
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,566
that as Views are removed
or added to the hierarchy,


188
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,856
they stick to the View.


189
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:47,416
In addition, we've
made the enumeration


190
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,416
of constraints a lot more
efficient and predictable,


191
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,546
so that you will see much
more predictable behavior in--


192
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,846
when dealing with Views that
have a lot of constraints.


193
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,376
So, that's something you should
notice in your applications.


194
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,016
In addition, we have
a new workflow to deal


195
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,516
with Auto Layout in Xcode.


196
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:07,746
In general, Xcode is a lot
more flexible and forgiving


197
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,946
about letting you do
Auto Layout in Xcode.


198
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,396
You can now delete constraints,


199
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,326
you can create ambiguous
structures, you can move Views


200
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:18,346
around et cetera and Xcode
won't throw a fit anymore.


201
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:20,856
So this is-- you
are more in control.


202
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,786
And you can see more about
this in tomorrow's session,


203
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,176
taking control of Auto
Layout in Xcode 5.


204
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,286
Next, I want to talk about
Responsive Scrolling,


205
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:33,266
and you saw a demo of this
yesterday at the Keynote,


206
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,576
in addition you saw it perhaps
at the State of the Union


207
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,026
in the afternoon as
well it's something


208
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,966
that we've worked a lot on


209
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:43,026
and it's you know
something we think is great.


210
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,496
The goal here is to
provide the users


211
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:48,406
with non-stuttering
fluid scrolling.


212
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:52,986
So let me just give you a review
of how scrolling works in 10.8.


213
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:56,236
So here it is a view and assume,


214
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,856
not the blue border there
is your divisible area


215
00:09:58,856 --> 00:09:59,646
of the ScrollView.


216
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,976
In 10.8, when the user
scrolls, they see this.


217
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:07,186
Now, really what's
happening under the covers is


218
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:10,736
that when the scroll
starts, divisible area


219
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:15,236
of the view is copied up
a blip, blip if you will.


220
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:18,806
And then the-- reveal the area
is drawn in by calling drawRect.


221
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,606
And then this happens again


222
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:22,416
for every little
slice that's visible.


223
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,476
And of course, the user
never see the black flash


224
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,076
because we actually copy
the bits up and then we fill


225
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:30,386
in that area without
flushing the Window


226
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,366
so that the user actually
doesn't see a flash.


227
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:37,716
But one thing you will notice is
that in a situation like this,


228
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,376
the scrolling performance
is really at the mercy


229
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:41,896
of the performance of drawRect.


230
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:44,766
If that drawRect
call just to fill


231
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,056
in that little strip
takes say, half a second,


232
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,116
scrolling all stutter,
really for half a second.


233
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,756
And actually more generally,
scrolling performance is


234
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,116
at the mercy of the main thread


235
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,626
because the drawRect is
happening on the main thread


236
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,146
and the main thread is
a pretty popular place.


237
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:00,866
There is the Run Loop there.


238
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,726
You know, things are happening.


239
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,866
All sorts of things
might be happening,


240
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,316
network activity,
who knows what?


241
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,476
So, even if drawRect wasn't
badly behaving there might be


242
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,446
other factors which cause the
whole scrolling experience


243
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:15,196
to stutter in certain
conditions.


244
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:16,816
So, what's the solution?


245
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:22,806
The solution is to dissociate
the scrolling from domain thread


246
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,906
as much as possible and
we've done two things


247
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:25,946
to help with this.


248
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,196
One, is to get scroll events
of a secondary thread.


249
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,236
Now, despite itself is good


250
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,366
because the main thread is
now longer fetching events.


251
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,866
However, it's not
good enough by itself


252
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,256
because if you get scroll
events on a secondary thread


253
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:41,326
and if you scroll the view


254
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,116
on the secondary thread there
still won't be any content


255
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:44,536
to show.


256
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,616
So, there will be white
flashes as the user scrolls,


257
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:50,516
clearly not, not ideal.


258
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,446
So the second part
of the solution is


259
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,696
to prepare Overdraw
regions ahead of time,


260
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,356
so that the scrolling
can happen smoothly.


261
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,906
And let me show how this works.


262
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,246
Here is our ScrollView again


263
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:04,856
and this time we have a visible
area, the area that user sees.


264
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:08,096
In addition, we have this
additionally drawn area


265
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,476
which we called the
Overdraw area


266
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,156
and that's not visible
at the moment.


267
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,816
So as the user scrolls this up,


268
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,576
notice that drawRect
doesn't need to be called


269
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:18,666
and the user maybe scrolls down
again no drawRect being called.


270
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:23,366
And-- but if the user scrolls
a bunch, then we might go ahead


271
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,786
and call drawRect to fill
in that Overdraw area.


272
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:28,956
And of course Overdraw area
is well exists on any edge


273
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,946
that the user can
scroll towards.


274
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:35,496
Now, this responsive
scrolling is actually automatic


275
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,276
so you don't-- in most cases
you don't have to do anything


276
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,036
and your app should
get this feature,


277
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:43,456
assuming they're linked
on 10.8 or newer SDK.


278
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:46,036
And there are also a
few other conditions.


279
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,936
Now, your application can
chose to explicitly opt in our


280
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,436
out by overwriting this method
and this is a purview method


281
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:56,416
because you might want
some ScrollViews to do this


282
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,896
and some ScrollViews not to is
com/public responsive scrolling


283
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,876
by overwriting and
returning yes you say


284
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,326
"I'm doing responsive
scrolling no matter what."


285
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:05,456
Or "No, I don't want


286
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,296
to do responsive
scrolling no matter what."


287
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:11,016
So there's a bunch more
APIs here and a lot more--


288
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:14,116
lot more stuff to
learn and we will cover


289
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:16,476
that in Optimizing
Drawing and Scrolling talk


290
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,576
with is tomorrow
afternoon at 3:15.


291
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:21,416
And the next, I want to talk
a bit about Export as PDF.


292
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,086
And we talked about
Export as PDF before


293
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:28,006
and maybe you've heard about
it in its using its other name


294
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:32,586
such as save as PDF, save to
PDF, export to PDF et cetera.


295
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:37,026
The idea here is to enable the
user to generate a PDF file


296
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,356
without going through
the print panel.


297
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,226
And in fact in general,
we'd like the UI


298
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:44,086
to separate PDF generation
from the print panel


299
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,626
and the whole printing
process as much as possible


300
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,566
from the point of
view of the user.


301
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,276
So, in 10.9 here is what happens
when you choose Export as PDF


302
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,046
in an application like TextEdit.


303
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,366
Here's my window.


304
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,326
You get a nice, simple
safe panel.


305
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,266
It does nothing to do with
printing just a safe field.


306
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:03,936
And you can go ahead and save.


307
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:04,756
That's it.


308
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:05,596
Your PDF is generated.


309
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,326
If you want to go ahead and set
some parameters the users want


310
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,976
to have some control
or what, what they get.


311
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,426
They can click the
Show Details button


312
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,556
and get a somewhat expanded
panel which has field


313
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,276
such as page, size
and orientation


314
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,996
if appropriate for
your application.


315
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,966
In addition, possibly
some additional views


316
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,106
that the application
is adding custom views.


317
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:29,446
And you know, we normally refer
to those as accessory view.


318
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:32,836
Now, we've added new APIs
and behaviors in 10.9


319
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:35,206
to make it lot easier
to do all this.


320
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,156
If you're NSDocument based
application there is a new


321
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,516
action method, save
document to PDF.


322
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,636
If you connect the
menu item to this,


323
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,056
that's pretty much
all you have to do


324
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,976
and you'll get the
experience I showed you.


325
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,826
Now, you might want to customize
though the PDF generation.


326
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,976
For instance maybe
during PDF generation,


327
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:57,356
you want to take a
different printing code path.


328
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,666
Not the one you would get
when the user print it.


329
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,626
In that case, you can
overwrite this method--


330
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,616
I'm sorry, I skipped the
PDF print operation method


331
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,536
and customized the
print operation.


332
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,176
Now, if you're a non
NSDocument-based application,


333
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,386
and it's also fairly easy


334
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:15,726
when you're generating your
Print operation, go ahead


335
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:19,176
and specify the job
disposition of Print Save job


336
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:22,456
but do not supply a URL,
what that will do is


337
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,786
that will cause the
save panel to be shown


338
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:27,876
and the user will be able to
specify file name as you saw.


339
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,246
There's a few other
ways to customize this.


340
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,766
One new class, one other
new class is NS PDF panel,


341
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,786
this gives you more panel over
the panel and the excess review.


342
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,556
For instance, let's
say you don't want


343
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:41,356
to export just one
PDF file but you want


344
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,476
to export the whole bunch
of related PDF files


345
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,736
and you just want the user
to choose one location.


346
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:49,946
With this, there's an option
that lets you choose a folder


347
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,656
to save the PDF files too.


348
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:55,076
And then there's this other
class NS PDF info that sets


349
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,316
and gets that basically
holds the user choices


350
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:57,936
that are being made.


351
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,876
Next thing I want to talk
about is Media Library Access.


352
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,316
So the media library is the
user's library of images,


353
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,246
music, videos and so on.


354
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,976
And they're managed by
applications such as iPhoto,


355
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,756
Aperture, iMovie, iTunes.


356
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:16,706
So, we have two sets of
APIs to make it easy for you


357
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,236
to access these media resources.


358
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:20,606
One of them is a very simple API


359
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,526
that just gives you
a non modal panel


360
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,626
that will appear in
your applications.


361
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:29,686
It's a new class of an app kit
called NS Media Library Browser


362
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,746
Controller and it's
fairly easy to use.


363
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,976
You would go ahead and
create the shared instance.


364
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:37,666
You would specify what kind of
what library you want to see


365
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,976
in this case image
so the photo library.


366
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,076
And then make the UI visible.


367
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,946
When you do this, you will
get the panel that looks


368
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,916
like this appearing
in your application.


369
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,896
As you can see, it's showing
you your iPhoto events just


370
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,146
to where the user is used to.


371
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:57,486
The user can go ahead and choose
or browse for individual images.


372
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:01,056
They can also go ahead and
browse through locations, faces,


373
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:04,766
et cetera just like it appears
in iPhoto, Aperture et cetera.


374
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,266
They can also go ahead and look
at the images in a list view


375
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,165
which gives them more
details about the images.


376
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:13,156
So, it's as fairly
simple, not customizable.


377
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,086
But you know, that only took two
or three lines of code to show.


378
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:19,496
The other API we have
gives you low-level access


379
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,886
to the user's library and
this comes in the form


380
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:24,516
of a new framework called
medialibrary.framework.


381
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:28,306
This library provides you
with an Objective-C data model


382
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,666
that represents all
of the user's media.


383
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:35,446
It's a read-only model so you
can only access the images


384
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,426
for showing in your app or
importing into your app.


385
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,886
It's also asynchronous
in the sense


386
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:42,026
that your application
doesn't have to be blocked


387
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,056
as you're rummaging
through library.


388
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:46,486
And just to give
you a quick overview


389
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,096
of what this framework
looks like,


390
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:49,766
there are four principal
classes,


391
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,276
ML MediaLibrary represents
the library.


392
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:56,066
ML MediaSource represents
the individual applications


393
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,676
or source of images.


394
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:01,146
ML MediaGroup represents
groups that make sense


395
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:07,056
within that source for
instance playlists or locations


396
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:10,056
or photo albums and so on.


397
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,056
And finally, ML MediaObject
represents individual


398
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:13,956
media objects.


399
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:17,636
This-- this class will
provide you with properties


400
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,546
of that object such
as the dimensions,


401
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,816
the length of the
movie, et cetera.


402
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,396
In addition, that will
also return to you a URL


403
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,246
which you can use to
access the media object even


404
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:27,616
in SandBox applications.


405
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:31,386
Next, I want to talk about
block-based sheet presentation.


406
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:36,376
As you know, blocks are a
feature we introduced in 10.6


407
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,666
and since then we've been
incrementally updating our APIs


408
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,346
to take advantage of blocks.


409
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:42,796
In one area where
we haven't done that


410
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,746
yet is generalized
sheet presentation.


411
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:48,366
In 10.8 and earlier, if you
want to present the sheet


412
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,216
in your application, here's
the code you would write.


413
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,936
You tell NS app to begin
a sheet you provide


414
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,346
which Window the sheet
should be attached to


415
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:59,266
and then you provide a call
back in the form of a selector.


416
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,226
And then you go ahead and
implement your selector.


417
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:04,086
And inside that selector,
inside that method,


418
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:06,506
you process whatever
the user chose.


419
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,096
So, you know it's pretty
powerful, pretty good stuff


420
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,636
but it does take a
few lines of code.


421
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:12,946
You know, not super convenient.


422
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,016
And in 10.9 here is
all you need to do.


423
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,466
You tell the parent
window to show the sheet


424
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,786
and then you execute the
code that should happen


425
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,886
when the sheet is dismissed.


426
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,616
So, that's really it.


427
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,046
So that's the code
you're writing here.


428
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:26,136
So it's much better.


429
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,516
Now, this thing has
few other advantages.


430
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,216
This approach has
few other advantages.


431
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:34,156
For one thing, this version will
automatically dismiss the sheet.


432
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,706
You don't have to call
order out anymore.


433
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:37,826
When that completion
block is done,


434
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,086
the sheet will be dismissed.


435
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,226
It will queue up multiple
sheets for presentation.


436
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,726
Although it's not, you know,
UI we generally recommend,


437
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,906
sometimes some subsystems
might want


438
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,336
to show sheets one
after another.


439
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:51,916
And you all want those sheets
to appear on top of another


440
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,146
which doesn't exactly
working all cases.


441
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:55,636
This one will actually
queue them


442
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,946
so as one sheet is dismissed,
the next one will appear.


443
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,746
Now, however, if you're
a subsystem and you want


444
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:05,566
that sheet of your stuff here
immediately for some reason,


445
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:08,276
there is a big and critical
sheet completion handler


446
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,836
which will get your
sheet to cut--


447
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:11,346
you know, cut through
the line and up here


448
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:11,976
on top of everything else.


449
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:15,566
Clearly this would only be
used for some serious errors,


450
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,596
emergencies, whatever.


451
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,326
But anyway yes you have
that API if needed.


452
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:23,216
One thing you saw yesterday at
the Keynote is our new support


453
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,596
for multiple monitors and I
mean, here we say full screen


454
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:27,466
for multi-monitors,


455
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:30,026
it's actually goes way
beyond full screen as well.


456
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,296
Let me just recap what
this feature looks like.


457
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:37,056
So, here we have a MacBook Pro
and a larger screen attached


458
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:40,886
to your MacBook Pro and as you
can see here both screens have a


459
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,096
Menu Bar that Safari
is running on this one


460
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:45,096
and iPhoto is running
on this one.


461
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:48,436
So that the MacBook
Pro screen is active


462
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:50,296
because it's got
an active Menu Bar


463
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,686
and that's the active
application.


464
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,496
If the user goes and
clicks on iPhoto,


465
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:57,866
the menu on the other screen
is now active and the menu


466
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,896
on the smaller screen is
now appearing inactive


467
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,796
so that's you have a one active
screen at any given time.


468
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,106
So the user can go ahead
and interact with iPhoto put


469
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:08,916
into full screen mode, go into
edit mode and in fact even put


470
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,886
into gorgeous full screen
editing mode like this,


471
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,086
fairly straightforward.


472
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:15,256
They can also go ahead
and do the same thing


473
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:17,666
on their other screen and put
Safari into full screen mode,


474
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,976
again all part of a
standard operation.


475
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,886
They can also go ahead and just
switch between different spaces


476
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:27,056
on any screen they want as far
as they can switch the maps


477
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,266
or they can switch the pages


478
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,386
or they can switch the
desktop screens and so on.


479
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:33,346
So it's very powerful,
very flexible environment


480
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:36,716
and this is all controlled
with really just one setting.


481
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:39,916
If you launch Preferences
and go to Mission Control,


482
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,456
the setting here displays


483
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:44,456
out separate spaces is what
controls all this new behavior.


484
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:46,746
Now, users can go turn them off


485
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:50,256
in which case they get back
the 10.8 behaviors that--


486
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:53,146
you know that we had in 10.8.


487
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:56,006
So this is a user choice


488
00:21:56,316 --> 00:22:01,746
and in this mode what happens
is each screen has its own set


489
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,626
of spaces as you saw.


490
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,886
Each screen has its
own Menu Bar as you saw


491
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,696
and Windows do not span screens
so Window will either to be


492
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,206
on one screen or the other
but not span screens.


493
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:16,066
Since this is a user choice
there's not much control your


494
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,866
application has over it
and there are no new APIs.


495
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,966
There's some changes
in behaviors however.


496
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,766
For instance NS screen main
screen method will now return


497
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:27,966
the active screen and
active screen being defined


498
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:31,416
as the screen with
the Menu Bar on it.


499
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,086
And resumed Windows and
resumed applications


500
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,846
so these are state-restored
Windows,


501
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,716
will return to their previous
locations wherever they might be


502
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:40,366
on all the user screens


503
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:43,906
and newly opened Windows will
prefer the active screen.


504
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,566
So we believe these
behaviors will be appropriate


505
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,756
for most applications.


506
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:50,346
If you get a chance, we'll pop


507
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,436
that second screen you're
carrying around in your bag


508
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:53,606
and try your applications.


509
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,336
And if you don't happen
to bring a second screen,


510
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:58,286
we do have some downstairs
in the labs and you can hook


511
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,766
up your portables
to those screens


512
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,386
and see how well your
applications work


513
00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:03,486
in full screen modes.


514
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:07,226
So next thing I want to
mention is we have an updated


515
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:07,966
system font.


516
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:12,086
So how many of you noticed that
we have an updated system font?


517
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,106
I'm not talking about my iOS 7,


518
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,696
OK a few if you have
noticed that's good.


519
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,626
So, yeah we do have a
new font for UI Elements


520
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:21,886
and it's actually not a
drastic change at all.


521
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:25,746
It's very similar to the font
we had before-- Lucida Grande.


522
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,726
It's optimized for
retina display


523
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,146
so they're just slight tweaks.


524
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,756
This font is-- it's-they're
slight tweaks


525
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:34,076
but they're really not
significant enough at all


526
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,846
where they will cause
rewrapping of text and so


527
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:39,246
on so we're pretty
certain that's the case.


528
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,776
This font is not
intended for general use.


529
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,526
This font is really just
a UI Optimized version


530
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:47,156
of Lucida Grande so any users
who are using Lucida Grande


531
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:48,166
in their documents and so


532
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,786
on will continue to
use Lucida Grande.


533
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:55,606
Now you're saying, "Hey, my
application is UI Elements.


534
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:56,806
How do I use this font?"


535
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:59,726
Well, it's pretty simple use it
the exact same way you've been


536
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:00,456dle
using before.


537
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:00,456
using before.


538
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:03,296
If you're calling NS
Font system font of size,


539
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,926
you will get this new
font now or in Xcode,


540
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:11,926
in the Attributes Inspector, if
you have selected system font


541
00:24:11,926 --> 00:24:15,426
which is by the way the default
in most cases and has been


542
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:19,206
for many years, the system
font here is the right one.


543
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:20,516
So if you're using this one,


544
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:21,956
you will be getting
the correct font.


545
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:24,746
So no worries, your applications
might already be using this font


546
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:26,136
properly in 10.9.


547
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:29,096
Now, if you ever
bring up a font panel


548
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:33,016
and to see this font
called Dot Lucida Grande UI,


549
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:35,596
just ignore it, it's not there.


550
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,546
We hope it will go away soon.


551
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,666
This is-- this might make an
appearance in a few places,


552
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,146
this is not even a final name


553
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:45,486
or we don't know how this
will land but ignore this.


554
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,656
Don't reference it by name.


555
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,826
Again just use the system
font of size method.


556
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:55,166
And I want to shift gears a bit
and talk a bit about App Nap


557
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:59,956
which you also heard about
yesterday in the Keynote


558
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,196
and also State of the Union.


559
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:05,156
So App Nap is a new system
feature in OS X Mavericks


560
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:10,096
where the system will throttle,
non for grand applications


561
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,736
that are not doing useful work.


562
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,986
So now some of you are wondering
what this throttle means.


563
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:18,316
Some of you are wondering
what this useful work means so


564
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,136
and not for grand apps like--


565
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:21,576
'cause they have to
maybe is the question,


566
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,276
but anyway so there are a
bunch of questions here.


567
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:24,116
What do all of these mean?


568
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:25,106
How's it going to do to my app?


569
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:26,466
And that's maybe the
biggest question.


570
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:29,556
So first let me define
what throttle means,


571
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:32,366
the biggest thing about
throttling apps is


572
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:36,316
that timers will be delayed
and they will be rate limited.


573
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:40,736
So once an app is decided
as not doing useful work,


574
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:43,496
it will be put into App
Nap mode and in this mode,


575
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:48,046
say the app has a timer to
set off to go in one second.


576
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:49,606
The timer might actually
not go off


577
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,046
for 10 seconds or
maybe even more.


578
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:54,556
Let's say an application
is that timer that's set


579
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,516
to go 60 times a second.


580
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,616
That timer will now start
going off every 10 seconds,


581
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,456
so you know it's really
going to be sleeping.


582
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,536
Another thing that
happens is apps


583
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:09,446
that are napping will have
lower I/O and CPU priorities.


584
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:11,456
So even when they're
executing code,


585
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,876
their overall throughput
will be somewhat reduced.


586
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:17,306
Now it's not a drastic reduction
but it will be reduced compared


587
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,186
to other applications, the
foreground applications


588
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,476
and not napping applications.


589
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:24,176
So the other question is, well
what does useful work mean?


590
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,416
Well so there are
some heuristics


591
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,766
to determine useful work because
as you might guess it's not easy


592
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:33,006
to tell an application that's
using a hundred percent CPU


593
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:34,336
and doing something useful


594
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:36,646
versus something that's
using hundred percent CPU


595
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:37,866
and not doing anything at all.


596
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:39,386
So here are our heuristics,


597
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:42,926
one is handling a user
event or an action method.


598
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,746
So, if we find ourselves
that were in action method


599
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,816
in the main thread,
that's clearly as a result


600
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:51,386
of the user having hit a button
or chosen some Menu items


601
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:53,126
so that's presumably
useful work.


602
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,626
Drawing visibly, if the app
is actually drawing something


603
00:26:56,626 --> 00:27:00,036
visibly while the user is seeing
that drawing so we really want


604
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:03,396
that drawing to continue
playing audio as well


605
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:05,856
and the disabling system sleep.


606
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:09,786
Now some of you might be aware,
we have this API previously


607
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:12,696
in fact power assertion API
where an application can say,


608
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:15,156
"I want to disable
system sleep."


609
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,386
This is where the system goes
to sleep after no activity.


610
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:21,146
Applications can disable that
and the reason they do that is


611
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,106
because they're doing some
long-running operations


612
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:27,316
such as exporting images or
doing something else long,


613
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,866
and then they don't want
the system to go to sleep.


614
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,456
So, we take that
as a hint to mean


615
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,886
that the app is doing useful
work and we disable App Nap


616
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,746
for the duration for
that application.


617
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,916
And finally we have some new
APIs that we'll talk about.


618
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:43,146
You can use APIs to declare
activity formally and then we--


619
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:46,256
of course say, "OK you're doing
useful work, useful activity,


620
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,346
we won't put you to sleep."


621
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,926
Now App Nap is automatically
applied to all applications.


622
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:53,256
In fact that's the
goal of App Nap.


623
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,676
You know, we know that
there are a lot of apps


624
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,596
out there probably enough of
yours but there are a bunch


625
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,866
of apps out there that
do misbehave sometimes


626
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:02,606
and they're sitting in the
background just chewing


627
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:05,426
through CPU-- you know maybe
well-intentioned purpose


628
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:08,906
but again they are still chewing
through CPU and we're going


629
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:12,516
to apply App Nap to all these
apps who haven't been updated


630
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:15,486
or who-- you know,
won't get updated maybe


631
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,616
for a few more months or years
or you know, the ones we want


632
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,646
to apply to all these apps
that's why we're applying--


633
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:21,406
you know, no opt-in required.


634
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:24,346
Apps will get App Nap however


635
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:26,976
if some applications
are misbehaving,


636
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:29,726
users can disable App
Nap for that application


637
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:33,206
by using the prevent
App Nap check box


638
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:36,616
in the File Info
Panel and Finder.


639
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,776
That will disable App Nap


640
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,586
for that version of
that application.


641
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:43,076
Note that this check
box will go away,


642
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:46,066
will vanish for applications
that are linked on 10.9


643
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:49,566
with the intent that when you
put up 10.9 linked versions


644
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:53,076
of your applications, they're
hopefully App Nap savvy


645
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:56,016
and users don't have to turn off
App Nap for those applications


646
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:57,586
so that's something
to look into.


647
00:28:58,026 --> 00:29:01,106
Now earlier I mentioned
activity APIs,


648
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,166
let me just give a
quick overview of those.


649
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:07,366
These APIs allow you to declare
the activities your application


650
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:07,966
is doing.


651
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,306
APIs are in process info.


652
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:13,066
Here's one of them.


653
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,546
Perform activity with options.


654
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:18,296
I'll talk about the options,
a recent string which is used


655
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:19,816
for debugging end the block


656
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,356
and this is the Activity
Block that's being executed.


657
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:25,146
Now if you can't represent
your activity as a block,


658
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,396
you can also call the
Begin and End methods


659
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:28,876
which are also on process info.


660
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,636
So let me talk a little
bit about those options,


661
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,406
those options that
you specify the kind


662
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:34,716
of activity that's happening.


663
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:38,716
One common one is NS
Activity user-initiated.


664
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:42,016
This is simply an activity where
the user wanted to do something.


665
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,896
They hit some button;
they chose some Menu item


666
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,386
so something is happening
clearly the app should finish


667
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,296
that even if app is
not in the foreground.


668
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,256
Another example is activity
user-initiated allowing


669
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:54,016
system sleep.


670
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:55,476
An example of this is


671
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:58,086
for instance an application
that's sitting there constantly


672
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,076
giving you stock price updates.


673
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,376
The user might have
initiated that.


674
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,886
However, such an application
typically would not prevent


675
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,396
system idle sleep because it's
an application that's just


676
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:08,976
giving their-- showing
some status update.


677
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:13,046
Another example is
activate the background.


678
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:14,216
That's the kind of activity


679
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:16,006
that the user did not
necessarily initiate


680
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:19,316
but it should still
continue but maybe some--


681
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,046
the system should still
be apply some heuristics


682
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,476
to lower power usage.


683
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,776
But however, it's
still is something


684
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:28,806
that the app should not go to
App Nap during this activity.


685
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:31,526
An example of this is for
instance indexing in Xcode


686
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:36,226
or thumbnail generation
in an app like Aperture.


687
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:38,686
These are not things that
the user directly initiates


688
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:41,056
but these are things that
are being done on behalf


689
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,866
of the user, so they
should really complete.


690
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:45,026
There are a bunch of more
activities and you can look


691
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:46,536
at header files to see
what they're about.


692
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,726
Now, app nap is something
that's applied


693
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:50,986
to non-foreground
apps automatically.


694
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,396
We also have some APIs that
let you control some of these,


695
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,566
some of these facilities
explicitly.


696
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,556
Timer tolerance APIs
are one of them.


697
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,816
So, NSTimer now is
property called tolerance


698
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:06,636
and that lets you specify the
amount of delay you're willing


699
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:07,916
to tolerate on the timer.


700
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:11,976
So, the timer can fire by
up to that much time later


701
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,486
than the time it specified for.


702
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,306
So, the benefits here are
that this allows the system


703
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,996
to synchronize timers
across the system


704
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:22,366
so they're firing
at the same time.


705
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:25,996
And this as you saw yesterday
during the Keynote increases the


706
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:30,356
amount of time that the CPU
is idle which in turn impacts,


707
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,016
improves battery life.


708
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,996
So, let me show you an example


709
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,276
of how timers work
with tolerance.


710
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,326
So, here is a very
simple timer called


711
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,326
without tolerance you're
creating at one time,


712
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,036
one shot timer to
fire in two seconds.


713
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:47,276
And here is our timeline,
the timer will fire there.


714
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:50,126
Now, note that despite
the flaming graphics,


715
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:51,256
timers don't really fire.


716
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:52,826
But anyway, so, it will--


717
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,546
the timer will kick-off
at 2 seconds.


718
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:57,066
Now, if you were to go ahead
and provide the tolerance


719
00:31:57,236 --> 00:32:00,656
of 1 second, then the
timer can fire anywhere


720
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,536
between 2 to 3 seconds.


721
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:06,726
And then if you're to go ahead
and create a repeating timer


722
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:10,256
with that 2-second time period
but a 1-second tolerance,


723
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,826
the first time you'll
fire is here,


724
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:16,006
the second time you'll
fire is from 4 to 5


725
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,876
and the third time,
6 to 7 and so on.


726
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,296
So as you noticed, the
timer isn't really drifting.


727
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:21,996
It's still firing
every 2 seconds.


728
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:25,496
However, the fire time might
be delayed by up to 1 second.


729
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,706
Another set of API's
we're giving you is the


730
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:29,366
occlusion APIs.


731
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,466
You can now tell whether
Windows are visible or not


732
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:35,576
and the advantage here is
by telling that a Window


733
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:38,236
that you're drawing something
into is not visible to the user.


734
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:41,436
You can actually stop doing
the work of drawing stuff


735
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:44,256
and maybe even stop doing some
other work that's supporting


736
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,006
that drawing work.


737
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:47,706
This API exist on NSWindow
and NSAapplication.


738
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:50,276
You can tell what the
occlusion state of a Window is.


739
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,486
And there also notifications
that tell you


740
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,566
when that occlusion
state to changes.


741
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,846
We do have a whole talk
dedicated to App Nap.


742
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,126
That's tomorrow morning
at 10:15,


743
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,336
"Improving Power
Efficiency with App Nap."


744
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,896
In addition we have a lab
right after that Cocoa


745
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:11,046
and Foundation Lab where you can
ask App Nap questions as well


746
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,306
as any other foundation or
Cocoa questions in fact.


747
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:15,366
And then we have one more talk.


748
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:16,676
We actually have a lot of talks


749
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:18,706
about battery life
and power and so on.


750
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,056
But one that you might
have missed this morning


751
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,946
at 11:30 is maximizing
battery life on OS X


752
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:27,466
which is a great overview of
this effort and it's given by,


753
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:30,256
it was given by Bud
Tribble, vice president


754
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:31,446
of Software Technology.


755
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:36,366
Bud was also one of the original
designers of Mac OS in fact.


756
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:37,936
So, if you haven't seen


757
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,746
that talk you might want
to catch it on video.


758
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,206
So the next thing I want to talk


759
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:43,186
about is another new
facility we've added


760
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:44,446
to foundation called
the progress,


761
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:45,786
supporting and cancellation.


762
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:50,216
This is a new facility for
reporting progress of work.


763
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:56,846
It also allows the progress
to be presented to the user


764
00:33:57,146 --> 00:34:00,906
and for the user to cancel
the work that's represented


765
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:01,846
by that progress.


766
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:05,966
And now, this facility
has got some aspects,


767
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:09,815
it's loosely coupled
meaning the subsystem


768
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,076
that is reporting
progress doesn't know


769
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:14,896
about the subsystems that might
be displaying that progress.


770
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,436
This facility is composable


771
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:19,786
across layers meaning
different layers


772
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:23,556
of software can be generating
progress in their own terms


773
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:26,136
and they might not even be aware
of other layers of the system.


774
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:29,126
For instance, the user
might say" Go ahead


775
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:32,636
and compress this
folder full of images."


776
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:37,446
So, at the top level we're
processing 42 images,


777
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:40,116
one image out of 42, two
images out of 42 et cetera.


778
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:43,746
But at the lower layer as each
image is being processed it's


779
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,156
running through a
Scanline so kind


780
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:47,606
of Scanline100 and
101 et cetera.


781
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:49,835
And each layer reports
progress in its own terms


782
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,386
but it's composed across layers.


783
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,516
And this is also across process.


784
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:59,556
One-- process the application
that's reporting progress might


785
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,096
be different than the
one that's observing it.


786
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,316
A great example of
this is Safari


787
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,306
which is downloading a file.


788
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:09,026
It's reporting progress of
that download but Finder


789
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,606
or Dock can be observing
that progress


790
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,566
and showing actually how much
of that download is finished.


791
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:17,146
And in fact that those
facilities do use NS Progress


792
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:18,236
in the system.


793
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:19,796
So let me give you
a quick example


794
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:21,286
of how you use NS Progress.


795
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:24,096
Here's a simple method
which does some work.


796
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:27,736
It runs through an array
of stuff just one by one


797
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,266
and it processes the items


798
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,896
in the array fairly
straightforward.


799
00:35:31,136 --> 00:35:32,826
If you want to make
this progress savvy,


800
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:34,946
you would insert these
two lines of code.


801
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,616
One of them goes and
creates an NS Progress object


802
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:41,636
and you specify a total unit
count for an array of elements,


803
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:44,236
the number of elements in an
array is a perfect unit account


804
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,276
for a file, the byte count


805
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:49,046
of the file might be the
unit count to use and so on.


806
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,706
And then each time through
the loop we go ahead


807
00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:53,296
and set the completed
unit count.


808
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:57,026
We increment the completed unit
count to indicate we're done


809
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,086
with one more item, so
fairly straightforward.


810
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:02,326
Now, you can also go to the next
step and make those cancelable.


811
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,636
To do that, you would
go ahead and say


812
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:08,396
if the progress is canceled then
you go ahead and exit the loop


813
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,446
with an appropriate
canceled error.


814
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,476
Of course, this would
also indicate


815
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:14,766
that you would tell the
progress that's cancelable


816
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:18,146
and that upper levels would
provide the ability for the user


817
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,326
to cancel the progress.


818
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,716
But you know, you can just
add this code here as a way


819
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,966
to say that, "hey, I know
about cancellation I'll deal


820
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:24,916
with it if the user did."


821
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:28,196
Observing progress is also
fairly straightforward.


822
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:32,436
There are properties
such as total unit count,


823
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:34,656
completed unit count,
fraction completed


824
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:36,816
that you can display in your UI.


825
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:39,376
There's also a localized
description that's generated


826
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:41,616
fairly generically or
it might be specialized


827
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,216
by whoever is generating
the progress.


828
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,906
In addition, there
are other properties


829
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:47,296
such as whether the
progress is in determinant


830
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,186
and of course whether
it's cancelable or not.


831
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,316
As I mentioned earlier,
an example of you know,


832
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:54,506
observing progress
is a finder window


833
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,486
where this file is being
either copied or downloaded


834
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:00,886
but the little bar at the
bottom is showing the progress


835
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,276
and the X in the corner there


836
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:03,936
in the upper left
corner is showing you


837
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,486
that it's a cancelable progress.


838
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:08,716
So the user can click it at any
point to stop the operation.


839
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:11,436
So the next thing I want to talk
about is date and time handling.


840
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:13,386
And this is a favorite
topic of ours


841
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:17,476
because I think we've talked
about this every WWDC for a few,


842
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,736
for the last few years now it's


843
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:21,546
because current calendar
computations turned


844
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:22,186
out to be hard.


845
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,976
They're hard because there
are different calendar systems


846
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,896
in use around the world.


847
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:27,836
They're hard because there
are daylight savings.


848
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:30,346
They're hard there because of
their time zones and so on.


849
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:32,256
So there are a lot of little
complications involved


850
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,506
in current calendar
computations.


851
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,336
So to help with this, we
provided a bunch more APIs.


852
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:38,846
And I'm just going to
touch upon a few of them.


853
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:42,416
Some of the APIs are
just what we would refer


854
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,956
to as communions APIs.


855
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:46,926
They just give you very
simple one-line ways


856
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:50,436
to achieve some things that
might have been few lines before


857
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,046
or maybe in fact
more lines in fact.


858
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:53,736
And there might have
been hidden pitfalls.


859
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,696
An example is just
asking a question


860
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,296
like "is date in today?"


861
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,316
Is this NSDate object
some time in today?


862
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:03,196
One-line call now to your
appropriate calendar.


863
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,726
Another one is this
date in the weekend.


864
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,596
That's you know that's not
getting fairly powerful


865
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:11,536
because you know definition of
weekend might change depending


866
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:14,036
on what calendar and what
part of the world you are.


867
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:18,266
Another call along the same
lines "is date equal to date"


868
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,286
in unit ground [inaudible]
in this case,


869
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:23,206
it will tell you whether two
dates are within the same month


870
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,816
in that calendar
system and so on.


871
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:28,426
There's a bunch of methods here
I would encourage you to go look


872
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:30,936
at the header file to
see what we've all added.


873
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,636
We also have a bunch of
new enumeration APIs here.


874
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:35,786
And again, I will just--


875
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:38,416
I want to go through them all
just show you one of them.


876
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,246
Enumerate dates starting
after date.


877
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:45,476
Now, this method here will
enumerate dates you are


878
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:47,756
providing a date
components instance


879
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:49,846
which represents your
enumeration parameters.


880
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:54,326
And then options parameter which
represents what to do in case


881
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:55,896
of various exceptional cases.


882
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:57,696
Let me give you a quick example.


883
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:01,916
Let's say you want to create
NSDate representing 2:30 a.m.


884
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:02,696
every day.


885
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:06,266
You'd create a date
components object set the hour


886
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,276
and the minute like
this to 2 and 30.


887
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,596
And then you would ask
your current calendar


888
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,526
which is usually the
most appropriate calendar


889
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:14,296
to enumerate.


890
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:15,726
So fairly straightforward


891
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:19,466
and you would start NSDate
date it's right now June 11th


892
00:39:19,466 --> 00:39:24,006
at 4 p.m. So, you start running
this program and it will report


893
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:27,096
to you June 12th at 2:30
a.m. so on and so forth.


894
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:30,596
March 8th 2:30 a.m.,
March 9th at 3 a.m.


895
00:39:30,596 --> 00:39:33,236
And it will continue
on reporting 2:30.


896
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:36,596
So what happened there on
March 9th, I think most


897
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:37,936
of you already can guess it's


898
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:39,976
when daylight savings
time happens here


899
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:40,996
in the United States.


900
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:43,436
So the algorithm chose
to give you 3 o'clock


901
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,746
but it also told you that
the time was not exact.


902
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:48,206
So you know that
something went wrong.


903
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,666
So where did the 3
o'clock come from?


904
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,086
Well, it came from
this argument here,


905
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,666
NSCalendar match next time.


906
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:58,356
This option tells you that if
this given time doesn't exist


907
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,246
and in this case of
course there's no 2:30


908
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:02,736
on March 9th time
jumps from 2 a.m.


909
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:03,826
to 3 a.m. just give
me the next time.


910
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:04,686
So it gives you 3 a.m.


911
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:10,246
There are other options which
give you other choices like 3:30


912
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:12,796
or 1:30 or maybe it doesn't
give you a return result at all


913
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,176
and just generates
an error instead.


914
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,956
So to find out more about the
various challenges and issues


915
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:22,196
and the various solutions we've
come up with, and to hear more


916
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,066
about these options in
this enumeration case.


917
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:26,856
You can go to this talk
on Friday at 11:30,


918
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,656
Solutions to Common Date
and Time Challenges.


919
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:30,656
You know, there are a lot


920
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:32,746
of hard things actually it
turns out in programing.


921
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,036
Another thing that's
hard is handling plurals.


922
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:39,066
Now, many of you might say,
"what's hard with that?,


923
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:44,376
I wrote this code" you know,
if N equals one, yes you know,


924
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:48,296
there is one and if otherwise
you know percent D files are


925
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:48,976
selected right?


926
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:51,336
So many of us are either
proud of within this--


927
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:53,296
having this code,
or maybe guilty


928
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:54,296
of having written this code?


929
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:57,466
So this code is actually fine
for English but it doesn't work


930
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,346
in other languages,
most other languages.


931
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:02,186
For instance, even French
turns out, treats zero


932
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:05,486
and one differently
than the plural cases.


933
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:07,926
While in English, zero is
treated like the plural case.


934
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:11,436
And forget about Arabic,
here's what you get,


935
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,046
you get six different cases and
I'm not even going to you know,


936
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,016
run through this code.


937
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,836
But it's not simple
and so if you are going


938
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:19,626
to write a properly
localized application


939
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:23,156
that handles all these cases,
there's a lot of if statements


940
00:41:23,156 --> 00:41:24,926
and a lot of localizations
we're having to deal with.


941
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,816
So, we have a solution
for this in foundation


942
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:32,606
and we call it localized
Populous File


943
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:36,576
and it was also known as
strings dict resource files.


944
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:39,506
Those of you familiar with the
way we do localization know


945
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:40,846
that we have strings file.


946
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:44,506
Strings dict files as you
can guess is just a glorified


947
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:46,876
strings file which actually
contains the full-fledged


948
00:41:46,926 --> 00:41:47,966
dictionary in there.


949
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:52,616
It provides localized
forms based on plurality


950
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:54,496
as I showed and also gender.


951
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,726
It turns out gender, most of
you know isn't easy either.


952
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,646
Some languages have
one, some have two,


953
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:01,376
turns out some have
even more like up


954
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,996
to five in some languages.


955
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,256
And you know, and who
knows what will happen


956
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,746
when you discover an
alien race with 10 sexes?


957
00:42:08,056 --> 00:42:09,736
So gender is not easy OK?


958
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:13,206
So anyway the good thing
here is there's no new API


959
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:14,046
to do any of this.


960
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:15,836
You just have in fact one
code of path, for instance,


961
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,146
here's a kind of
code you might write.


962
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,376
Just localize a string,
percent D files selected,


963
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:21,656
it's a nice generic string,


964
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:24,676
it'll work in case no
localization exist.


965
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,796
It's clearly suboptimal
but it will work.


966
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,066
However if this was
properly localized,


967
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,726
here is what the
localization would look like.


968
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:37,536
So let's look at a strings
file, the strings dict file.


969
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,756
First of all, avert your eyes


970
00:42:39,756 --> 00:42:41,146
because there are
a lot of XML here.


971
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,456
And XML, you know
is this ugly glass


972
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:46,016
that makes everything
look unattractive.


973
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:50,316
So let's hide all this stuff
and maybe just pull out the guts


974
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:51,436
of what we're trying to look at.


975
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:53,666
So the string we're
localizing is up here,


976
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,136
percent D file selected.


977
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,396
It's been localized
into this string.


978
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:01,946
File count selected and that
substring file count is actually


979
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,586
being selected out of
this dictionary here.


980
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:06,236
Either the substring if file is


981
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:08,616
or the substring
percent D files are based


982
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,786
on the number we
have is one or other.


983
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:12,936
This works for the English case


984
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:14,666
and this is the English
strings dict file.


985
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:18,276
However, if the same
situation was being localized


986
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:21,816
for other languages, there would
be other cases here such as zero


987
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:24,626
or two or few or many,
which would apply


988
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:26,616
to different localizations
and different languages.


989
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:30,296
So this is the way that we
handle localizations now if you,


990
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,516
and it's a manner
of just you know,


991
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:35,156
coming up with the
current localization files


992
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:36,926
which can be done of
course in parallel


993
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:38,086
to your application development.


994
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,606
So I'm going to talk a
bit about instance type.


995
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,456
Instance type is a
feature we introduced


996
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,496
in 10.8 in objective C.


997
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:46,026
Instance type indicates


998
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:48,936
that a method returns an
instance of its receiver.


999
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:50,726
And you might already
be familiar with it.


1000
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,086
It's already applied
implicitly to methods


1001
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:54,776
such as ELAC, NEW and INIT.


1002
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,846
Although these are not the
declarations you see in 10.8.


1003
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,646
SDKs, this is the way
it works implicitly.


1004
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:04,506
So this means that when you
send NSArray and ELAC method,


1005
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:08,126
the return now is
implicitly assumed


1006
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:09,526
to be an instance of NSArray.


1007
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:12,256
So this is applied only to
a very few methods in 10.8


1008
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:15,246
because many other methods
are not implicitly done.


1009
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:19,386
But in 10.9, we've declared this
on many more methods in a number


1010
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:23,446
of foundation classes including
NSString, NSDictinary, NSSet,


1011
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:28,586
NSDate etc. So let me just
show you how this helps you.


1012
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:34,286
Here is a line of code which
some people might have written


1013
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:36,796
at some point, probably
nobody in this room.


1014
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,006
And I'm just going
to put a big X on it


1015
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:42,316
because there's a giant
error in this line of code.


1016
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:44,036
And you know, you're saying


1017
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:48,166
of NSMutableSet mySet
equals NSMutableArray array.


1018
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:52,296
Now the thing is so, in 10.8,
the compiler says OK, whatever.


1019
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:54,706
It doesn't even generate
a warning.


1020
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:56,906
And that's because
the arraignment


1021
00:44:56,906 --> 00:45:00,026
to the 10.8 is declared to
return ID so the compiler think


1022
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:00,886
that it's a good match here.


1023
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:04,176
Now, what's even sadder
is that if you go ahead


1024
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:07,206
and write the next line
like this, mySet add object,


1025
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:10,746
this also works because add
objects happens to exist both


1026
00:45:10,746 --> 00:45:12,806
in NSMutableArray
and NSMutableSet.


1027
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:14,276
So now you've written a code


1028
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:17,036
which is totally not
doing what you intended.


1029
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:21,056
But it is working and the
bad thing is this will work


1030
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:23,966
with a number of
items like 5, 10, 20.


1031
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:26,066
But you know, as you add
more items to the array,


1032
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:28,056
instead of getting
set characteristics


1033
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:29,326
that you might have
been expecting,


1034
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,056
you will be getting
array characteristics.


1035
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:33,196
So your performance
will be suddenly showing


1036
00:45:33,746 --> 00:45:34,576
weird behaviors.


1037
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:39,996
So, the bottom-line in 10.8, the
compiler is happy, no complaints


1038
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:41,026
and the Apps seems to work.


1039
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:43,576
In 10.9, here's what
the compiler will do,


1040
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:44,816
it will give you a big warning,


1041
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:47,426
telling you yes,
something's wrong.


1042
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:49,886
You won't be clapping
actually once you complied your


1043
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:52,336
applications on 10.9
and get warnings.


1044
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:57,326
However, it's very important to
pay attention to these warnings


1045
00:45:57,326 --> 00:46:00,066
because we found out
many cases where we--


1046
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:01,686
we've gotten warnings
due to this,


1047
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:05,256
were actually either real bugs
or bugs waiting to happen.


1048
00:46:05,256 --> 00:46:07,126
So it's a good idea to pay
attention to these warnings.


1049
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:08,146
They are good for you.


1050
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,596
Now, speaking of NSArray, let's
talk about a tidbit in NSArray.


1051
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:17,066
For the longest time, we've had
a method called last object.


1052
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:21,816
And now, we've added a
method called first object.


1053
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:23,226
And because we love you so much,


1054
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:25,796
it actually works
back to 10.6 in iOS4.


1055
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,576
So we made that happen to you.


1056
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:30,236
We decided it was about time,
we were keeping it you know,


1057
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:31,946
it was just ripening
on the tree.


1058
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:32,606
So there it is.


1059
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:37,036
Another tidbit about NSData,
so NSData now has basics


1060
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:38,686
for encoding and
decoding support.


1061
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:41,026
You can encode/decode
back the strings and data.


1062
00:46:41,656 --> 00:46:42,096
Thank you.


1063
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:46,256
You can also cast the dispatch
data ts to NSData's now


1064
00:46:46,256 --> 00:46:50,076
and this is actually a one way--
one way bridging effectively.


1065
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:53,806
They're sometimes you-- you
know, you cross API boundaries


1066
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:55,856
and you need to do this.


1067
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:58,326
And note that since dispatch
data ts, those of you


1068
00:46:58,326 --> 00:46:59,356
who are familiar
might know this.


1069
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,426
Dispatch data ts can represent
discontiguous blocks of data.


1070
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,206
There's a slight, you know,


1071
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,776
maybe mismatch with
NSData there.


1072
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:12,106
If you call NSData, bytes method
will actually make it work.


1073
00:47:12,106 --> 00:47:13,756
However, if you want
to be more efficient


1074
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,616
with these continuos
blocks of data,


1075
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:18,286
you can actually use this new
enumeration method we've added


1076
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:21,426
which lets you enumerate NSData
in terms of the blocks it has.


1077
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,286
And of course, if you
happen to call this on one


1078
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:26,136
of the traditional style datas,
you'll still get just one block.


1079
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,146
It will be as efficient as
calling the bytes method.


1080
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:31,416
So it's you know, it's a pretty
good method to use in general.


1081
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:33,766
So just call enumerate
byte ranges using block


1082
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:35,686
and it will return to
you the radius where the,


1083
00:47:35,746 --> 00:47:37,856
the ranges where the
discontiguous memory


1084
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:38,716
blocks exist.


1085
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:43,236
OK, NSURL component is another
new class in foundation.


1086
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:47,476
NSURL components is to NSURL
what NSDate components is


1087
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:48,196
to NSDate.


1088
00:47:48,196 --> 00:47:52,016
It's a mutable class that lets
you parse and create URLs.


1089
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:54,646
And for those of you
who are into RFCs.


1090
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:59,156
This now allows NSURL to be
compliant with this RFC up here.


1091
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:01,896
The API is fairly
straightforward.


1092
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:03,706
You can initialize
one from a URL


1093
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,286
or you can just initialize
an empty one.


1094
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:08,036
You can go ahead and set
various properties on here


1095
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:10,746
such as the scheme, the
user, the path, the query.


1096
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:13,956
And you just go ahead
and extract the URL.


1097
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:17,436
And just to show you
a quick example, you--


1098
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,326
so let me create one just
specify those parameters


1099
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:22,216
and I can go ahead
and ask the URL


1100
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:23,266
and here's the output you get.


1101
00:48:23,346 --> 00:48:25,876
So it's much, much
more straightforward


1102
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:28,926
than using the previous
URLs and the APIs and NSURL.


1103
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,996
NSURLSession is another
API in foundation.


1104
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:34,406
It's actually a set
of related classes,


1105
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:37,316
it's replacement APIs
for NSURLConnection.


1106
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,526
It's-- gives you
improved control


1107
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:40,926
over configuration options


1108
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:43,376
such as authentication
cookies and caching.


1109
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:45,876
You no longer have to fiddle
with the global settings,


1110
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:48,596
you can just set them for the
operation you have at hand.


1111
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,676
It has ability to pour out
from out of process downloads


1112
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:54,136
and uploads and it will
notify you when it's done.


1113
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:57,496
And there's also some
convenience APIs in NSURLSession


1114
00:48:57,496 --> 00:49:00,616
that lets you do simple
cancelable asynchronous


1115
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:02,846
operations which has
a few lines of code.


1116
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:05,026
I'm not going to go
into more depth here


1117
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,106
because there's a talk
about NSURLSession,


1118
00:49:08,106 --> 00:49:09,836
what's new in foundation
networking.


1119
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:12,446
We have some improvements in
the core data and you heard


1120
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:14,166
about this yesterday as well.


1121
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:17,136
In the area of iCloud
support, we now made it


1122
00:49:17,136 --> 00:49:21,506
so that core data does lot more
of the tedious things for you.


1123
00:49:21,646 --> 00:49:24,876
For instance, core data will
now manage your fallback store.


1124
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,166
You don't have to
deal with it anymore.


1125
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:30,386
Core data will do asynchronous
iCloud initialization,


1126
00:49:30,736 --> 00:49:32,906
so you don't have to worry
about writing that code anymore.


1127
00:49:33,186 --> 00:49:36,156
And core data will also
automatically handle account


1128
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:36,906
changes for you.


1129
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:39,026
So that's another block of code
that you don't have to write


1130
00:49:39,086 --> 00:49:40,396
in your coded applications.


1131
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:43,846
In addition, there are
many other fixes not just


1132
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:46,066
in core data but also
in the iClouds stack,


1133
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:47,566
both in the client and server


1134
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,616
that will make your
applications--


1135
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:51,646
that will help make your
applications more robust


1136
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:52,296
than before.


1137
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:55,136
There are other changes in core
data as well and one of them is


1138
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:57,106
that we've enabled
write-ahead logging,


1139
00:49:57,486 --> 00:49:58,856
journaling on by default.


1140
00:49:58,856 --> 00:50:00,706
This replaces rollback
journaling


1141
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,276
that was on by default before.


1142
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:04,786
This write-ahead
logging journaling is--


1143
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:08,066
has improved reliability,
concurrency, and performance


1144
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:09,276
so it's a good thing in general.


1145
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:12,616
So you can hear more about
core data changes and core data


1146
00:50:12,616 --> 00:50:16,836
and iCloud as well tomorrow
morning in this talk,


1147
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:17,966
What's New in Core
Data and iCloud.


1148
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,686
There is also a talk
tomorrow at 2,


1149
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:23,016
core data performance
optimization and debugging.


1150
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:30,736
A new feature in objective C
for 10.9 and iOS7 is modules.


1151
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:34,566
Modules is a better way to
import a framework's interface.


1152
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:38,436
So instead of using pound
import that you're you know,


1153
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:40,506
used to love, it's been
around for a while.


1154
00:50:40,506 --> 00:50:44,596
Cocoa/cocoa.h you can now
use at import of coco.


1155
00:50:45,486 --> 00:50:49,626
What this does is it loads a
binary representation, however,


1156
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,456
I mean, just something
you could do before


1157
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:53,506
with pre-compiled headers,
but it's more flexible


1158
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:56,346
that pre-compiled headers
because you don't have to manage


1159
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,086
that list of pre-compiled
headers anymore.


1160
00:50:58,086 --> 00:50:59,746
The system will take
care of it for you.


1161
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,576
This is also immune to effects


1162
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:05,016
of local macro definitions
you know,


1163
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:08,406
there's that C programmer
mistake of pound to find int


1164
00:51:08,536 --> 00:51:10,266
to you know, short
or whatever you know.


1165
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:12,206
That will no longer be
an issue in this case


1166
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:16,596
because those macro definitions
do not take effect in interfaces


1167
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:18,876
that you've imported as modules.


1168
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:21,686
These are enabled for
new projects by default


1169
00:51:21,686 --> 00:51:24,606
and you can also enable it for
your existing projects as well.


1170
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:27,726
So there'll be a lot
more coverage of modules


1171
00:51:27,726 --> 00:51:29,636
in advances in objective C.


1172
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:30,906
I just want to mention,


1173
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:33,116
highlight of few new
frameworks we've added.


1174
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:34,396
One of them is MapKit.


1175
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:35,856
It was on iOS6.


1176
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:39,136
It's now available on 10.9.


1177
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,476
Sprite Kit, you heard
about Sprite Kit yesterday.


1178
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:46,486
It's a new framework for
doing games or applications


1179
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:50,176
with game-like animations
and physics needs and so on.


1180
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:53,186
And there's also AV
Kit which is used


1181
00:51:53,186 --> 00:51:55,006
in conjunction with
AV foundation.


1182
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:57,646
It's you know, you
can replace usage


1183
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,506
of queue ticket in
your applications.


1184
00:52:00,296 --> 00:52:03,586
There are talks for this, moving
to AV Kit and AV Foundations,


1185
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:06,216
introduction to Sprite Kit
and what's new in Map Kit.


1186
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:08,226
So I'm going to talk
a bit about Textkit.


1187
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,316
Textkit, you heard
about this yesterday


1188
00:52:11,316 --> 00:52:12,926
in the State of the Union Talk.


1189
00:52:14,036 --> 00:52:17,786
Textkit well, let me choose
Textkit by saying when you look


1190
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:21,136
at Cocoa Text on OS X,
you see NS Text View.


1191
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:24,066
However, if you make
any sophisticated use


1192
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:26,956
of the text system on OS X,
you know that's actually made


1193
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,466
up of these underlying classes


1194
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:30,696
which gives you a lot more
power and flexibility.


1195
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:35,286
When you look at Textkit on iOS,
which is a new feature in iOS7,


1196
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,866
if I didn't make that clear,


1197
00:52:37,336 --> 00:52:39,596
you see that there is
the UI Text View class


1198
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,216
which has existed
for a long time.


1199
00:52:41,536 --> 00:52:43,516
However, if you look
underneath now,


1200
00:52:43,846 --> 00:52:46,226
you'll see the same
set of classes.


1201
00:52:46,636 --> 00:52:48,266
In addition, they have the same


1202
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:50,306
or very similar set
of APIs as well.


1203
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:54,306
So I'm mentioning this to you
because yeah, those of you


1204
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:56,996
who have a sophisticated
text need of applications


1205
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:58,856
with sophisticated
text users on OS X,


1206
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:00,456
you can now import
these applications


1207
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:03,396
to iOS with a lot more ease.


1208
00:53:04,116 --> 00:53:05,616
So you can find out
more about Textkit


1209
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:08,986
in the two talks introducing
Textkit and advanced Textkit.


1210
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:13,076
OK so, as I'm running out of
time, I just want to throw


1211
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:16,506
up a list of some other
changes we have bunch


1212
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:18,336
of Table View outline
view improvements,


1213
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,166
we have layer-backed
new improvements.


1214
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,546
Again please look at the
release notes, read about these.


1215
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:27,036
NSSlider has some new APIs and
we got rid of some crusty ones.


1216
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:28,146
Some built-in services,


1217
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:30,826
additional built-in services
and NSSharingService.


1218
00:53:31,216 --> 00:53:33,086
There's some NSCalendar
convenience APIs


1219
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,496
which make it easier to move
your code back and forth


1220
00:53:35,496 --> 00:53:37,336
between UIColor and NSColor.


1221
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,756
We've-- all right, some
people have tried that


1222
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:41,846
and now it's even better.


1223
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,176
So we've deprecated some NSNib


1224
00:53:44,176 --> 00:53:46,166
and NSBundle nib-loading
methods.


1225
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,516
And the new ones
we had introduced


1226
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,656
in 10.8 are the ones you
should move forward to.


1227
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:53,606
And in foundation, we have
some further NSURL improvements


1228
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:54,636
beyond the ones I've talked


1229
00:53:54,636 --> 00:53:57,636
about including some built-in
character sets for URL handling.


1230
00:53:58,046 --> 00:54:01,976
NS metadata APIs and foundation
level attribute names you no


1231
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:04,016
longer have to go
to CF level APIs


1232
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:06,256
to get your spotlight
attribute names.


1233
00:54:07,106 --> 00:54:12,186
NSUser defaults suite--
whatever, I can't say that word.


1234
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,986
If you have a bunch of related
applications and they want


1235
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:18,136
to share defaults, these are the
APIs you would use, thank you.


1236
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:22,666
And then also NSScanner has
support for unsigned long long.


1237
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,056
So please refer to the
10.9 release notes.


1238
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,726
And now, I want to just put
a reminder of some features


1239
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,506
that have come and
I would have still.


1240
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:32,156
If you haven't taken advantage


1241
00:54:32,156 --> 00:54:34,326
of these features
please consider doing so.


1242
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:36,516
Some of these have
been around since 10.7.


1243
00:54:36,516 --> 00:54:37,706
In fact some earlier than that


1244
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:39,256
and some were introduced
in 10.8.


1245
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,046
But these are all great features


1246
00:54:41,046 --> 00:54:42,996
that will make your
applications more powerful,


1247
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:44,656
more consistent,
more user-friendly.


1248
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:48,636
So please freeze frame
this on your VCRs at home


1249
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:50,686
and choose the features
you want to implement.


1250
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:52,616
We have a lot of
related sessions.


1251
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:55,766
I'm not going to go through
them, just highlight one here.


1252
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:58,306
I've already put these up
in other slides but one


1253
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:00,516
that I haven't talked about
is if you have an iOS App,


1254
00:55:00,516 --> 00:55:01,946
you're thinking of
bring it to OS X.


1255
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,716
We have session Thursday
morning, "Bringing your iOS Apps


1256
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:06,936
to OS X" you might
want to go to that.


1257
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:10,786
And with that, Jake Behrens
is our evangelist if you need


1258
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:12,186
to talk to an evangelist.


1259
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:14,476
And that's it, thank
you very much.


1260
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:22,560
[Applause]
