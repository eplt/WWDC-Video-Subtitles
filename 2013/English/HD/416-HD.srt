00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:14,036
>> Hello, welcome to the World
Wide Developer Conference,


3
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:17,926
this is the second automation
session today, how many went


4
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:19,896
to first session
this morning...okay.


5
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:25,996
So our little presentation
about Libraries kind of got


6
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:29,906
to you a little bit huh,
you're interested in this.


7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:37,626
This session we go in depth in
discussing AppleScript Libraries


8
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:42,626
and we'll examine not only
simple but complex ones


9
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,366
and we'll walk you
through the process


10
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,876
of how you create
those including


11
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:50,336
for the first time ever
anywhere an example of how


12
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,196
to create a scripting
dictionary.


13
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:55,566
I think once you
see how it's done,


14
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,006
it's not so frightening
it's pretty easy


15
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,226
to do it's just an XML file.


16
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,826
So today we're going
to be talking


17
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:07,036
about AppleScript Libraries
and what they can do for you.


18
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:12,226
Let's try click, welcome, today
it's AppleScript Libraries,


19
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:16,626
we covered that and we're
going to be learning


20
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:20,716
about what they are,
how you incorporate them


21
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:23,896
into your environment, how
you call them, how use them,


22
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:28,406
how you create them and
how you can deploy them.


23
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:32,166
So begin with, why
Libraries...those who were


24
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:37,426
at the first session understand
that I'm one of those kind


25
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:44,046
of people that is a code
maven, I have sampled routines


26
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:47,266
that do just about
everything and I have them all


27
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,706
over the place on my drives
and I'm very thankful now


28
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,846
that we have iCloud
support so I can keep them


29
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:58,206
in one central location
but I like to use routines


30
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:02,926
and handlers in my scripts quite
a bit instead of writing code


31
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,206
over and over, I like
just getting the routines


32
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,606
and handlers and pasting
them into my scripts.


33
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:10,656
So if you're like me and you
use the same routine over


34
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:13,296
and over you're going
to like Libraries,


35
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,886
they're going to
be useful for you.


36
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:18,686
Again if you are a person


37
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:23,326
that uses third party scripting
additions to find that command


38
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,526
that was missing in
AppleScript you're going


39
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,426
to like Libraries as well.


40
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:34,116
If you just want to be someone
that can simplify your scripts


41
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:36,816
if you want to take all
this complexity and routines


42
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:41,096
and handlers out of your scripts
and just have an easier way


43
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,796
to manage them and to be able


44
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,386
to call them globally throughout
your scripts you're going


45
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:47,516
to like Libraries.


46
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:50,656
It all started because you
know once I learned how


47
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:54,556
to create a subroutine or
handler I started using them


48
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,816
and I would put them in my
scripts and it worked very well


49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,056
and then I would create
another one and then I would put


50
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,866
in in some of my scripts and
not in some of the other ones


51
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,406
and I would update one but
I didn't update the other


52
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,776
and then I added more routines


53
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,676
and then the next
thing you know it gets


54
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:14,586
to be this real big jumble
that you try to manage.


55
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:18,416
Well we're solving that
issue and those problems now


56
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:21,706
in Mavericks with
the introduction


57
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,386
of AppleScript Libraries.


58
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:27,756
They are a new plug in
architecture for AppleScript


59
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:33,566
that allows you to create
powerful collections of handlers


60
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:39,296
and tools yourself and deploy
them across your machinery.


61
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:44,636
In addition, they differ from
the standard scripting addition


62
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:48,606
that we're used to using all
the time in a couple ways.


63
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:51,616
First of all they can be written
in AppleScript, you don't have


64
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:58,016
to know C or C ++ in order to
create an AppleScript Library.


65
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:01,756
Because Libraries are
loaded by the script,


66
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:04,466
the script is controlling
how they use


67
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,886
and that will help you
avoid terminology conflicts


68
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:12,506
or resource problems, all
of that kind of goes away


69
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:17,005
because the script is
loading the Library


70
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,886
and the Libraries
live within the space


71
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:22,396
of the application that's
executing the script.


72
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:27,446
Now AppleScript Libraries have
some extra abilities to help you


73
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:29,936
out and the first one
that's really important is


74
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,476
that they can take advantage
of AppleScript objective C.


75
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:41,146
AppleScript objective C exposes
the Cocoa classes to AppleScript


76
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:45,176
so things like NS String
become available to you


77
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:48,886
and all the methods from
that and the instants methods


78
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,516
from that now become
available for you to use


79
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:55,356
in your AppleScripts scripts
and your AppleScript Libraries.


80
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:00,886
In addition you can also have
your libraries publish their own


81
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:05,126
terminology which means
instead of you having


82
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:09,906
to remember a specific handler
name and a specific order


83
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,186
of indicators or
data pass throughs


84
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:16,266
or whatever you can actually
use English like terms


85
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:20,546
that you create that work for
you and have those be the way


86
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:23,856
that you call the
AppleScript Library


87
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,026
so the handlers within
the Library.


88
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,616
So it's very powerful
and in support


89
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:31,036
of that we've created a
couple new constructs,


90
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:37,006
the first is a Script Library
reference, a way to easily refer


91
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:40,446
to a Script Library that you
have installed on your computer.


92
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:44,146
You'll see how that differs
from the old load Script


93
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:48,536
that we all used to use
as a substitute for this.


94
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:52,786
Then finally we've
created a new construct


95
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,326
that is called the use
clause and it's a way


96
00:05:56,326 --> 00:06:01,106
to import terminology and
to bring in dictionaries


97
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,266
and libraries into your script


98
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:06,586
and have them be available
globally throughout.


99
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,076
So let's take a look at this,


100
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:15,066
now in the old days before
this many of us have tried


101
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:20,536
to use the old script storing
techniques that we had available


102
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:24,176
through the scripting
addition of load script.


103
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:29,026
Now if you go to your library
pallet in the AppleScript editor


104
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:31,246
and you select standard
editions and you open


105
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,936
up the dictionary window for the
standard editions you have nine


106
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,286
suites in the dictionary and
one of those suites deals


107
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:43,736
with scripting commands and one
of those commands is load script


108
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,996
and here is the definition
for that, let's zoom that in.


109
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:54,116
Now this command was designed
for you to be able to point


110
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:59,386
at a specific script file,
load its contents into memory


111
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:03,006
and then talk to that
script file in memory


112
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,486
and have it do things for you.


113
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:09,496
But there are a couple
issues with using this


114
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,456
and here's an example script


115
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:14,826
that uses the load
script scripting edition.


116
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,636
You can see that the first
thing is you have to know


117
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:23,816
where the script that you are
using as a library exists,


118
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:27,186
where is it, you have to
have its exact location


119
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,696
and then once you've identified


120
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:33,676
where it is then you perform
this load script and store it


121
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:38,836
into a variable that represents
the contents of that script.


122
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:42,656
Then elsewhere in your
script you talk to that


123
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:46,776
and you call its handlers or
whatever handlers are available


124
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:51,526
within it and have it work but
this is a problem because first


125
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,726
of all it requires that you know
exactly where it is and if it's


126
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,366
on a different machine then
you have to develop way


127
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:00,156
to locate folders locally,


128
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,186
regardless of how drives
are named and you have


129
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:06,526
to have error handlers to
make sure that they're there


130
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:07,666
and those kind of things


131
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:14,066
and then it requires explicit
loading, explicit loading,


132
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:19,556
explicit loading of the targeted
script file, you have to do that


133
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:25,426
and it also requires that
you address the handlers


134
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:29,376
from within the loaded
script file directly and pass


135
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,766
through information to them.


136
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:34,025
This means that there's
no custom terminology,


137
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,506
you have to remember
handler names,


138
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:40,256
you have to remember the order
of the various components


139
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:44,536
of the handler and there's
no access to the power


140
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:48,706
of AppleScript objective C and
the wonderful Cocoa Libraries


141
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,836
that are available
too on the computer.


142
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,006
So there are some issues


143
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:55,466
with using the load
script scripting edition


144
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,036
and we've addressed
a lot of those


145
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:01,936
with our AppleScript Libraries
so let's take a look at it.


146
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,826
We're going to start
very simply;


147
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:09,126
I always like starting
exploring a new concept


148
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,116
in the most fundamental ways.


149
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,176
So we're going to look at
simple AppleScript Libraries,


150
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:17,766
you might never write
something this simple yourself


151
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:20,046
but by examining
this we're going


152
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,906
to learn the principles behind
this whole architecture,


153
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,376
is that okay, we'll
start simple...good.


154
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:29,006
Specifically we're going
to look at a problem


155
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,306
that exists all the time


156
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:35,066
of solving the missing command
problem, I want to be able


157
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:38,836
to do something but there's no
AppleScript command for that.


158
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:42,836
So by examining this little
issue we're going to learn how


159
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:45,776
to create and use
AppleScript Libraries.


160
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:52,146
Now for our example of a missing
command here is the new notes


161
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:56,076
application in Mavericks,
I'm going to select some text


162
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:59,156
in there and then right click
the selection so it brings


163
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:00,976
up the contextual menu.


164
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,646
Now some of you might know


165
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:08,346
that for a couple system
releases now we implemented some


166
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:12,216
new text handling options


167
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:16,536
within the standard text
contextual menu and one


168
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:20,816
of them is transformations
where you have the option


169
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:26,106
to change the case of selected
text to upper case, lower case,


170
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:30,606
capitalize or that's
called word case sometimes


171
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,636
and you might find it
called that as well.


172
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:37,386
But this is a command that's
available on the contextual menu


173
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:42,396
but it's not available from
within AppleScript itself.


174
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:46,646
So what I want to do is
use this as an example


175
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:52,016
when we're creating our
simple library to begin with


176
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,366
and we're going to look
at being able to convert


177
00:10:56,366 --> 00:11:00,196
to upper case transformation, so
we'll have something like how,


178
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:05,946
now brown cow in lower case
transforms to how now brown cow


179
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:10,206
in upper case, we're going to
have a lower case transformation


180
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:13,256
and instead of capitalization
I'm just going


181
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,276
to call it a word
case transformation


182
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,636
where the first letter of
each word is capitalized


183
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:21,956
and this is what we're going
to use as our sample command.


184
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:25,686
We're going to look
at this in two types


185
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,466
of simple script libraries,


186
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:32,276
one where the library is written
entirely in native AppleScript


187
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,736
and two, where the library
is written using AppleScript


188
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:37,736
objective C.


189
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:41,236
So just to review
here we're going


190
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:45,196
to take this missing command of
transformed text and we're going


191
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,506
to use that and create
two simple libraries


192
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,866
to address the fact that's
it's not native in AppleScript.


193
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,486
We're going to create
one in AppleScript,


194
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:55,606
one in AppleScript
objective C, let's begin.


195
00:11:56,386 --> 00:12:01,576
An AppleScript script
library, so it beings


196
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:04,986
with having a handler some
kind of AppleScript handler


197
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,896
and here I have one,
you'll notice that the name


198
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,426
of the handler is
change case of text,


199
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:13,696
we'll use this handler
throughout here


200
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:19,046
and it has two parameters,
one is the source text


201
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:22,516
or the what you want
to transform,


202
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:24,226
the text that you
want to transform


203
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:28,106
and the second is a case
indicator and this case


204
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:32,306
of this handler it's going
to a numeric value zero


205
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:36,846
or 1 that indicates whether
you want upper or lower case.


206
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:41,736
It's a simple AppleScript
based upon your case indicator,


207
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:45,176
it creates two comparison
lists and then iterate


208
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:48,226
through all the characters
in the past text


209
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,276
and matches whether
it's an iteration list


210
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:55,106
and then finally returns
the resulting string back


211
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,966
to the script itself.


212
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:00,686
Something simple right, now
we're going to take this


213
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,476
and make this and make
this into a library


214
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,416
and it's simplest
doing the following.


215
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,156
We're just going to take a blank
script in the AppleScript editor


216
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,786
and we're going to paste
the handler into this,


217
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:17,666
we're going to compile it
and then just click save


218
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:21,736
and we're going to save
it as a script file


219
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:27,146
and you'll notice we named it
AppleScript text transform is


220
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,776
the name of this little library.


221
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,876
Now libraries can
contain multiple handlers


222
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,576
but for our example
they're just going


223
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,386
to contain one handler, okay.


224
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:41,846
And we simply name the
library and then save it.


225
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:44,766
Next we install the
script library,


226
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,526
and the way that you
install it is you go


227
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,606
to your home library
folder and within


228
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:54,886
that library folder you create
a new folder called Script


229
00:13:55,036 --> 00:14:01,866
Libraries and then you take your
newly saved AppleScript file


230
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:06,726
and you drag that into the
Script Libraries folders


231
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,986
and it becomes part of
the AppleScript system


232
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:14,246
on your computer, that's it,
it's now installed for you.


233
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:18,906
So how do you use the
AppleScript script library?


234
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:22,566
Now that we've created this
simple library with one handler


235
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:26,186
for transforming the case of
text here's how you use it.


236
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,596
We have a new construct in
AppleScript and it's a way


237
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:34,816
to identify easily
AppleScript Libraries.


238
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:39,766
So you no longer need to
point to a specific file


239
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:42,856
through a file reference
like you did with LoadScript


240
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:48,516
and you no longer need to
explicitly load the file


241
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:53,426
and all you need to do now is
you go into a blank script,


242
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,696
you type the word script
followed by the name


243
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:02,966
of your library and you notice
I left the name extension off,


244
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,666
you don't need to have
the name extension there.


245
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:09,866
So script, AppleScript
transform and then


246
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:15,596
when I compile this you'll
notice that it formats


247
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:22,106
and this is now a
AppleScript Library reference,


248
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,816
it's a way to point
to that library,


249
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:29,746
it was automatically located on
your system and it's prepared


250
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:33,726
for use, it's ready to
go all you have to do


251
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,806
to address it is you can
place the verb tell before it


252
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:40,696
or in this case you could
enclose it within a tell block


253
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,816
and then refer to
one of the handlers


254
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,876
within that particular library.


255
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:51,336
So here I have the name of our
handler is change case of text,


256
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:56,106
I'm passing into the
handler how now brown cow


257
00:15:56,376 --> 00:16:00,326
and I have a case indicator of
one meaning I want upper case.


258
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:05,126
So I run my script, it
automatically gets processed


259
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,786
by your AppleScript library


260
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,986
and the results are
returned back to the script.


261
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:13,026
So that's the basic process


262
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:17,936
of creating a very simple
basic AppleScript Library.


263
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:21,046
So here's the routine
that we used,


264
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:27,726
it's a little subroutine now it
does convert case of some text


265
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:30,146
from upper to lower
and lower to upper


266
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:34,756
but it doesn't handle special
characters and it doesn't work


267
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:36,426
with multiple languages.


268
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:40,626
In order to have an
AppleScript handler to do all


269
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,156
that it might be as
long as I am tall


270
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:48,486
or a couple times past that, it
would be very complex to do all


271
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:50,316
that in native AppleScript.


272
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,236
So in this case we need
to turn to something


273
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:56,046
with a little bit more
power and we're going


274
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:59,696
to create our second library
example using the power


275
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,786
of AppleScript objective C.


276
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,796
So this will be a
simple library written


277
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,856
in AppleScript objective C,
everybody with me so far?


278
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,195
Not so hard right, okay good.


279
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:17,796
Okay here's the same handler,
this time it's change case


280
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:23,156
of text and it gets two things
passed to it, numeric indicator,


281
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:26,266
I mean the source text that
we're going to transform


282
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:29,216
and a numeric indicator
indicating text.


283
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:32,026
But this time the body
of the handler is written


284
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:35,266
in AppleScript objective
C and the first thing


285
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:38,646
that the handler does
is convert the past


286
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:45,146
into a Cocoa string using NS
string method called string


287
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:50,826
with string, then based upon the
numeric indicator that's passed


288
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:55,256
through the numeric case
indicator it executes a method


289
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:59,336
on that instance, either upper
case string, lower case string


290
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,656
or capitalized string.


291
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:04,606
Once that transforms
been applied and copied


292
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:06,046
into the variable next


293
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:10,716
to it adjusted string the
handler returns the adjusted


294
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,766
string back to the script
as text by just saying


295
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:20,236
as text in your coercion.


296
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:23,016
So this is the handler
that we're going to use


297
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,986
in our second example library.


298
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:30,946
We take a blank script
and we paste our handler,


299
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:34,716
the AppleScript objective C
handler into our script, we save


300
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:39,946
and in the sheet to save a
little bit of time I'm going


301
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:42,036
to save it into the
script libraries folder


302
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:45,376
that I already created instead
of dragging it in the finder.


303
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:48,076
You can if you...you
can drag if you want to


304
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,596
but for our purposes here
I'm just going to save it


305
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,676
into the newly created
script libraries folder.


306
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,876
Next I'm going to give
it a different name,


307
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:01,696
I'm going to call this one ASOC
text transform and ASOC stands


308
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:03,426
for AppleScript objective C.


309
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,546
Finally at the bottom
under format instead


310
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,336
of the standard script file
format we're going to choose


311
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:13,796
to save this as a script bundle


312
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,666
and you'll see why
in just a moment.


313
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:23,406
So we save our script and then
you'll notice once you've saved


314
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:27,996
it in a bundle format at the top
menu bar there's a new button


315
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:32,106
that becomes available and
what that button does is


316
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:35,416
when you toggle it, it
will show you the contents


317
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:40,846
of the script bundle so if I
click that a drawer is exposed


318
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,426
and this drawer contains a lot


319
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,116
of valuable information
about this bundle.


320
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:50,256
First of all it contains the
name of the script library,


321
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,386
it contains its bundle
identifier


322
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,226
where you can put
your developer domain


323
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,546
and name it whatever you like,


324
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:02,506
it contains a short version
number, a bundle version number,


325
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:07,646
a copyright string, the
terminology file name


326
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:12,946
and a check box indicating
whether this library uses


327
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:18,126
AppleScript objective C, a
scroll area down at the bottom


328
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:21,136
that will display the contents
of your resource folder


329
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:25,906
and a little magic pop up menu
that does particular actions


330
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:29,026
with things that you've
selected in the resource folder.


331
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,496
So in this particular instance
there's only four things


332
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,426
that we're interested in.


333
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:38,296
They are...we're going to
start by adding the name


334
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:44,416
of our library, ASOC text
transform, in the name field,


335
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:48,836
we're going to give it our
developer domain identifier


336
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:54,296
so here my company is nighthawk
productions dot asoc dot text


337
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:59,146
dot transform and then we're
going to give a copyright string


338
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:03,026
and most importantly we're
going to check the check box


339
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:07,516
that says this library uses
AppleScript objective C.


340
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:09,426
Those are the four
things we want to do


341
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:10,756
since we're creating a library


342
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:13,126
that uses AppleScript
objective C.


343
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,296
Once we've done that then
I can close the drawer,


344
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:24,256
save the script file, now
I've already installed this,


345
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,876
remember I've saved it into
the script libraries folder,


346
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,876
if you didn't you can drag it


347
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:31,476
in yourself before
doing the next step.


348
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,906
Now that I've had this library


349
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:38,886
and it's installed how do
you use it, well the same way


350
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,916
that you used the
earlier library,


351
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,126
the first thing you do is
you type the word script,


352
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,676
followed by the name
of the library,


353
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:49,746
in this case it's ASOC text
transform, you compile it


354
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:52,966
and you get your
AppleScript library reference,


355
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:58,466
identifier so this indicates
to me because it's complied


356
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:03,026
that the script has located the
library, prepared it for use,


357
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:07,136
it's ready to go, I can
encase it within a tell block


358
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:12,156
like I did before, I can
refer to the handler within,


359
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,556
I can pass text into the handler


360
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:18,346
and my first indicator is
the...case indicator is the


361
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,316
number zero.


362
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:24,676
So I run it and the result
will be all upper case how now


363
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,696
brown cow.


364
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:30,286
Let's iterate that case
indicator to the number one,


365
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:35,086
run it again wa-la [phonetic]
I have all lower case,


366
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,476
let's iterate it again
to the number two


367
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:42,446
and I will get word case
where the first character


368
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,316
of every word is capitalized.


369
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:51,016
So this handler is much better
than the earlier handler


370
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,836
that was just written
in AppleScript,


371
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:57,146
it really has a lot more power
and ability because it taps


372
00:22:57,146 --> 00:23:00,536
into the power of the
Cocoa class NS String


373
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:01,906
to do all the heavy lifting.


374
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,976
Now this works by converting


375
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:07,956
to all the case conversions
we need,


376
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,656
it works with special
characters and it works


377
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,106
with multiple languages.


378
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:18,096
So this is a very useful one and
to demo this I'm going to bring


379
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,976
up my friend Chris Page from
the AppleScript team, thank you.


380
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:26,556
[ Applause ]


381
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,986
>> Now this is a script
that Sal showed you earlier


382
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:32,606
and it has a function that
changes the case of some text


383
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:36,966
and just a trivial example of
using that and I'm going to run


384
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,766
that script and we can
see the result down here.


385
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,746
We converted this
string to upper case.


386
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:44,506
So just very quickly I'm going


387
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,446
to give you the quick run
through, this is what happens


388
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:48,796
when you already
know how to do this.


389
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,826
I'm going to take this
function, I'm going to copy it


390
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:56,966
into a new script and
I'm going to save it


391
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,556
in the script libraries
folder and the slowest part


392
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:00,756
of this is giving it a name,


393
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:07,016
I'm going to call it AppleScript
change case and we're done,


394
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:09,066
we've now created a library.


395
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:13,516
Now I'm going to run through
that a little bit slower


396
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:15,686
for people who are
trying to follow along,


397
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:23,316
I'm going to copy this
text, create a new script,


398
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,926
paste it in and save it.


399
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:32,456
Now this is...if this is
the first time doing this


400
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:34,826
and you don't have the script
libraries folder here's a little


401
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:41,416
trick you can press Command
Shift G to bring up this sheet


402
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,566
that lets you navigate
to the libraries folder


403
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,186
in your home directory because
the library folder is normally


404
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:49,636
hidden from users but as a
developer you need to know this


405
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,176
to be able to get
to that folder.


406
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:53,006
You can also get
there in finder.


407
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:58,066
Then you would use the New
Folder button to create


408
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:02,176
that folder and then you
could save the script


409
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:06,426
in there and that's it.


410
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:10,856
I'm going to close
this and now I'm going


411
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:17,276
to take the client code that
uses this library I'm going


412
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:21,426
to copy it out of there
and create a new script,


413
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:24,256
I'm going to close this
one so it's out of our way


414
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,036
and paste the code in.


415
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,516
Now I'm going to show you
how to use the library


416
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:33,046
if you were following
along earlier,


417
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:34,196
this might look very familiar,


418
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:43,206
I'm going to say tell script
AppleScript, change case


419
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:49,756
and I'm going to compile it
and you can see that it works.


420
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,266
I manage not to misspell
the library name.


421
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:57,596
If I had just to show you,
if I put an x into the name


422
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:58,846
which means it's not
going to be found,


423
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:02,266
when we try to compile it
we get an error that says


424
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,646
that it couldn't find that
script so you'll know early


425
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,986
on during script development
whether you've referred


426
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:13,276
to a library correctly and when
I run it we get the same result,


427
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:15,326
how now brown cow
is in upper case.


428
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:20,246
That is the simplest case of
using the script library just


429
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,916
to reuse a function
you've been using


430
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,786
in your scripts up till now.


431
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:34,186
Now we want to take advantage
of AppleScript objective C


432
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,026
to do more than we can
do with AppleScript,


433
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:45,226
if I take this string


434
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:52,026
and introduce some accented
characters and run you can see


435
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:53,966
down here in the results


436
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:57,876
that the accented o's did not
get converted to upper case.


437
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:02,016
That's because AppleScript
doesn't have native support


438
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,926
for doing case changes and
it doesn't...you would have


439
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:08,116
to write a very extensive script
to handle all the characters


440
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:13,586
in Unicode but the foundation
framework that's part


441
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:18,126
of Cocoa has in a string
class that has a rich variety


442
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:19,946
of text manipulation functions,


443
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,916
several interesting
ones for changing case.


444
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:24,846
So we're going to
take advantage of that


445
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:28,666
in an AppleScript objective
C version of the library


446
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,866
that we already created.


447
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:38,446
I'm going to create a
new script and save it


448
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:46,176
in script libraries folder
again, this time I'm going


449
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:50,466
to name it ASOC change case.


450
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:53,116
ASOC is a short hand
we sometimes use


451
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:57,206
for AppleScript objective C
and as Sal mentioned I'll need


452
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,356
to save it as a script bundle


453
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:00,306
but that's a pretty
easy thing to do.


454
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:03,356
I'm going to open
the bundle drawer


455
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,546
and update...well the
simplest thing that I have


456
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:10,766
to do here is enable
AppleScript objective C library,


457
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,936
that makes ASOC available
when this code is running


458
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:18,046
and while I'm here I'm going
to fill out these other fields.


459
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,096
These fields set values inside


460
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,126
of the info P list file inside
the bundle, there's a lot


461
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:25,026
of documentation
about how do that


462
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:27,976
and how the various fields work
if you're unfamiliar with them


463
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:32,476
and I'm going to fill in a
couple pieces of information,


464
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:42,706
I've got my...the name, ASOC
change case and I'm going


465
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:46,406
to put my bundle
identifier in here


466
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:51,026
which I mistyped...let
me try it again.


467
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:57,166
Okay the version number default
is 1.0, we highly recommend


468
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,516
that you take advantage
of version numbers


469
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:02,516
because when you start
distributing and reusing


470
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:05,056
and updating libraries you
can use it to distinguish


471
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:06,286
which version you're
talking about.


472
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,986
I'm going to show you
later there's a way for you


473
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:13,436
to have your script check
the version to make sure


474
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,526
that it's new enough
for your client script


475
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,486
and I'll put a copyright
notice in here.


476
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:28,166
But again all we really need
to do was click this check box,


477
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,946
let me put that script aside
for a moment and now I'm going


478
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:37,606
to put in the AppleScript
version of our library code.


479
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:42,376
This is essentially the same
function, we haven't changed


480
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:44,966
that we're just changing
the implementation,


481
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:49,086
like Sal mentioned earlier
we construct an NS String


482
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:53,836
from our AppleScript string,
we call the appropriate method


483
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:56,486
of NS String to do the
capitalization we want


484
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,056
and then we return it
and convert it back


485
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,276
to an AppleScript string.


486
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:10,856
All right so that's it we've
created an AppleScript objective


487
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:14,006
C version of the library
and now let's use it.


488
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:18,736
I'm going to go back to my
client script and I'm just going


489
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:26,266
to change the name to match
our new library and I'm going


490
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:31,916
to run it and this time you
can see in the result pane


491
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:37,876
that all the accented o's have
been converted to upper case.


492
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,036
Furthermore we now
have a third options


493
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,956
because the NS String
class has a method


494
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:46,026
for doing capitalization,
it capitalizes every word


495
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:48,686
in your string, we can put
a different value in here


496
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:54,046
and run it and so now we've
extended...now we get the word


497
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,986
capitalized version
of the string.


498
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,196
So you can see that using
AppleScript objective C we can


499
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:02,136
go beyond what we
can do in AppleScript


500
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:05,136
and we can replace large
chunks of AppleScript


501
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:06,756
that might have had to do
a lot of their own work


502
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:11,386
with existing framework
functions that are available


503
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:13,076
on the system to every
other application.


504
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,506
Now you can use them
in libraries


505
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,226
which means you can use them in
your scripts and script applets.


506
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,116
Just briefly I want to
mention that when we look


507
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,156
up libraries we search
in a number of locations,


508
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:28,586
Sal will mention those later
and we start by looking


509
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,196
in the current applications
bundle which means


510
00:31:31,196 --> 00:31:34,146
that you can conveniently
distribute an applet


511
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,876
that contains libraries that
you want to bundle with it


512
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:41,986
and the user can just make
that...put that application


513
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:43,476
on the machine and
run it without having


514
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:45,476
to install libraries
anywhere before use.


515
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:48,131
[ Applause ]


516
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:49,026
Okay thank you.


517
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,656
>> So you can see that
it's not just magic


518
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:56,616
on a slide you can actually
do this stuff live, right,


519
00:31:57,746 --> 00:32:02,076
and so we were looking at the
example that Chris had there


520
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,376
and if we look at the syntax
that was involved here,


521
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:12,226
we have tell the script library
identifier to call this method,


522
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:17,496
now the short coming in this
whole process or the got cha


523
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:21,086
in all this process is that
if you have a lot of libraries


524
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:25,696
or you have complex libraries,
you have to remember the names


525
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,866
of all these different
handlers and you have


526
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,756
to remember what parameters
are passed through.


527
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,206
It would be so much nicer
if I could just...instead


528
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:37,876
of saying change case
of text like that,


529
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,206
if I could just use some
words I could remember


530
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:44,346
like transform text and
then give it the text


531
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:47,986
as a direct parameter to
and then use some word


532
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:51,266
like upper case instead
of a number or lower case


533
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:56,006
or word case, I really
want to be able to say this


534
00:32:56,006 --> 00:33:00,756
because I can remember this,
remembering the names of 150


535
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:04,856
or 200 different handlers that's
really a pain, I want to be able


536
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,946
to use this kind of terminology.


537
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:11,916
So this is what we want to do
as we examine the next thing


538
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,646
of creating libraries
with terminology.


539
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:19,186
Step one is you start
with the dictionary.


540
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:24,446
So here is an example
dictionary of a script library,


541
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:28,776
it's not a really complex one
but it's quite functional,


542
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:30,446
it has one suite in it,


543
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:34,276
it's called AppleScript text
utilities, there's two commands


544
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:39,796
in the suite, one is for
transforming text, the other is


545
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:42,316
for replacing strings in text.


546
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:46,506
You can see the definition for
the suite and the definition


547
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:49,706
for each one of the
particular commands.


548
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:53,026
This is actually a file;


549
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:57,516
scripting dictionaries
are actually files


550
00:33:57,516 --> 00:34:01,516
that get displayed within the
AppleScript editor application.


551
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:08,235
These scripting dictionary files
are called sdefs which stands


552
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:12,356
for scripting dictionary
and they are placed inside


553
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:15,396
of the bundle of your
AppleScript library


554
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,775
so for the first time ever
today we're going to look at how


555
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:23,446
to create an sdef or a
scripting definition file


556
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:25,866
or just call the
scripting dictionary.


557
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:29,226
Now these are XML
based documents,


558
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,856
they have a name
extension of .sdef


559
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:36,426
and they define the
various scripting elements


560
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:38,746
that are part of your library.


561
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:44,346
For example a suite or a command
that might have parameters


562
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,976
and it might also
use enumerations


563
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,306
in the command as well.


564
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:54,376
In addition you can
include documentation


565
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:57,386
in your scripting dictionary
so that your customer


566
00:34:57,576 --> 00:35:00,346
or you can actually
see an example script


567
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:02,286
that uses the terminology.


568
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,826
So let's look at
how this is done.


569
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:12,416
This is a scripting dictionary
file, this is an sdef.


570
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:16,616
It's an empty sdef but it
is a fully formed empty sdef


571
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,656
and you can edit this
with you know any


572
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:23,016
of the great applications
we have out there


573
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:26,396
that can edit XML documents.


574
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:33,216
We're going to use this when
we define our terminology


575
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,066
for an AppleScript dictionary.


576
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:38,916
The first line is
an XML declaration,


577
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,946
it's a standard declaration
used by every XML file.


578
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:48,246
Next becomes a reference
to the DTD


579
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,346
or document type declaration.


580
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:55,176
This is just boiler plate
stuff, it points to a folder


581
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:58,936
in your system folder that
contains the master sdef file


582
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,976
that tells the system how
an sdef file is supposed


583
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:02,546
to be read.


584
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:08,086
Then finally there's a
pairing of tags for dictionary,


585
00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:12,326
it's an open and close tag
for dictionary and we're going


586
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:17,116
to use this as our template for
creating a dictionary that works


587
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:21,466
with this command, transform
text how now brown cow


588
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,416
to upper case.


589
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:25,156
So I'm just going to leave that
on the bottom of the screen


590
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:28,596
as we do this so we can
keep in mind how this works.


591
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:32,506
Are you ready to go...here we
go, so the first thing I'm going


592
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:37,896
to do is insert within the
dictionary tags a new set


593
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,646
of tags called suite, I'm
going to create a script suite.


594
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:47,016
The opening tag to the script
suite has a couple parameters,


595
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:50,966
one is the name, I'm going
to call it text utilities


596
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:53,926
and a description, I
can give a description


597
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:59,576
and then a four character
code, Apple reserves the use


598
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:03,176
of four character codes
that are all lower case.


599
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:07,346
So those are used by Apple
applications like definder


600
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:11,386
to define their objects, you're
welcome to use any combination


601
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:14,636
of upper case and lower case
letters that you want that work


602
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:17,966
for you, in this case I
have four upper case letters


603
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:23,236
that I'm using for the four
character code for my suite.


604
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:27,036
Next I'm going to open up
this suite and I'm going


605
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:31,776
to insert a command, I want to
put a command in my script suite


606
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,126
and the opening tag


607
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:39,676
of the command tag pairing
has a couple of attributes.


608
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:43,716
The first is the name, that's
the name of the command


609
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,756
in this case it's
transform text,


610
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:50,096
so I want that to be
the name of the command,


611
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,046
that's what I'm going
to remember in my brain


612
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:57,326
when I write my scripts and
it gets and 8 character code,


613
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:00,336
commands are the only thing
that gets this 8 character code


614
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,206
and the reason it does is


615
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:06,466
because the first four
characters are usually the code


616
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:09,686
of the suite that the
command belongs to followed


617
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,556
by an additional four characters
so that's what I did here.


618
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:18,606
Next we're going to open up the
command pairing and we're going


619
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:20,876
to insert a direct
parameter tag.


620
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:25,926
Now the direct parameter is the
object that we're addressing


621
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:27,536
in this case the text.


622
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:32,256
So it has a couple of
attributes in this tag,


623
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:37,756
the first is the kind of data,
in this case type is text


624
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:41,096
and then the description,
the text to transform.


625
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:44,036
There's no code necessary


626
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:47,096
because this is the direct
parameter of my command.


627
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:52,916
Once I've done that now I can
continue defining my...the scope


628
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:56,436
of my command by addressing
the second parameter here,


629
00:38:56,806 --> 00:39:00,906
so I insert a parameter
tag in my command pairing


630
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:04,236
and this one gets
the name of two,


631
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,386
it gets a four character code


632
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:10,846
and under type I
have case conversion.


633
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:16,686
Now case conversion is not
a data type or anything


634
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:20,246
in particular it happens
to be the name of the set


635
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:22,936
of enumerations that
I'm going to be using,


636
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:27,996
I'm going to create another,
another pairing later in my sdef


637
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:31,896
that will hold the enumerations
like upper case, lower case,


638
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:34,876
word case so for right
now I'm just going to type


639
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:38,766
in case conversion
and then that's it.


640
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:41,406
That's my basic command
tag right there.


641
00:39:42,376 --> 00:39:47,866
After that I'll insert a pairing
for enumeration and this is


642
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:52,406
where I will list the various
enumerators like upper case,


643
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:56,296
word case, it gets a
couple of attributes,


644
00:39:56,396 --> 00:40:00,816
the most important being its
name has to match the type


645
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:05,506
that you just called in the
previous command so the type


646
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:10,786
for the parameter in the command
has to match the name of the set


647
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,886
of enumerations that
we're going to use


648
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:16,356
and it also gets its
own four character code.


649
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:22,556
Once I've created the
enumeration set I can insert my


650
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:25,856
first enumerator, it gets
a couple of parameters,


651
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:27,876
it's name is going
to be upper case,


652
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,076
it's gets a four character code


653
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:34,156
and then we can insert the other
two enumerators, lower case,


654
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:37,406
word case, each with its
own four character code.


655
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:41,716
That's the sdef that will
define the use of this command,


656
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:43,496
that's a fully formed


657
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:49,586
and correct scripting definition
file for having a single suite


658
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:54,456
with a single command that is
transform text direct parameter


659
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:58,306
to enumerator upper case,
lower case, word case.


660
00:40:58,606 --> 00:40:59,726
This is what it looks like,


661
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,656
if you saved this you
could just stop there


662
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,876
but you can do a little
bit of extra and I suggest


663
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,746
that you make that effort.


664
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:09,586
We're going to insert


665
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:14,556
in the command pairing a
documentation tag, an open


666
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,826
and closing documentation
tag and this allows you


667
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:20,786
to put information in
there about the command


668
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:24,656
so you can help somebody out
who's reading your dictionary,


669
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:27,286
you can tell them hey this
command is used usually


670
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:31,756
for this, this is how you
say it and you'll notice


671
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:36,666
that I've included a pair of 8
opening and closing HTML tags


672
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:40,346
in there and that's because
the dictionary viewer


673
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:44,926
in the AppleScript editor used
HTML to display the formatting


674
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:48,006
and the color of the
information in its window.


675
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:53,446
So that means that I can then
take some HTML and put it


676
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:55,786
into my documentation.


677
00:41:56,406 --> 00:42:00,516
What I like to do myself is
always have an example script


678
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,366
of how to call the command.


679
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:04,976
That's what I did
here, I have an example


680
00:42:04,976 --> 00:42:08,746
that says transform text how
now brown cow to upper case.


681
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:12,366
So no matter what when the
user looks at the dictionary


682
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:15,256
for my library they can see
oh this is how you use it,


683
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,706
okay I got it.


684
00:42:17,306 --> 00:42:19,836
Now when this is all displayed


685
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:22,646
within the AppleScript editor
application it will look


686
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:27,236
something like this, you'll have
your suite definition here then


687
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:32,746
you'll have the definition of
your command and how it's called


688
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:37,796
and then my documentation so
this is all documentation,


689
00:42:38,146 --> 00:42:41,676
I apply text transformation,
for example change the case


690
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:46,206
of targeted text to upper case
and then I have a sample script


691
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:49,956
that the user can see and I show
them what the result typically


692
00:42:49,956 --> 00:42:50,536
would be.


693
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,876
So it's worth it to add
that little bit of extra


694
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:57,246
in your scripting definition
file when you create it.


695
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:03,816
Now that we've done that we save
that file, we give it the name


696
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:06,176
that we had for it,
AppleScript text utilities


697
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:07,516
and we just put it aside.


698
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:12,046
Next step is we create a
script bundle, very easy,


699
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:15,496
you go to AppleScript editor,
you open up a new file,


700
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:18,476
you go save and in
the drop down sheet


701
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,766
under file format you choose
script bundle as the format


702
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:28,186
that you want to use and then up
at the top you give it a name,


703
00:43:28,186 --> 00:43:30,756
I'm going to call this
AppleScript text utilities


704
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:31,996
and you save it.


705
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:37,396
Once it's been saved we get the
access to the bundled drawer,


706
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:42,276
we open that up and then
again here is the panel


707
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:45,156
with all the various
options for us.


708
00:43:45,546 --> 00:43:47,426
The script name, the
bundle identifier,


709
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:50,346
the short version number,
the bundle version number,


710
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:53,996
the copyright string, the
name of the sdef file,


711
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:58,216
whether we're using AppleScript
objective C, the contents


712
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:01,226
of the resources folder
and the little action menu


713
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:03,596
that you can do things
in the resources folder.


714
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,886
So in this case we're
going to move the window


715
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:10,446
to the side a little bit and
we're going to actually take


716
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:14,886
that file and drag it into
the resources folder area here


717
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:15,836
and let it go.


718
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:21,916
This will copy that sdef file
into the script bundle for us


719
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:24,446
and you can see now
it has become part


720
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:26,126
of a list that's available.


721
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:29,466
Then I can fill out the
information up there


722
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:33,366
by checking the check box that
my using AppleScript objective C


723
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:36,326
and most importantly
put the name


724
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:39,946
of the scripting definition
file, the title of it,


725
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:46,426
in that field, you can leaved
off the .sdef then you simply


726
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:50,046
save your script bundle, close
the drawer and then save it.


727
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:54,976
Next we add the code
to the script bundle,


728
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:59,816
so we have our AppleScript
Library bundle


729
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:03,606
and we've been using this one
handler over and over again


730
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:06,376
in Chris' examples and in
what I've been showing you.


731
00:45:07,056 --> 00:45:10,566
But when you have a
terminology your handler has


732
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,326
to match the terminology


733
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,996
so you here we have an
AppleScript handler,


734
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:18,666
you can tell because it begins
with on and ends with in right


735
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:23,686
but the handler syntax has
to match the terminology


736
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,266
that I defined in my
dictionary so I begin


737
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:29,156
with my command, transform text.


738
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:33,756
Next I need something to
represent my direct parameter


739
00:45:33,756 --> 00:45:36,576
so I have a variable
here called source text,


740
00:45:36,896 --> 00:45:39,766
it's going to represent
whatever text is getting passed


741
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:44,976
to my handler, then my
secondary parameter two


742
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:49,846
and then another variable called
case indicator that's going


743
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:52,976
to represent one of the
enumerations that I created,


744
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:55,146
upper case, lower
case word case.


745
00:45:55,746 --> 00:45:59,926
Let's take a look at how this
works again it takes the source


746
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:04,046
string, converts it to a Cocoa
string using NS String's string


747
00:46:04,516 --> 00:46:09,736
method, string with string and
then based upon a comparison


748
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:14,946
between what you pass into
that handler for an enumerator


749
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:18,066
versus one of the other
options it applies


750
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:22,036
and instance method wither upper
case string, lower case string


751
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,276
and then finally we
convert everything back


752
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:27,836
to just plain AppleScript
text by saying


753
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:30,196
as text and we're done.


754
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:33,636
So this is the handler
that we're going to use,


755
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:39,596
we take our bundle we paste
it into it, we save it,


756
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:43,496
next we install it in
case you didn't save it


757
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,946
into the AppleScript
Libraries folder,


758
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:48,636
script libraries folder
just take the file,


759
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:53,646
make a script libraries folder
in your home library directory


760
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:58,076
and drag that script file
in there and that's it,


761
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:01,206
it is now installed
and now we can call it


762
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:04,376
so next step using the library.


763
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:10,746
So again we can just
target the library


764
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,516
with an AppleScript
Library identifier script


765
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:16,656
and then the name of the
library and we can encase


766
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:19,606
that within a tell statement
but this time instead


767
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:20,556
of calling the name


768
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:24,756
of the handler I can just use
my terminology, transform text,


769
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:30,166
here it is to upper case and
when this runs it runs fine just


770
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,726
like the other handlers
worked, it works perfectly.


771
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:39,866
So here's an example of using
that library in a script


772
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:44,656
for the finder, so this
particular script will change


773
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,766
the case of selected
folders in the finder


774
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,426
so if I have some folders
selected and I want their names


775
00:47:50,426 --> 00:47:53,746
to be upper case this is the
script that will do that.


776
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:58,236
You can see that it runs
and the case changes.


777
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,666
Now I'll walk you
through it real quick,


778
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:04,836
you get the selected items that
are selected and you iterate


779
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:10,016
through each one then we call
our script library, right here


780
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:16,116
and then we apply the results of
the transformation to the name


781
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:17,696
and then end our repeat.


782
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:22,476
So here's our tell block,
now there's a problem


783
00:48:22,476 --> 00:48:23,536
with this tell block,


784
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:28,126
if I'm only using it once that's
not bad but if I have a script


785
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:30,996
that has to use this
all the time it's a pain


786
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:35,086
and in addition we have this
thing going on with variable


787
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:38,486
where I have to create a
variable to get the results


788
00:48:38,486 --> 00:48:42,476
of the transformation that I can
then use later on in the script


789
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:44,756
because it's outside
of the tell block.


790
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:49,516
I want all of that to go
away and we fix that issue


791
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:55,016
with a new construct that we've
created called the use clause,


792
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:59,046
so at the top of my
script I enter the word use


793
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:02,546
and then my script
library identifier and what


794
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:05,746
that does is dynamically
load my library


795
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:09,326
into memory making it globally
available throughout this


796
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:14,306
script, so I no longer need this
tell block addressing my library


797
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:18,286
and as a matter of fact once I
got rid of that I can get rid


798
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:21,736
of the nonsense with the
variables back and forth


799
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:25,516
and put everything on one line
so that the finder will talk


800
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,576
to this command transparently


801
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:30,846
and it all becomes
one single statement.


802
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:38,186
So we go from this to that with
the use clause, which is a way


803
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,976
to load and import terminology


804
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:43,586
into your script,
this is what we like.


805
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,116
Here's what it looks like
in an actual script window,


806
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:51,786
now with the use clause and
then taking out the back


807
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:54,256
and forth with the variable.


808
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:57,926
That's exactly what we
like, it's easy to remember,


809
00:49:58,106 --> 00:50:02,646
it's powerful to use, it's
clean and it's a smooth syntax.


810
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:06,626
Now when you deploy libraries,
once you've created something


811
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:09,006
like this you can put it
in multiple locations,


812
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:10,576
the one that we've been talking


813
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:12,886
about is your home
library folder


814
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:18,006
and in addition you can go to
the top level on your computer


815
00:50:18,006 --> 00:50:21,736
and you can place it in
a script libraries folder


816
00:50:21,736 --> 00:50:23,506
within that library folder.


817
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:28,796
If you have a script bundle
or a script application you


818
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:32,366
within its resources folder you
can create a script libraries


819
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,216
folder and place it in there.


820
00:50:34,556 --> 00:50:39,226
So you can pass...give
someone a AppleScript droplet


821
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:42,886
or AppleScript applet that
contains script libraries


822
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,206
that it can draw from,


823
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,466
in addition any application
that's using calling AppleScript


824
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:53,516
you can create in its resources
folder a script library folder.


825
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:58,296
So AppleScript Libraries are
a new plug-in architecture


826
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,456
enabling quick development
and access


827
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:03,466
to your favorite
sets of handlers.


828
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:06,176
It's different from
scripting additions


829
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:08,556
because you can write them
yourself in AppleScript


830
00:51:08,896 --> 00:51:11,406
and they're controlled by
the script that loads them.


831
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:14,306
They can use AppleScript
objective C


832
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:17,036
to access all the
wonderment of Cocoa


833
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:21,186
and they can also publish their
own scripting terminology.


834
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:25,156
In support of them we created
two new constructs the script


835
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:29,756
library identifier, that finds
the library for you and loads


836
00:51:30,116 --> 00:51:33,556
and we also created a new
use clause that allows you


837
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:36,656
to load the library
for global access.


838
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:41,006
So for more information you
can contact these poor guys


839
00:51:41,406 --> 00:51:45,966
or watch the video from
the earlier session


840
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:47,676
on automation over view.


841
00:51:48,136 --> 00:51:52,016
One more thing, this is a
very important day for us


842
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:56,856
because 20 years ago AppleScript
was given to the world.

845
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,586
In 1993 AppleScript released


846
00:52:05,586 --> 00:52:08,916
to the...I mean Apple released
AppleScript to the public


847
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:12,586
and since then it's become a
phenomenal language that people


848
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:16,806
and companies rely upon
to automate the processes


849
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:19,236
that they do, they build
their businesses on it,


850
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,326
they build their
careers on it and we want


851
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:24,546
to take this opportunity
on the 20th anniversary


852
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:27,386
to say thank you to
all of the developers


853
00:52:27,386 --> 00:52:30,366
that made their apps scriptable,
we want to say thank you


854
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:33,966
to all the scriptors who wrote
and write scripts everyday


855
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:35,356
and share them with others.


856
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:38,406
We want to thank our
customers for using AppleScript


857
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,506
and in addition we want to thank
all of the engineers that worked


858
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,866
on scriptable applications
and worked


859
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:45,866
at Apple in creating this.


860
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,766
We really appreciate
it, thank you so much.
