00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:29,346
>> Good evening.


4
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,906
My name is Robby Walker,
tonight I will be joined


5
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,376
by Brandon Newendorp and Corey
Peterson to talk about SiriKit.


6
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,906
First I'm going to start
by talking a little bit


7
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:42,016
about what SiriKit is, and at
a high level, how it works.


8
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,456
Then Brandon's going to talk
about building an extension


9
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:48,186
or two to connect your
application to SiriKit.


10
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,196
And then Corey's going to
talk about how to build


11
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:53,816
and design a great
conversational experience,


12
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,106
which is meaningfully different


13
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:57,356
than designing a great
graphical user interface.


14
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,206
But first, let's
talk about Siri.


15
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:00,906
Who is Siri?


16
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:07,816
Siri is your virtual assistant,
always ready to help you,


17
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:08,976
whether it's by adding
a bit of humor,


18
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,896
or much more frequently, by
helping you get things done,


19
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:19,376
and alerting you to potential
conflicts proactively.


20
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,076
We're going to talk about an
example app that integrates


21
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,436
with Siri, and when
we built this app,


22
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,646
we built a fake application.


23
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,646
So we wanted to name it
after something fake,


24
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,056
but we kind of felt like it was
really valuable so we wanted


25
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:34,346
to name it after a very
valuable sounding fake thing.


26
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,276
So we called it Unicorn Chat.


27
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,616
And then because we wanted it
to seem even more valuable,


28
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:41,976
we gave it a really sweet icon.


29

[ Applause ]


30
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:50,796
So you can imagine someone
saying something like, "Hey,


31
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,576
Siri, send a Unicorn
Chat message."


32
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,666
Siri might respond "To whom?"


33
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,006
Then you might say,
"Celestra", which is one


34
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,936
of the Unicorn names of
one of my colleagues.


35
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,216
Then you would -- then Siri
would ask, "What do you want


36
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,996
to say to Celestra, and then
I might say something like,


37
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,766
"Let's add more sparkle
transitions,"


38
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:08,846
because as everyone knows,


39
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,436
Unicorns love sparkle
transitions.


40
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,946
But there's a lot of ways to
say the same thing to Siri.


41
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,366
Someone else might say
it in just two steps,


42
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,916
saying something
like, "Send a message


43
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,316
to Celestra in Unicorn Chat."


44
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:24,586
And then of course, Siri
would ask a question


45
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,996
and then the user would fill
in the rest of their intent.


46
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,936
Other users might do the exact
same thing in only one line,


47
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,446
"Unicorn Chat Celestra, let's
add more sparkle transitions."


48
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:37,416
Somebody else might say an
equivalent concept in Chinese,


49
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:40,716
which I will not attempt to say.


50
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,516
And other users will be
incredibly polite and verbose,


51
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,486
and might say something
like, "Hey, Siri,


52
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,076
can you please do me a favor
and launch the Unicorn Chat app


53
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,926
to send a text with the
message let's add more


54
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:50,806
sparkle transitions."


55
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:54,326
And despite using 27 words
to describe a simple concept,


56
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:56,186
they actually forgot to
say who they were going


57
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:56,866
to send the message to.


58
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:00,836
And then even then, they
would be incredibly verbose


59
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:02,736
and say something like, "My
very best friend Celestra."


60
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,856
So the point is, there
are a lot of ways


61
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,276
to say the same thing to Siri.


62
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:10,146
And there are also a lot of
ways that Siri will respond.


63
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,686
So for example, if
you're holding your phone,


64
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,766
and you're pressing the
Home button, Siri's going


65
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:17,626
to provide more visual responses
and say less things out loud.


66
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,136
But if you're invoking
using Hey Siri,


67
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:23,156
like our friend Cookie Monster,
or if you're in the car,


68
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,676
Siri's going to say
more and show you less.


69
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,096
And the Siri experience is
also carefully optimized


70
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,666
to meet the accessibility
needs of our users and responds


71
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,016
to a lot of different
accessibility settings.


72
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,426
So in the end of the day,


73
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,436
there's basically a
combinatorial explosion of ways


74
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,746
that people use Siri,
both in terms


75
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,806
of how they phrase
something to Siri and in terms


76
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,226
of how Siri will respond.


77
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,216
And the question then becomes,


78
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,586
how do we make sure we're
building a high quality


79
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,756
experience for our users?


80
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:55,176
How do we make sure it's really
consistent across applications


81
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,056
within a single domain?


82
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,686
And most importantly, for
everyone in this room,


83
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,726
how do we make sure it's
nice and easy to adopt,


84
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,116
so that as many people as
possible can use as many


85
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,446
of their favorite applications
in a conversational way?


86
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:09,446
And the answer is that Siri
handles the conversation


87
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,936
and your application just
handles the functionality


88
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,276
So I'll go into a little more
detail about what that means.


89
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,906
The first thing that Siri does,


90
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,846
is understand what
the user said.


91
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,805
So we take audio and
we turn it into text.


92
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,226
Then we take that
text and we turn it


93
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,276
into a structured representation
of what the user is trying


94
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,216
to do, something
we call an intent.


95
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:32,386
Based on that intent, Siri then
takes action performing the task


96
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:33,676
the user wanted to accomplish.


97
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:37,006
And then Siri provides
responses as I said,


98
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,246
both visual and verbal.


99
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,406
And so there's a lot here.


100
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,446
There's a lot of work that
goes into these four steps.


101
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:44,506
There's a lot of deep
learning technologies.


102
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,866
There's convolutional
neural nets.


103
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,026
There's LSTMs, there's CRFs,


104
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,126
there's SVMs, there's
a lot here.


105
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:51,366
And we wanted to make sure
that as app developers,


106
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,316
you could really
focus on the things


107
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,596
that your app already does, and
there's three parts to that.


108
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:57,836
The first one is vocabulary.


109
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,136
This is how your application
tells Siri words Siri needs


110
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:01,666
to know about.


111
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,156
And Brandon will tell you
more about it in a bit.


112
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,326
The second one is app logic.


113
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,476
This is the functionality
of your application.


114
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,416
And then the last one is of
course, a great user interface.


115
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,186
So let's go through
this example again,


116
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,356
and see a little bit
about how it works.


117
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,916
So somebody says, "Hey Siri,


118
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,826
please send a Unicorn
Chat message to Celestra."


119
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,176
The first rule that your
application plays is


120
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:24,656
to help Siri understand
the speech.


121
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,746
So Siri doesn't have
the name Celestra


122
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,686
in its database,
but your app does.


123
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:31,836
So by sharing that information
with Siri, you make sure


124
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,216
that Siri understands
what the user said.


125
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,496
This also helps Siri
identify the fact


126
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:37,756
that Celestra is a contact


127
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,206
because when you provide
this kind vocabulary,


128
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,526
you will provide it by saying
these are names of contacts,


129
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,916
or in another example
it might be,


130
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,546
these are names of photo albums.


131
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:48,316
Now Siri understands that
in the messaging domain,


132
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,916
to send a message you
actually need more than,


133
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,926
of course, just a recipient.


134
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:51,816
You need a message.


135
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:55,016
And so Siri will quickly check
with your extension to ask,


136
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:57,916
"Do you actually require
content for this message?"


137
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,616
And if your application
says yes,


138
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,656
then Siri will ask a
follow up question.


139
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:04,096
So really that's all your
application has to do is sort


140
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,356
of specify on an individual
parameter basis what are


141
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:07,976
your constraints.


142
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,046
The next thing that happens
is Siri structures all


143
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:14,516
that information
up into an object.


144
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,806
So rather than having to
deal with all of the vagaries


145
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,336
of language and phrasing, and
all those things that we talked


146
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,736
about earlier, your application
really just gets this nice


147
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,426
simple object.


148
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:25,826
And then it hands off to your
application to help with,


149
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:29,896
you know, processing the intent
and performing the action.


150
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:30,816
And then of course,
along the way,


151
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,806
Siri provides a user
interface for the user.


152
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,026
And you have the option to
provide a second extension


153
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,976
to customize the user interface
to make it look extra Unicorny.


154
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,586
So that's a very, very high
level of how SiriKit works.


155
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,536
The idea was to make it
incredibly simple to adopt,


156
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,276
but still connect
you to the power


157
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,516
of conversational interactions.


158
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,266

am incredibly excited


164
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,326
to tell you all a little bit
more about how SiriKit works,


165
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,916
and how you're going to be
speaking Siri's language

00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,616
when you adopt SiriKit
in your own applications.


167

because this is some seriously


168
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:17,916
"intents" stuff.


169
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,956
To get started, I want to talk


170
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:23,916
about how SiriKit
communicates about the world.

00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,396
At a high level, Siri
thinks about everything


172
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,666
in the idea of a domain.


173
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,276
Where a domain is a
broad category of things


174
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:34,066
that Siri understands and
knows how to talk about.


175
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,996
For example, things like
messaging, placing VOIP calls,


176
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,246
and sending payments, are
great examples of domains,


177
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,926
and are some of the
domains that we are opening


178
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,026
up with SiriKit this year.


179
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,296
Within a domain,
we have an intent.


180
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,916
Where an intent describes
a known action


181
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,406
that Siri understands, and can
communicate to your application.


182
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,256
Now I'd like to break down
an intent a little bit more


183
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,656
with another example, in
a little bit more detail


184
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,116
than what Robby was
just talking about.


185
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,646
So in this case, we have
the Unicorn Pay app.


186
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,496
Hey Siri, send Buttercup
85 bucks


187
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,626
on Unicorn Pay for
rainbow polish.


188
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,916
Now Siri understands
that this is a request


189
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,286
in the payments domain.


190
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,076
And specifically,
we've recognized


191
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,196
that this is a send
payment intent.


192
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:22,226
Now every intent has
the idea of parameters.


193
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:26,356
Where parameters are specific
items that Siri can recognize,


194
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:29,516
understand, and communicate
to your application.


195
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,236
And there's a lot of parameters
on the send message intent.


196
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,596
We've recognized that
the app is Unicorn Pay,


197
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,025
and that the user is
trying to send the money


198
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,366
to someone named Buttercup.


199
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:44,566
We've also recognized an amount
of 85, and then Siri is going


200
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,816
to be very smart, and recognize
that when the user said "bucks,"


201
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,696
they probably meant US Dollars.


202
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:52,616
And Siri can use a lot
of powerful capabilities


203
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,826
to understand what we think the
user means in a case like this,


204
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,206
basing it on things like
the user's location,


205
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,386
their Siri locale, and
other information available


206
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,116
to our system.


207
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,826
And finally, we recognize
that the user is asking


208
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,976
to send a payment
for rainbow polish.


209
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,286
So there's this common language
that we've created for Sirikit,


210
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:17,686
of intents that describe
actions and intent responses


211
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,636
that are used to
describe results coming


212
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,926
from your application
back to Siri.


213
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:26,836
So let's talk a little
bit more about an intent.


214
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,596
As I said, an intent
is an action


215
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,366
that we're asking your app
to perform, and something


216
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,256
that we can communicate


217
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,736
about between Apple
and your application.


218
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,226
Every intent will have zero to
many parameters, and it's going


219
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,766
to vary based on the
individual intent and domain,


220
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,086
and what Siri understands
within that domain,


221
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,046
and what we think is relevant to
communicate to your application.


222
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,476
And no matter what, an intent
will always be classified


223
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,216
into a domain.


224
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,056
So this is something
you want to think


225
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,796
about when you're getting
started with adopting SiriKit


226
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,686
in your application, is look
at the domains that are a part


227
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,086
of SiriKit, and think
about which ones are going


228
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,976
to make the most sense
for your application.


229
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,996
Now we also have
intent responses.


230
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,646
And these are how you tell Siri
about the results of the intent


231
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,366
that your app just performed.


232
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,266
You're always going
to use one of these


233
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,566
to communicate the result


234
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:21,816
because there's always an intent
response paired with its intent.


235
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,856
Intent responses also can have
parameters attached to them,


236
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:29,356
which are used to describe
what your app actually did


237
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,116
with that intent.


238
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,346
Sometimes those parameters are
going to be the same as the one


239
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,526
on the intent, and other
times they'll be different


240
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,416
because there's something
that's only communicated


241
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,306
from your app back to Siri.


242
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:44,246
We also accept a response code
attached to an intent response.


243
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,926
These are used to tell
Siri at a broad level


244
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,816
about whether your app was able
to complete the request or not,


245
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,486
and there's default ones,
such as success, or failure,


246
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,616
or failure that requires
an app launch.


247
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,616
Some intents and domains have
more specific error codes.


248
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:04,396
It's very important that you
tell Siri an accurate response


249
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,326
code back for your application
because we're going to use this


250
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:10,156
to drive dialogue and make
a better user experience


251
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,486
for all of your users.


252
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,596
Finally, we have an
NSUserActivity attached


253
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,526
to an intent response.


254
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,556
Now if you're already supporting
hand off in your application,


255
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,426
you're familiar with
NSUserActivity.


256
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,026
We use NSUserActivities
to launch your application


257
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,296
if the user needs to leave
the Siri experience and move


258
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,286
onto your application.


259
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,206
Now by default, Siri is going to
generate our own user activity


260
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:36,716
with the intent and
intent response to give


261
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:39,316
to your application, so
that you can pick up exactly


262
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,676
where you left off from Siri.


263
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,186
If you'd like to, you can
provide your own user activity,


264
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,256
and populate the
user info dictionary


265
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,546
with information that's
unique to your application.


266
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,356
Just to make sure you create
the best possible experience


267
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:55,136
when users leave Siri and
move on to your application.


268
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,836
So those are intents,
and intent responses.


269
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,176
They're the fundamental
language that Siri uses to talk


270
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,266
to your application


271
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,086
and understand what your
application was able to perform


272
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:06,976
on behalf of the user.


273
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,116
The next thing I'd like to
talk about, is how your app


274
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:17,796
and Siri are going to
communicate about intents.


275
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,996
Now there's three steps
that we're going to ask you


276
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,406
to go through, while
communicating about intents.


277
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,366
The first of those is resolve.


278
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,016
We're going to ask your app


279
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,476
to resolve every
parameter on an intent.


280
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,396
And in fact, we will call
resolve multiple times


281
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,226
for every parameter and
sometimes multiple times


282
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:37,516
for the same parameter
until you and the user agree


283
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:38,656
on what they requested.


284
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,866
The second step is confirm,
which is a chance for your app


285
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:45,206
to make sure that it's going to
be able to handle the intent,


286
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,196
and tell us about
the expected outcome.


287
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,536
And finally, most
importantly, is the handle step,


288
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:53,646
where you perform the specific
action the user asked you to do.


289
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:56,976
Let's talk a little bit more
about the resolve stages first.


290
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,506
The purpose of the
resolve stage,


291
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,196
is for you to help Siri
understand what the user said,


292
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,726
and more importantly,
what the user meant


293
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,676
when they started asking a
request of your application.


294
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:14,006
This is also your
app's big opportunity


295
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:17,056
to influence Siri's behavior
and have some control


296
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,146
over the conversation
that we're having


297
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,856
with the user of
your application.


298
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,406
In order to do that,
your app is going


299
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,726
to provide a resolution
response.


300
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:29,426
And there's a number of
different resolution responses


301
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,916
for every type of data that
Siri understands, and is going


302
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,636
to ask your app to
help us understand.


303
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:36,756
So let's go back to our example


304
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:39,236
with sending Buttercup
some money on Unicorn Pay


305
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,696
for that rainbow polish.


306
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:43,786
And specifically, I'd
like to go pay attention


307
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,966
to the payee field.


308
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:48,046
This is used to describe
who we are sending money to.


309
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:52,316
And it's important that
Siri, the user, and your app,


310
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,496
all agree on what the user
meant when they said Buttercup.


311
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:59,156
Now hopefully, the most
common resolution response


312
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:00,916
from your app will be success.


313
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:04,036
Which means that you understood
exactly what the user said,


314
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,686
what they specified, and
then you're going to tell us


315
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:10,376
that you successfully understood
that and provide the object back


316
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,386
to us to tell us
what you resolved to,


317
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,806
what you successfully matched.


318
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,036
In this case, it means


319
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,956
that Unicorn Pay totally
understood who Buttercup was.


320
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,816
Now sometimes, your app is going
to make some smart choices,


321
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,146
but it wants to make sure


322
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:26,906
that the user really meant what
you think you'd made a smart


323
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:27,506
choice about.


324
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:30,276
So we have a confirmation
required option.


325
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,206
This is where you can ask Siri


326
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:36,256
to have the user double
check your resolution result,


327
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:38,366
and provide a yes
or a no response.


328
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,996
So in this case, for Unicorn
Pay, Siri's just making sure


329
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,366
that the user meant
Sir Buttercup


330
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:43,976
when they said Buttercup.


331
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:49,276
Now there's other times that
your app is going to need


332
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,836
to ask the user to pick from
a short list of options.


333
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,576
And Siri calls this
disambiguation.


334
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,926
If you'd like to ask the user
to pick from a list of options,


335
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,156
we recommend five
to ten at most.


336
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,346
You can provide a
disambiguation list to Siri.


337
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,776
And then we'll present the
options you told us about.


338
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,126
In the case of this Unicorn Pay
example, we're asking the user


339
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,536
if they meant Sir Buttercup,


340
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,306
Buttercup the Bold,
or Sunrise Buttercup?


341
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,866
Now one of the powerful parts
of Siri, is that we're going


342
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:20,036
to take care of the interaction
with the user on behalf of you.


343
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,676
You don't have to
worry about this part.


344
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:24,986
So users can use a
natural way to select one


345
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,036
of these options with Siri.


346
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,586
They could tap on an item in the
list, they could speak the name


347
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,616
and say "Sir Buttercup", or
they could just refer to one


348
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,336
and simply say, "the
second one."


349
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,176
And no matter how the user
wants to interact with Siri,


350
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,126
we're going to take care of that
for your application for free.


351
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,976
Now there's other times that
you need more information


352
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:45,626
from the user.


353
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,236
Maybe they weren't
specific enough,


354
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,426
or maybe your application has
80 people named Buttercup,


355
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,276
and you don't want
to present 80 options


356
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,426
of Buttercup to the user.


357
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,676
In these cases, you can say
that you need more details,


358
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,746
and Siri will prompt the
user to be more specific.


359
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:01,746
Once the user provides
more input,


360
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,546
we'll call the resolve
method again.


361
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:08,896
If the user didn't specify a
value, and you need one in order


362
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,266
to proceed, you can tell
Siri that you need a value.


363
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,676
And in this case, we'll
tell the user, "Hey,


364
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,776
you've got to say something
for this because, you know,


365
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,796
Unicorn Pay needs to know
who you're sending money to."


366
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:22,706
You can also tell us that you
don't understand the input the


367
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:25,576
user provided, and that you
need a completely new value.


368
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,006
And for that we have
unsupported with reason.


369
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:31,046
And just tell us, you don't
support this particular value,


370
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,156
and Siri will ask the
user for a new one.


371
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:38,236
And finally, if there's a value
that if a parameter is given,


372
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:41,646
and your app doesn't require it,
or need it, just tell Siri that.


373
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,676
We won't prompt the user for
it, and if the user happens


374
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,116
to specify a value,
we'll simply ignore them.


375
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,326
So those are the resolve steps.


376
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:54,496
It's how we make sure that
Siri, your app, and the user,


377
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:57,106
all agree on what they're
asking your application


378
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,686
to do before we move on.


379
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,706
The next step is confirm.


380
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:06,046
So the confirm stage is
really about two things.


381
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,346
First, it's a chance
for you to tell Siri


382
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,356
about the expected result
of handling an intent.


383
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,786
We will want you to
provide this response


384
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,226
that we can tell the user
what's going to happen.


385
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,556
It's also an opportunity
for your app


386
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,665
to check any required state
that it might need in order


387
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,116
to complete the request
that the user is asking for.


388
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,416
Now no matter what, you're going


389
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,616
to provide an intent response
back from the confirm step,


390
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,746
and we want you to populate as
much information as you can,


391
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,706
in that intent response,
so that we can communicate


392
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,556
that to the user
very effectively.


393
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:45,056
And sometimes, Siri is going to
prompt the user for confirmation


394
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:48,156
for certain intents and certain
domains where we've decided


395
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,026
that that's important.


396
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:52,786
For example, things like sending
payments, or requesting rides,


397
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,756
are things that Siri's
going to confirm


398
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:57,406
with the user before we
move onto the next step.


399
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,006
So let's think about what
we're going to confirm


400
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,526
in the Unicorn Pay example.


401
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,566
Now Unicorn Pay has to be
able to talk to our service,


402
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,636
make sure the user signed in,
and a number of other things


403
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,896
in order to complete a request.


404
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,916
So we're going to check all
of those in the confirm step.


405
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:15,156
We're going to say, "Can we
reach the Unicorn Pay servers?


406
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,756
Is the user signed
in to Unicorn Pay?"


407
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,056
And of course, this is
expensive rainbow polish,


408
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,806
so we want to make sure
the user has enough money


409
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,766
in their account before
we send this payment.


410
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,706
Once we've made sure
that our app is able


411
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,856
to handle this request, we
generate an intent response


412
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:34,346
with a success result code,
and then pass it back to Siri


413
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,126
so we can move onto
the final step.


414
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:40,466
And that's the confirm stage
of dealing with an intent.


415
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,606
The final step is handle.


416
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:47,216
And this is the most important
part of working with an intent,


417
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,856
because at this point,
you're going to do the thing


418
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,066
that the user asked you to do.


419
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,596
You're going to perform the
action on behalf of the user.


420
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,986
And just like in the
confirm step, it's important


421
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,876
that you provide
as much information


422
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:02,286
as you have available back
to Siri, because we want all


423
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:05,636
of that information so that we
can create the best possible


424
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,166
user experience for all
of your app's users.


425
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,946
Sometimes we're going to display
this information visually,


426
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,596
and other times we're
going to use it as part


427
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,966
of the conversation and
speak it back to the user,


428
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,916
so that they understand
what your app did.


429
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:23,646
Now we understand that sometimes
your app might need a little bit


430
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:26,346
of time to complete a
request on behalf of the user.


431
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,676
Networking calls might take a
while, or maybe there's a human


432
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,466
on the other end of your
service that's, you know,


433
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,126
processing transactions
or something.


434
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,356
While we're waiting for a
response back from your app,


435
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:39,776
were going to show a
waiting UI to the user,


436
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,056
and say that your app
is currently handling


437
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:43,006
their request.


438
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,226
We really would like you
to provide a response


439
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:48,936
within a few seconds, two
to three seconds at most.


440
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:52,236
And ideally, you can get
back to us with a success


441
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,566
in a very short amount of time.


442
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,746
However, if you know
that your app is going


443
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:59,396
to take a little while to get
back to the user with a result,


444
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,576
we'd like you to send an
in progress response code.


445
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,176
This allows Siri
to tell the user


446
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:08,446
that your app has received the
request with as much information


447
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:10,816
as you've told us about, and
that it's going to continue


448
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:13,566
to process the request
even if they leave Siri.


449
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,726
So in the case of our
Unicorn Pay example,


450
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,906
as soon as we get the handle
step, we're going to talk


451
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,996
to our servers, we're
going to send the payment,


452
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,466
and then give Siri an intent
response with a success code


453
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:28,286
so that Siri can tell the
user their money is safely


454
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:28,806
on the way.


455
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,986
And that's what involved
in how we talk


456
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,926
to your application
with SiriKit.


457
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:37,396
We have intents,
and intent responses


458
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,216
that are creating
this common language


459
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,326
between your app and Siri.


460
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:44,736
The next thing we're going to
talk about is what's involved


461
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:45,976
in adding SiriKit
to your application.


462
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,656
So with SiriKit in iOS 10,


463
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,966
we're creating two
new extension points.


464
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,626
An intents extension, and
an intents UI extension.


465
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,616
I told you this was
some intents stuff.


466
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,526
We also are adding some API


467
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:07,776
to help you help Siri recognize
what the user is saying


468
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:08,766
for your application.


469
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,496
And we're going that in form


470
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,936
of what we call app
vocabulary, and user vocabulary.


471
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,586
I'd like to get started
by talking


472
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,376
about the intents extension.


473
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,936
This is what's going to
implement the resolve, confirm,


474
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:25,356
and handle methods that we
were just talking about.


475
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:29,456
Now, at its core, the intents
extension is the most important


476
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,166
fundamental part of SiriKit.


477
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,616
This is what we build all
of our interactions off


478
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:36,246
of between Siri and
your application.


479
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:41,086
Your intents extension can
support one or more intents,


480
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,936
and we leave it up to you to
decide what makes the most sense


481
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,886
for your app and how you'd like
to implement your extensions.


482
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:49,666
Now we encourage you to minimize
the number of extensions


483
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,886
so that we aren't
launching as many processes


484
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,426
if the user makes multiple
requests to your application.


485
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:56,496
But do what makes sense for you.


486
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,436
It's also important to realize,


487
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,536
that your intent
extension is going to run


488
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:04,156
in the background while
Siri is in the foreground.


489
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:07,906
This allows Siri to maintain
a conversation with the user,


490
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,756
and still talk to your app
to get data back and forth


491
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:13,326
and communicate about
the user's request.


492
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:17,766
And as I mentioned, your intent
extension is what's implementing


493
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:21,486
the resolve, confirm, and
handle methods for every intent


494
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:22,736
that your app supports.


495
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:27,866
Now when we built SiriKit, we
put a lot of time into thinking


496
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:30,236
about security, because
security is fundamental


497
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,856
to everything we do at Apple.


498
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,666
Part of Siri's built in
behavior is that we're going


499
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,396
to restrict certain behaviors


500
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:40,446
from being taken while
the device is locked.


501
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:44,026
For example, we wanted to
make sure users authenticate


502
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:46,636
into their device and unlock
it before they send a payment


503
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,466
or request a ridesharing
vehicle.


504
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,536
And that's a built in behavior
we have for certain intents.


505
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,716
Now we also understand that
there are some behaviors


506
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:58,456
that your app would like to
increase that security for.


507
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,366
By default, Siri's
going to allow things


508
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:03,016
like sending messages
from the lock screen,


509
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:06,126
but if your app would like to
ensure that the user has logged


510
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,696
into their device first, you
can tell Siri that you would


511
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,866
like to increase our
default security,


512
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,366
and restrict your
intent while locked.


513
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:17,206
And this is simply done
through an info plist key.


514
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,826
We've also worked to make sure


515
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:21,076
that the local authentication
framework is available


516
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:24,056
for your intent extension,
so that you can ask the user


517
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,556
for additional authentication,


518
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,906
even while the device
is already unlocked.


519
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:30,766
If you're not familiar with the
local authentication framework,


520
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:33,846
there's a great talk from 2014
that goes into more detail.


521
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:38,336
And finally, we've made sure
that Apple Pay is available


522
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:39,456
for your intent extension.


523
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,506
So if you'd like to complete
a transaction using Apple Pay


524
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,196
with your users,
that's available


525
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:46,886
to your intent extension and
the Apple Pay sheet will appear


526
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:47,966
right above Siri.


527
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,126
If you'd like to
learn more about this,


528
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,836
I'm glad someone
uses Apply Pay here.


529
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:54,286
I'm excited about it.


530
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,136
You can learn more in the
What's New with Wallet


531
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,436
and Apple Pay talk that
just took place yesterday.


532
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,216
So that's your intent extension.


533
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,586
This is a fundamental part of
SiriKit and it's how we're going


534
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:08,026
to communicate with your app
to complete the users request.


535
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:12,096
The next piece is your
intents UI extension.


536
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:13,946
Let's go into a little
bit more detail


537
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,306
about what that's all about.


538
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:19,836
So the intents UI intent
extension is a chance


539
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:22,676
to bring your app's interface
into the Siri experience,


540
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,576
and make Siri really feel


541
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,376
like your users are
using your application.


542
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,986
You can bring your brand,
your visual identity,


543
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:33,076
as well as other information
into the Siri transcript.


544
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,186
And you do that by
adding these views


545
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,706
to what we call a Siri snippet.


546
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,156
Your intents UI extension
is always going


547
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,056
to return a UI view controller.


548
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,546
And you can add anything you'd


549
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,986
like inside that
view controller.


550
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:48,816
Now it's completely optional to
have an intents UI extension.


551
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,716
By default, Siri has an
interface for every intent


552
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,466
that we support in SiriKit.


553
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:57,456
And we think that those will
effectively communicate all


554
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,066
of the pieces of information
your user wants to know about,


555
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:03,226
but if you'd like to make a more
unique and branded experience,


556
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:04,676
this is your opportunity.


557
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,866
We've also made intents
UI extensions available


558
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:09,846
for certain intents.


559
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,066
Where we think it makes sense to
show an interface to the user.


560
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,776
So there's a number
of things you can do


561
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,146
with an intents UI extension.


562
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,366
You've used it to show
additional information that goes


563
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,986
above and beyond
what's described


564
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,026
in the intent and
intent response.


565
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,696
Maybe some information that's
unique to your application.


566
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,216
You can also use it to update
the user with the status


567
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,466
of a long running intent.


568
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:35,166
So if you've provided an
in progress response code,


569
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,576
as we mentioned earlier,
you could continue


570
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,876
to update the user about
the status of that intent


571
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:42,896
in your intents UI extension.


572
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,946
Now no matter what,
we're always going


573
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:49,306
to show your intents UI
extension alongside other


574
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,056
Siri content.


575
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,726
So we're always going to
show what your app icon


576
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,646
and app name at the
top in a sash.


577
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,576
We may choose to show some
buttons and other information


578
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:58,606
at the bottom of the snippet,


579
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,966
as well as other
pieces of information.


580
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:04,586
Your view controller is always
part of our Siri snippet.


581
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,836
Now there's a couple of
cases where it makes sense


582
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,116
for your app to replace
the content


583
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,646
that we're showing
in Siri by default.


584
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:16,636
And this is things like
messages, or maps, where we felt


585
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:18,226
that you should have
the opportunity


586
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:21,876
to replace the default messaging
or maps experience with the one


587
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,556
that you feel suits your
app and your users best.


588
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,936
So you can tell us that your
displaying a map or a message


589
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,336
with your intents UI extension,


590
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,216
and then we will omit certain
Siri interface elements


591
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:33,426
in favor of yours.


592
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:36,546
Now it's also important
to keep in mind,


593
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:39,446
that just like the new
notifications extensions,


594
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:42,276
intent UI extensions
are non-interactive.


595
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,486
So you can draw anything you'd
like, you can put animations,


596
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,456
you can play any kind
of views you would like,


597
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,686
but we would discourage
you from putting controls


598
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,236
in your UI extension,
because users will not be able


599
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,056
to interact with them.


600
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,446
So that's the intents
UI extension.


601
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:01,346
Together these two extension
points are everything you need


602
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,786
to add your app's
capabilities to Siri,


603
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:07,596
and bring your experience and
your user interface inside Siri


604
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,956
to make a better experience
for all of your users.


605
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,756
The next two parts of SiriKit,


606
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:14,586
are all part of your
application.


607
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:16,976
So let's talk about what
those all involve next.


608
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,346
Now, all of the responsibilities
for your application lie


609
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,926
in the area of vocabulary.


610
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,166
All of your applications
have unique ways of talking


611
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,756
to your customers, and that
your customers use to refer


612
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,346
to features of your application.


613
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,956
And Siri needs a
little bit of your help


614
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:40,656
in understanding the things
that users are going to say


615
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,096
to your app, and the things


616
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,696
that they're accustomed
to talking about.


617
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:47,256
Some of these phrases are
part of your application.


618
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:48,666
They're things that every user


619
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,706
of your app knows
and understands.


620
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:54,566
Other phrases are going to be
unique to individual users,


621
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:56,906
and we have the API to
support both of these as part


622
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,076
of SiriKit, and both
are very important


623
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,866
to making a great experience.


624
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,606
Let's dig into app
specific vocabulary first.


625
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:08,116
These are words or phrases that
are part of your application,


626
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:11,306
and they're known to every
user of your application.


627
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:14,076
They're things like workout
names or vehicle types


628
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,546
that everyone uses to refer to
certain features of your app.


629
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:21,396
Now because they're part of your
application, you define these


630
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,186
in a plist that's part
of your main app bundle.


631
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:27,006
And also, because they're
part of your main app bundle,


632
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:28,986
we encourage you
to localize these,


633
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:31,286
so that they can be
supported for every locale


634
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:33,596
that your app supports,
and every locale


635
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,036
that Siri's going to be using.


636
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,916
Let's talk about what goes
into that vocabulary plist,


637
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,916
because there's a number of
parts to a vocabulary plist.


638
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,246
The first of them, are
examples of how users are going


639
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,646
to talk to your application.


640
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,666
These are kind of
what we call, like,


641
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,296
your hero use cases
for your app.


642
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,226
In the case of our new Unicorn
Fit app, it'd be an example


643
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,136
like start a workout
with Unicorn Fit.


644
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:59,756
The common things that
you think users will say


645
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:00,866
to talk to your app.


646
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,656
Now in addition to that,
there are certain parameters


647
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:07,016
where you can provide
your own vocabulary types.


648
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,456
For the Unicorn Fit application,


649
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:12,496
we're going to specify our
own unique workout names.


650
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:16,416
Some things that are unique
and unique to Unicorn Fit,


651
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,166
but known to all of our users.


652
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:22,196
Now I'm sure you all are very
avid users of Unicorn Fit,


653
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,266
but if you're not, now
we're going to learn


654
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,666
about the term Colorlicious.


655
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:28,736
It's a particular workout
name, and it describes a thing


656
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:29,806
where you run around
and you catch bits


657
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,496
of falling glitter
as fast as possible.


658
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:32,266
It's a great workout.


659
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,296
You should all give it a try.


660
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:34,216
It's a new craze.


661
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:37,946
So we're going to tell Siri
about the phrase "Colorlicious."


662
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:39,846
It's a unique term for our app.


663
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:43,466
Now, sometimes these phrases
are not the easiest things


664
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:43,976
to pronounce.


665
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,726
They don't look very obvious.


666
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,346
So you're also going
to give Siri some


667
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,646
pronunciation information.


668
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:53,296
And this is just a simple
phonetics spelling of the word


669
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,006
or phrase that you're
telling Siri about.


670
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,916
And finally, provide some
examples of how you're going


671
00:29:58,916 --> 00:29:59,976
to use that phrase in your app.


672
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:03,396
"Do a Colorlicious in Unicorn
Fit", would be an example


673
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,136
of this particular
vocabulary entry.


674
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:10,836
The other type of vocabulary,
is user specific vocabulary.


675
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,896
These are words or
phrases that are unique


676
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,296
to individual users
of your application.


677
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,986
And because they're unique to
individual users of your app,


678
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,616
we're asking you to
provide them at runtime


679
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:24,296
from your main application.


680
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:27,236
We ask you to provide
these in the form


681
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:29,526
of an ordered set of terms.


682
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,396
Now you might be thinking,
and ordered set is kind


683
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:33,796
of an odd data structure choice.


684
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,226
Why would we be choosing
to use that?


685
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,606
Well I promise you there's
a really good reason for it.


686
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,266
We really, we really want you --


687
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:45,686
we'd encourage you to order
the vocabulary in a priority


688
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:48,796
for your users, with the most
important terms or the things


689
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:51,226
that you think users will
say the most up front.


690
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:54,126
Let's talk about that in
the context of Unicorn Pay,


691
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,446
where we have an address book


692
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,076
of everyone we can
send payments to.


693
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,196
Now we want you to give Siri
the names of all of the contacts


694
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,866
in your application, so that
if the user says those names,


695
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,416
we'll be able to recognize them.


696
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:09,256
However, Unicorn Pay
keeps track of the people


697
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:10,746
that we've paid most recently.


698
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,776
So we're going to put
our recent contacts ahead


699
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:15,696
of all the other contacts
in our application.


700
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:20,266
In addition to that, Unicorn
Pay has a set of favorites,


701
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,726
which are the most
important people to the user.


702
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,796
So we're going to
prioritize those first,


703
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,336
and start off our ordered
set with our favorites,


704
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:30,466
followed by our recent
contacts, and then wrapping it


705
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,366
up with the other
contacts at the end.


706
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,566
And by prioritizing in this way,


707
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:37,946
your helping Siri better
understand your users


708
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:40,146
and make a better
experience for everyone


709
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,406
who uses your app with Siri.


710
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,956
There's a few types of
things that we support


711
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:48,066
with user vocabulary, and those
are things like contact names,


712
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,336
workout names, photo
albums or photo keywords.


713
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,976
And as an added benefit
to your application,


714
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:58,146
if you rely on the system iOS
address book, you don't need


715
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,186
to worry about this part
at all for contact names,


716
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:02,136
because Siri has a
built in understanding


717
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,206
of the system address book.


718
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:05,536
So you only need to
provide contact names


719
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,976
if your app keeps its own
dedicated address book.


720
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,636
Now, you also should think about
what information you're giving


721
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:17,066
to Siri as part of this
vocabulary mechanism,


722
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:19,076
and only tell us
about information


723
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,356
that you your users
would expect Siri


724
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,026
to recognize and know about.


725
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,046
So we don't want you to give
us things like phone numbers,


726
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:28,476
or e-mail addresses in
your vocabulary data.


727
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:32,796
Just give us simple common
things like your contact names,


728
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:35,746
the things that users would
expect to see come from Siri.


729
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:39,696
Now it's important that
you update Siri promptly


730
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:44,116
as data changes, because users
are accustomed to saying things


731
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,536
to Siri the instant they
put them into their phone.


732
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,266
So for example, if the
user creates a new contact


733
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,756
in your app, make sure you
tell Siri about that as soon


734
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:52,826
as they hit the save button.


735
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:56,326
That way we can ingest the data,
and be ready to recognize it


736
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:59,246
as soon as users hold down the
home button and talk to Siri.


737
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:03,636
It's even more important
that you delete information


738
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:05,276
from your Siri vocabulary
promptly,


739
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,606
because your users
would be very unhappy


740
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,776
if they deleted something
from your application,


741
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:12,666
and then Siri was still
recognizing it a few days


742
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,256
or a few weeks later, because
you forgot to tell Siri


743
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:17,916
that the user deleted that
particular piece of information.


744
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,856
And finally, make sure
that you remove all


745
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,716
of your vocabulary data from
Siri if the user chooses


746
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:27,156
to reset your application,
or log out.


747
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:32,386
Now the other piece of SiriKit
has to do with permissions.


748
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:35,276
So like many other parts of iOS,


749
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:38,296
users have to approve
authorization


750
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,706
for your app to talk to Siri.


751
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,456
And we do this through
the standard TCC alerts


752
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,656
that you're used to
seeing for things


753
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:45,496
like the camera,
or the microphone.


754
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:49,816
Now your app is able to
provide a string that goes


755
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:52,456
into this alert to
tell users what kind


756
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:55,086
of information your app is
going to be sending to Siri.


757
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:59,046
This is also a fantastic
opportunity to teach your users


758
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,196
about what your app does,


759
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,566
and what cool new features
you've just created


760
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,846
for all of them.


761
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:08,096
We also are encouraging
you to request permission


762
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,755
from your app the first
time a user uses it


763
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,706
after they upgrade to iOS 10.


764
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:15,996
We want you to do that so
that users know about Siri


765
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,146
and have approved the use


766
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:19,706
of Siri before they make
their first request.


767
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:22,735
So as soon as they try talking
to Siri, and your application,


768
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:25,216
it's already approved, and
they have a fantastic first


769
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:25,966
launch experience.


770
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:30,036
So that's what's involved


771
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,746
in adding SiriKit
to your application.


772
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,775
These two pieces of extensions,
these two new extensions,


773
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,726
and two vocabulary mechanisms.


774
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,036
The last thing I would like to
talk about is how SiriKit fits


775
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:46,216
into the larger world of iOS.


776
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:48,795
Now Siri is an integral part
of our operating system.


777
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:52,396
It's always accessible to
the user via the home button,


778
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:54,976
via hey Siri, via
headset microphones


779
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,795
and many other ways
of triggering Siri.


780
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:59,666
And SiriKit is just as integral


781
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,726
to the operating
system as Siri itself.


782
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:07,236
Now Siri integration is part of
this larger intense framework


783
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,396
that we've created
this year, which is all


784
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:13,416
about communicating these common
and shared actions and intents


785
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,986
between your app and iOS.


786
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:19,536
And the intense framework
is going beyond just Siri


787
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,396
integration this year.


788
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:22,896
It's part of the
contacts integration,


789
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,226
where you can donate
information to the system,


790
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:29,016
and elevate your application
to be the default messaging


791
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:32,086
or telephoning mechanism
for certain contacts.


792
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,196
We've also done very deep
integration with CallKit,


793
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:38,046
to make a great VOIP experience.


794
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,426
The most, the biggest
piece of this is with maps.


795
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:45,506
Maps is adding ridesharing
to iOS 10,


796
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:48,376
where you can book a ride right
within the maps application.


797
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,276
Now we worked very
closely with the maps team


798
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,616
to create a common
extension point.


799
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,406
This intense extension and
ridesharing intents are used


800
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,066
for Siri, and maps, to
create the same experience.


801
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:05,676
So if you adopt SiriKit and the
intents extensions, you're going


802
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,566
to get the maps integration
for free.


803
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,616
We think this is a great
way to save you some time,


804
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:13,786
and make an even better
developer and user experience.


805
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:20,876
[ Applause ]


806
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,146
The last part I'd
like to talk about,


807
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,486
is how users talk
to your application.


808
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,496
Now it's very important
as part of our security


809
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,576
and privacy model of iOS


810
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:33,096
and making your customers
comfortable with your app


811
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,836
and your data, it's important
that they understand when a --


812
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,646
they're going to be talking
to your specific application


813
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:42,566
and when their data
is going to your app.


814
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,036
To make sure that all
of your users know that,


815
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,976
users are required to
say the name of your app


816
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:50,116
when making a request to Siri.


817
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:52,396
Specifically, we're
going to be looking


818
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,676
at your bundle display name.


819
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,456
This is what's shown
on the home screen,


820
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,396
underneath your app
icon, to your users.


821
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,286
Now Siri's all about
natural language


822
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:03,646
and having a comfortable fluid
conversation with the user.


823
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,716
So to make sure that that's
part of how this works,


824
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:10,496
users are able to say your app
name in many parts of speech,


825
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:13,126
at the beginning, or the end
of an utterance, in the middle,


826
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:16,426
wherever it fits in
naturally, because Siri wants


827
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:19,116
to make a natural fluid
experience for talking


828
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:20,716
to your app, and to your users.


829
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,016
One of the common
things that users do


830
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:26,886
with SiriKit is what we
call verbing the app name,


831
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,686
or taking your app name
and using it as a verb


832
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,426
to describe a particular action.


833
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,986
As an example of
that, they might say,


834
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:37,106
"Unicorn Chat Celestra order
five rainbow rolls please."


835
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,666
And in this case, they're
using Unicorn Chat as the verb,


836
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,116
describing the action
they're asking us to take.


837
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:46,236
And this will, of course, work
fantastically well with Siri.


838
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,676
In fact, there's a multitude
of ways that users can talk


839
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,496
to your app using Siri.


840
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,346
The possibilities are endless.


841
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,356
So that's what's involved


842
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,536
in implementing a great Siri
experience for your users.


843
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,236
But there's more than just
engineering implantation


844
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,006
involved in creating a
good Siri experience.


845
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:06,236
And to tell you more


846
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:08,036
about designing a
great Siri experience,


847
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:10,976
I'd like to invite Buttercup,
my co-worker Corey, on stage.


848
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:15,566
[ Applause ]


849
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:16,446
>> Thank you.


850
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:19,786
Hello everyone.


851
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:22,456
I'm Corey Peterson, and
I'm a designer on Siri,


852
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,006
and I'm very excited
to talk to you


853
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:26,976
about creating magical
experiences with SiriKit.


854
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,826
I've got three things I
want to talk about today.


855
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,566
The first is some of the
things that Siri does for you


856
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:41,116
to help facilitate the
conversation with your users.


857
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:45,416
Next, we'll go through
some design guidelines


858
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,306
that you should keep in mind as
you start to work with SiriKit.


859
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,646
And then, I'll give a few
tips of what you can do


860
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,776
to polish the design, and take
your app to the next level.


861
00:38:56,536 --> 00:39:00,436
So, let's get started
with user interface.


862
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,016
Now when I say user interface,
you're probably thinking


863
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:05,446
about something like this.


864
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,066
A button. Part of
a visual interface


865
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:11,506
that appears on screen.


866
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:15,536
Now visual interfaces have
well understood behaviors


867
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,976
and patterns and


868
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,956
and everyone is pretty
familiar with using those.


869
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:24,826
It's part of an application,


870
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:28,116
and that application gives the
context of what you're trying --


871
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,196
the user is trying to do,


872
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,546
the options that
they have available,


873
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,346
and the details about
those elements.


874
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,726
And there's pretty much one
way to interact with a button.


875
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:42,996
But, as you start to work with
conversation things change,


876
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,866
and one of the biggest
differences is


877
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,996
that button is gone.


878
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:52,636
Now, it can be -- feel
strange not having information


879
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:53,466
on a screen.


880
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,496
So how do we solve this?


881
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:59,186
Because the user could
say whatever they want,


882
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,286
or they might not
even know what to say.


883
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,776
So we like to think of it as
a conversational interface.


884
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:10,886
The context of what's
happening is established


885
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:14,206
through the conversation
between the person,


886
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,016
Siri, and now your apps.


887
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:23,106
Now, without a visual reference,
the user, or the person has


888
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,846
to keep all this
information in their head.


889
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,096
So Siri works hard to prevent --


890
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:30,616
to present just the
relevant critical information


891
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,986
to get a task done, and
not overwhelm them with all


892
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:34,926
of the other information.


893
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:42,376
And, this interface is shaped by
the questions and the responses,


894
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:44,366
both from the person
and from Siri.


895
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:46,286
And it's important to think


896
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:49,516
about how Siri asks
and responds.


897
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:52,176
And your application
has the ability


898
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,196
to shape this conversation.


899
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:56,166
And we'll talk about
that a little bit later.


900
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,296
So let's go through an
example of how this can work.


901
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:03,206
Let's say, someone
has created a message,


902
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,906
and Siri might say
something like,


903
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:12,736
>> Ready to send it?


904
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,746
>> Now people can say a lot
of different things here.


905
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,516
They might simply say "send it."


906
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:20,996
Or they might decide not to,


907
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:24,176
or they might ignore
the question entirely,


908
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,076
and say whatever they want.


909
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:28,256
And that's okay.


910
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,136
These are actually appropriate
responses in this situation.


911
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:34,336
And the great thing is, Siri's
going to take care of this


912
00:41:34,336 --> 00:41:37,826
for you, and send the right
information back to your app.


913
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,076
And even better than that,
Siri will handle the thousands


914
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:42,976
of other ways that people
may say the same thing.


915
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:51,886
Now earlier, Robby talked
about all the different ways


916
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:53,966
that people can start a
conversation with Siri,


917
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:56,086
and I'm going to focus
on a couple of those.


918
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,856
Now everyone's familiar
with picking up your device,


919
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,646
pressing the home button, and
starting the conversation.


920
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:06,626
But, another important mode that
we have is what call hands free,


921
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:07,726
where you don't have


922
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,336
to physically touch the
device to start talking.


923
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:14,846
So just by starting your request
with "Hey Siri" you're able


924
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:22,016
to work from across the room,
or -- or well, across the room,


925
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:24,016
if your hands are full, or if
you're doing something else.


926
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,886
Let me show you a
couple examples


927
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:30,566
of how the conversational
interface changes


928
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,416
to adapt to these situations.


929
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:36,536
So, here, we're going to say
I'm holding onto my phone


930
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,296
and pressing the button.


931
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:42,316
So I'll say, "Do I
have any reminders?"


932
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:45,156
>> You have five reminders.


933
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:49,086
>> So as you heard, Siri
presented a quick answer,


934
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:51,636
and then gave visual
information on the screen


935
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,876
since I'm holding it and
I can take a look at that.


936
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:57,976
Now, listen to how this changes
when I activate hands free.


937
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,186
Hey Siri, do I have
any reminders?


938
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:07,296
>> I found five reminders.


939
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:12,766
The first one is talk about
accessibility, then get Siri


940
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,646
to say hi to people
in Cupertino,


941
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:18,026
then go to the next slide.


942
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,936
Do you want me to
read you the rest?


943
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:21,256
>> No thanks Siri.


944
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,786
So as you heard, Siri
read out that information


945
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:26,766
and it gave a smaller amount


946
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:29,346
of information that's
easier for me to understand.


947
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:34,246
And at the end, Siri asks me
for the next step so that I'm


948
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:37,316
in control of the conversation
and what happens next.


949
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:41,366
Now we use these same principles
in other places as well.


950
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,896
In car play, where you need
to keep your eyes on the road.


951
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:50,036
And it's also very helpful for
people with accessibility needs.


952
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:55,166
Now Siri is great because you
can ask for it to perform a task


953
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,376
and its able to do
so, and you don't have


954
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,736
to find an application and
navigate through a visual UI


955
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:03,406
to get something done,
but Siri does more.


956
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,006
Siri understands when you have
devices connected, such as a set


957
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,436
of headphones, or a
Bluetooth hearing aid.


958
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,526
And it adapts what it --
oh, and in another case,


959
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,506
it can recognize settings
such as voice over,


960
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:17,546
which is Apple's
technology for reading


961
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:19,256
out the visual elements
on screen.


962
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:22,756
And it again, adapts
its behavior


963
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:27,626
to help these users
complete their tasks.


964
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,236
So, that's a little bit
about how Siri helps you.


965
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,646
Here's a couple things that
you can do to help Siri.


966
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:36,786
Make sure that you're testing,
as you develop your apps,


967
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:37,976
with many different requests.


968
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:43,846
Testing different
situations, and especially try


969
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:45,136
out things hands free.


970
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:49,066
And throughout the process,


971
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:52,156
make sure that your app is
providing information back


972
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,386
to Siri so that Siri can
represent it back to the person.


973
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:59,786
And that's especially critical
in these hands free situations.


974
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,976
All right, let's move on
to some design guidelines.


975
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:14,886
And I want you to think of this


976
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:17,176
as a conversation
with your users.


977
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,486
And as with any important
conversation,


978
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:23,326
you need to make sure that
you prepare, that you listen,


979
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:28,556
that you ask questions, and
that you respond to the request.


980
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,156
So, how do we prepare?


981
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,456
The first thing is to recognize


982
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,576
that your users aren't
exactly like you.


983
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:40,076
Now, what do I mean by that?


984
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:44,026
You've spent a huge
amount of time developing


985
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:47,406
and designing your application,
and you have an amount


986
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:50,186
of knowledge that's greater
than anyone else will ever have


987
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:52,156
with it, and that's going


988
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:54,006
to influence how you
would talk to Siri.


989
00:45:55,006 --> 00:46:00,216
So, you need to go out and find
some real people, maybe friends,


990
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,846
significant others, or maybe
even people in marketing


991
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:05,996
and ask them what
would you say to Siri?


992
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:13,476
So I'm going to go with
our theme from today,


993
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:17,496
and talk about an
application Unicorn Rides.


994
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,936
So for this fake
application, we went and talked


995
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:25,166
to some real users and they
came back with some responses.


996
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:29,116
Some people might say "Get
a ride", and in this case,


997
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:32,816
Siri is going to ask the user
which application they want


998
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:37,876
to use, and then can continue
through the rest of the task.


999
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,956
Some people may provide
more information,


1000
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,516
and some people may provide
a whole lot more information,


1001
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:45,566
some of which may
not be possible,


1002
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:48,776
because as we all know,
it's really hard to fit more


1003
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:49,976
than two people on a Pegasus.


1004
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:55,536
Once you have all
these responses,


1005
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,386
make sure that your
app is a good listener.


1006
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:02,826
Take all of the information
that the user has provided


1007
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:05,666
and use that, but they
may not provide all


1008
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:06,916
of the information
that you need.


1009
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,496
So, you need to find
ways to get it.


1010
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:11,886
One way, is to pick
a good default,


1011
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:15,486
so if I were requesting
a ride, and I didn't say


1012
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:18,786
where to be picked up, Unicorn
Rides could pick a good default


1013
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,816
that I probably want to
be picked up right here,


1014
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,676
or maybe outside the
building down by the curb.


1015
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,856
You can also make educated
guesses based on your knowledge


1016
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,826
about the user, but
avoid bad surprises.


1017
00:47:34,576 --> 00:47:36,616
You don't want to pick
the most expensive option,


1018
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:41,136
or some other default, or some
other guess that a user is going


1019
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:42,236
to be unhappy with later.


1020
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,786
So if you have questions
and you're not sure


1021
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:48,376
if someone would be unhappy,
maybe the better answer is


1022
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,406
to ask the question to the user.


1023
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:55,096
But, with this, you need to
make sure you keep it simple.


1024
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,376
Nobody wants to play a game of
20 questions when they're trying


1025
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,126
to get something done.


1026
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:03,886
So, only ask for the things
that are absolutely necessary.


1027
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:06,876
And people may provide
information


1028
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:08,566
that your app can't handle,


1029
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:11,656
so you need to send
those errors back to Siri


1030
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:13,716
so that Siri can
present it to the user,


1031
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:18,056
and try to move forward
with the task.


1032
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:22,486
There are two types of questions
that I want to go discuss more,


1033
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,456
and Brandon talked
about them earlier.


1034
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,236
The first is confirmation.


1035
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:30,686
And this is great when you
have one item, that you want


1036
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,556
to check with the user.


1037
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:37,426
And this could happen because
you made an educated guess,


1038
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:41,186
or if there's an item that
would have really big impact.


1039
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:45,266
So if someone is used to
making small purchases,


1040
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,676
or small payments
with your payment app,


1041
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,966
and suddenly they make a payment
that's much, much larger,


1042
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,556
you may want to confirm
that with them


1043
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:53,646
to make sure it's
what they meant.


1044
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:57,616
The next is disambiguation.


1045
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,576
And this is great when
you have multiple options,


1046
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:02,936
and you need the
user to pick one.


1047
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,086
So this can be used when
you have a small list,


1048
00:49:07,256 --> 00:49:10,686
such as the available ride
types at a given time.


1049
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:15,376
Or, if you have a much
larger list, say I was going


1050
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:19,516
to send a message to Eric,
and I have a number of people


1051
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:22,016
in my contacts, I
can filter that down


1052
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:24,236
to just the possible
matches for Eric,


1053
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:25,926
and let the user pick that.


1054
00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:31,866
Siri can present this list both
visually, and through speaking.


1055
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:35,976
And the user can respond by
tapping or saying the response.


1056
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:43,106
So before you perform
the task, Siri will check


1057
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,426
with your extension, to make
sure everything's ready.


1058
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:49,826
And it wants to get all
the information back


1059
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:54,326
from your extension, so that it
can then present it to the user.


1060
00:49:56,546 --> 00:50:00,006
Now, again, Siri will
present this vocally,


1061
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:02,976
and it will provide a UI on
screen to show this information.


1062
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,976
If the user decides to continue,


1063
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,896
if the user decides to continue,


1064
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:14,646
you should go perform
the action, and again,


1065
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:19,336
return those results back to
Siri so that Siri can show those


1066
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:20,826
to the user and tell the user.


1067
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:23,976
And in the same way that
the user made the request,


1068
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:28,506
they started in a conversation
and Siri can reply back


1069
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:29,736
in the conversation as well.


1070
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,956
The great thing about that,
is it works everywhere.


1071
00:50:34,346 --> 00:50:37,666
It works in car play, it
works hands free, and it works


1072
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,036
when somebody's touching
the device.


1073
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:44,726
And Siri will again, provide
a visual UI to help out.


1074
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:48,666
But, if you want,


1075
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:52,906
your application can provide
a custom UI to bring the feel


1076
00:50:52,906 --> 00:50:54,546
of your app into Siri.


1077
00:50:54,816 --> 00:51:00,666
I want you to exercise restraint
and limit what you show.


1078
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,186
The person is trying to get a
task done, and you don't want


1079
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,086
to distract them


1080
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:08,226
with information
that they don't need.


1081
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,856
You also need to make sure
that you're designing this UI


1082
00:51:10,856 --> 00:51:14,396
for different screen sizes,
from the smallest phone


1083
00:51:14,396 --> 00:51:14,976
up to the biggest iPad.


1084
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,136
Here's another example
of the custom UI


1085
00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:22,976
from our Unicorn
Chat application.


1086
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,726
And as Brandon said,
you should use our API


1087
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:33,006
to hide any redundant
information.


1088
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:37,206
As you do so, you
need to make sure


1089
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:39,706
that your custom UI
represents everything visually,


1090
00:51:40,456 --> 00:51:43,326
and that you send all the
information back to Siri


1091
00:51:43,826 --> 00:51:45,936
so that hands free
requests will still work


1092
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:47,216
when they can't see this UI.


1093
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:53,346
In a few cases, Siri will
open your application


1094
00:51:53,516 --> 00:51:55,596
to finish a request,
and we would do


1095
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:57,496
that for a photo search request


1096
00:51:57,676 --> 00:51:59,456
where we can show the
results in your app.


1097
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:01,876
And this is great because
your app can provide the


1098
00:52:01,876 --> 00:52:02,886
follow-up actions.


1099
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:07,266
Now anytime a user goes
from Siri to your app,


1100
00:52:07,896 --> 00:52:09,136
you don't want to surprise them.


1101
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:12,216
Don't put any interstitial
information or alerts


1102
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,066
in the way, and make sure


1103
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:16,976
that you are only performing the
action that they have requested.


1104
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,596
Okay, next, let's
do a couple tips


1105
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:22,976
about polishing your design.


1106
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:33,966
So, earlier Brandon talked about
the app specific vocabulary,


1107
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:35,686
and the examples
that you can give.


1108
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:39,776
And people can find that
information by going to Siri


1109
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:46,136
and just asking,
"What can you do?"


1110
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:49,196
Siri will show lots of
different things that it can do,


1111
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:52,726
including your applications, and
the examples that you provide.


1112
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:55,476
So I want to give you
some tips about how


1113
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:56,706
to write good examples.


1114
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,056
Make sure that your examples
include your app name,


1115
00:53:00,296 --> 00:53:03,586
so that people can get to your
app for your functionality.


1116
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:09,636
Keep your examples short, and
focused on what your app can do.


1117
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:12,766
You should provide multiple
examples for each intent


1118
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:14,526
that you support, and make sure


1119
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:16,396
that you prioritize
both your intents


1120
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,626
and the examples
within those intents.


1121
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:23,816
If your app works in multiple
languages and locales,


1122
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:26,716
make sure that you
provide localized examples


1123
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:28,706
in the appropriate places.


1124
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:33,786
And most importantly,
make sure that they work.


1125
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:36,886
A couple things to avoid.


1126
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:41,476
You don't need to address
Siri in your examples,


1127
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:45,546
and you also don't need any
unnecessary pleasantries.


1128
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:50,396
Just focus on the
functionality of your app.


1129
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,456
And the last thing I
want to talk about,


1130
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,516
is iterating on the experience.


1131
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:58,456
You want to make sure that
you have time to explore


1132
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:01,976
and to experiment in how
you shape the conversation.


1133
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:06,666
Make sure that you
talk to real people,


1134
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:08,766
not just what they
would say at first,


1135
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:12,266
but throughout the process
of getting something done.


1136
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,206
And again, try it in different
situations, hands free,


1137
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:20,686
or out and about, not
just testing at a desk.


1138
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:23,646
And throughout, make sure


1139
00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:25,796
that you are asking,
"Does it feel right?"


1140
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:29,866
If you need to, make a
change, and iterate again,


1141
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:33,876
because we want to
get to a point


1142
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:37,406
where you have a great Siri
experience for your users.


1143
00:54:39,266 --> 00:54:44,216
So, let's recap what
we've talked about today.


1144
00:54:44,376 --> 00:54:49,166
Robby started us out introducing
SiriKit, bringing the power


1145
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:53,776
of Siri and your applications to
a conversation for your users.


1146
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,606
Brandon talked about
creating extensions


1147
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:01,036
and the way they communicate
with Siri through intents


1148
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:04,606
and intent responses,
and the methods


1149
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:08,356
of resolve, confirm, and handle.


1150
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:13,376
And also that your apps
need to provide vocabulary


1151
00:55:13,786 --> 00:55:16,426
of the common things that
people will say to your app.


1152
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:19,276
And then we talked about design.


1153
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,926
Introducing the conversational
interaction,


1154
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:23,886
the conversational interface,


1155
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,246
and talking about the
options you can choose


1156
00:55:27,246 --> 00:55:28,746
as you're developing
your application


1157
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,836
that will shape the
conversation for your users.


1158
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:39,436
And last we talked about
iterating, so that we can get


1159
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:44,096
to a Siri experience that
feels effortless, and magical.


1160
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:47,276
We have more information
about this session on the web.


1161
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,546
We have some related
sessions this week,


1162
00:55:51,996 --> 00:55:55,776
and I want to especially
highlight Extending Your Apps


1163
00:55:55,776 --> 00:55:57,596
with SiriKit, which is tomorrow,


1164
00:55:58,056 --> 00:56:01,526
where some of our colleagues
will go into more details


1165
