00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:10,866
>> Good morning!


4
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:16,276
Welcome to In-App Purchases and


5
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,376
Using Server-to-Server


6
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:18,286
Notifications.


7
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,386
My name is Dana DuBois, and I'm


8
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,296
an App Store engineering


9
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:21,766
manager.


10
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:24,806
We'll talk about a number of


11
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:25,466
things today.


12
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:27,086
First I'm going to start off


13
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,846
about what's new in StoreKit.


14
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,246
What have we changed since we


15
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,036
were here last year?


16
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,436
Then I'm going to hand it off to


17
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,896
my colleague Tori, and she's


18
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:36,956
going to give you everything you


19
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:37,976
need to know about


20
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,716
Server-to-Server Notifications,


21
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:40,906
and how you can make sure you


22
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,376
have the latest information


23
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,866
about your subscription


24
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,786
customers on your backend.


25
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,166
Next up, Manjeet is going to


26
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,626
walk through the different


27
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:52,836
billing events during the


28
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:53,996
subscription lifecycle.


29
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,896
And then, finally, he's going to


30
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:57,726
walk you through what you need


31
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,366
to know to reduce involuntary


32
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:00,906
churn, and keep your


33
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,816
subscription customers in your


34
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:03,466
service.


35
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,616
So, first.


36
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,506
What's new in StoreKit?


37
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,756
Well, this spring we introduced


38
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:12,866
subscription offers.


39
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,266
Subscription offers is a feature


40
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:19,676
that we introduced that gives


41
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:22,296
you a tool to retain existing


42
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:25,156
subscribers as well as win back


43
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:26,966
subscribers who used to be in


44
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:27,696
the service.


45
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,516
You can achieve this by having


46
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:35,226
up to 10 different active offers


47
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,716
per subscription, that will give


48
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:39,866
you a discount or free service


49
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,626
that you can give to your


50
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:41,356
customers.


51
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,186
Your app decides what to present


52
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:46,156
and to whom.


53
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,816
It's completely up to you.


54
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,926
This is such a great feature,


55
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,406
and such a big feature, that we


56
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:52,496
actually have a dedicated


57
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:54,036
session to that later today,


58
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,076
right here at 2 o'clock.


59
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,696
If you have subscriptions in


60
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,706
your service, I highly recommend


61
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,006
you check that out.


62
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:03,946
So, what else is new in


63
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:04,456
StoreKit?


64
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,326
Well, this summer, we're


65
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,936
announcing that we've introduced


66
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:08,936
the SKStorefront.


67
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,906
SKStorefront is how we're


68
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:13,806
actually exposing to you, the


69
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:15,986
developer, the storefront that


70
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,566
the user has set their App Store


71
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:18,496
to.


72
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,646
This allows you to present the


73
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,786
right content to your customers.


74
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,256
What do you want to merchandise


75
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,646
to your customers all around the


76
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:27,966
world?


77
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,796
You can use the SKStorefront to


78
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:33,026
get specific territory for that


79
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,376
customer on their device.


80
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:36,686
This is the same way that the


81
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,176
App Store exposes content.


82
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:41,956
And, this API gives you the


83
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:43,696
storefront that the App Store is


84
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,696
currently set to.


85
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:47,756
One thing to keep in mind is


86
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,136
that this API returns a


87
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,466
device-specific cached value for


88
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,296
that storefront.


89
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,536
And, it can change over time, so


90
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:56,496
there's some stuff you need to


91
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:57,886
think about while you're


92
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,726
interfacing with the


93
00:02:58,726 --> 00:02:59,516
SKStorefront.


94
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,456
So, let's get into the code, and


95
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:01,976
see how this will all work.


96
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:07,936
So, if you're interfacing with


97
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,416
StoreKit today, you're already


98
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:10,806
have a delegate on the


99
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:11,986
SKPaymentQueue.


100
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,376
We've added on that, the ability


101
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:17,276
to get a parameter that returns


102
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,116
the current cached value for the


103
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:19,706
storefront.


104
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:21,556
Just .storefront, and that'll


105
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,356
give you the value.


106
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,746
Because it can change, and


107
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,036
because it's device-specific, it


108
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,976
is possible, though unlikely,


109
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:28,966
that it will be nil.


110
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,286
So, you need to check for that


111
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,636
in your app, and make sure you


112
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:34,316
do the right thing.


113
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:35,906
Once you have that storefront,


114
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,366
right on that API, is a country


115
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:38,746
code.


116
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,256
And, that's a 3-letter,


117
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,386
ISO-standard value for


118
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,966
territories and countries all


119
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,606
around the world.


120
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:46,226
And, that'll tell you exactly


121
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,666
what the App Store is set to on


122
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,366
that device.


123
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:49,706
And, that's really it.


124
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,896
That'll allow you then to take


125
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,406
that country code, and


126
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,556
merchandise the right content to


127
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:56,486
your customers.


128
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:58,496
But, as I said, it can change


129
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,286
over time.


130
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,176
So, let's go a little deeper


131
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,026
into the code, and see what else


132
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:02,806
you need to think about.


133
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:06,916
Here we have an example of some


134
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,346
code where you're taking your


135
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,376
product identifiers that you


136
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,506
fetch from your backend, passing


137
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:14,316
it in and then trying to


138
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,656
determine if you should fetch


139
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,995
the metadata, do an SKProduct


140
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,495
request to determine if you


141
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,125
should show that content or not.


142
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,466
So, what the developer has done


143
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,856
there is, fetch that metadata


144
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:30,016
from their backend, and did a


145
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:32,326
call to say, hey, is this


146
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:34,506
storefront valid for that code?


147
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:36,046
And then, you can see here,


148
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,286
right before you fetch product


149
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:39,656
info, you would call shouldShow.


150
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,556
If that returns true, add that


151
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:44,686
identifier to the list of things


152
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:45,296
you're going to make an


153
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,586
SKProduct request on.


154
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,476
You should do that before you


155
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:49,876
make the SKProduct request,


156
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:50,986
because if you're not going to


157
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,736
merchandise that product, it's


158
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,176
more efficient not to actually


159
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,286
fetch the product-- the product


160
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:56,836
metadata.


161
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:01,216
But, as I said before, it can


162
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,356
change over time.


163
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,676
The users could actually switch


164
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,856
accounts, or even-- it's even


165
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:08,186
possible within the same account


166
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,436
to go into the App Store and


167
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,946
browse different storefronts.


168
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:12,456
Developers will do this a lot


169
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,736
when they actually want to see


170
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,306
their app in different


171
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:16,546
territories around the world,


172
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,396
see what it looks like.


173
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,176
See how it's doing.


174
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,316
There's ways of doing that in


175
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:19,746
the App Store.


176
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,066
So, we want to make sure you


177
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,746
have the latest information in


178
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:23,476
your running app.


179
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,066
So, on the SKPayment transaction


180
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,756
observer, we added a new


181
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,296
paymentQueueDidChange event that


182
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,166
you can listen for, right inside


183
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:32,766
your app.


184
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,386
That passes in the payment


185
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:34,726
queue.


186
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,196
When you get that, you go


187
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,666
queue.storefront, and get the


188
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,786
new value for what that


189
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:39,576
storefront is.


190
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,806
And, again, it's a new


191
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:42,336
storefront.


192
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,606
So, you want to reload all the


193
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,236
content specific to that new


194
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:46,736
store front.


195
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,466
You might actually have


196
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,666
different content that you want


197
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,926
to merchandise based on where


198
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:50,976
that user is in the world.


199
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,776
So, again, call shouldShow.


200
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,796
Determine if you should, and


201
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,316
fetch product information for


202
00:05:59,316 --> 00:05:59,383
it.


203
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:02,466
So, what happens when you're


204
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,436
doing a purchase?


205
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,306
You've merchandised some


206
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,346
content, the user's about to go


207
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,916
buy it, and normally everything


208
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,576
will go fine.


209
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,286
But, if the user is actually in


210
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,646
a different storefront from what


211
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:14,076
their device was set to, it is


212
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:16,366
possible that the payment queue


213
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,336
will change storefronts in the


214
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,476
middle of that transaction.


215
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,146
So, we've given you a


216
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,546
paymentQueue delegate that


217
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,396
allows you to listen to


218
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:27,006
paymentQueue: shouldContinue: in


219
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:27,826
newStorefront.


220
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,236
This is your chance to


221
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,406
double-check, should I allow


222
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,636
this purchase to happen in this


223
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:33,346
new storefront?


224
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,256
And, again use that same


225
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,156
shouldShow functionality, where


226
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:38,506
you've listed all your product


227
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,426
identifiers, and you know all


228
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,436
the territories that those


229
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:42,686
products are available in.


230
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,506
Just-- if it returns true, allow


231
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,436
the payment to continue.


232
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,936
To make sure that it's the best


233
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:51,756
user experience, we want this to


234
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,606
return fast, so you shouldn't


235
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,356
make a server-side call in the


236
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:56,596
middle of paymentQueue:


237
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,066
shouldContinue: newStorefront.


238
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,876
You should have this information


239
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,556
cached on your device, what's


240
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:03,276
available in the territories,


241
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,836
ready to go when the payment's


242
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:05,316
happening.


243
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,196
That way, you can return real


244
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:08,876
quick, the user can continue


245
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,646
their purchase, or, if you're


246
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,616
returning no, you can actually


247
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,866
inform the user why it's not


248
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,076
valid in the new storefront.


249
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,336
So, as I said, maybe it's not


250
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:20,616
available in the new territory.


251
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:23,036
So, what do you do then?


252
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,476
Well, when that happens, in your


253
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,156
paymentQueue:


254
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,726
updatedTransactions delegate


255
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:29,556
call, we'll return an


256
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:31,696
SKStoreProductNotAvailable


257
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:31,996
error.


258
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,416
This will inform you that you've


259
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,846
just told us that you shouldn't


260
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,306
allow this transaction to happen


261
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,156
in that new storefront.


262
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,816
And, here's your chance to


263
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:41,116
present a dialog.


264
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,906
Or, merchandise some other piece


265
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:44,836
of content that might be


266
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:45,626
equivalent in the new


267
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:46,196
storefront.


268
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,446
Show an alert, update the UI, do


269
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:50,336
what you need to do right then


270
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,476
and there.


271
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,306
So, that's SKStorefront.


272
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,496
What else are we introducing?


273
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:03,676
Well, in iOS 11, 11.2 and tvOS


274
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:07,026
11.2, and macOS 10.13.2, we


275
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,566
introduced app pre-orders.


276
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,286
This has been a great feature


277
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:13,156
that developers have used all,


278
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,756
you know, around the world, to


279
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,116
actually get interest in their


280
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,386
apps before they're available in


281
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:17,866
the store.


282
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:19,676
And, we're excited to announce


283
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:20,716
that we're introducing that with


284
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,896
watchOS 6.0 this year, so you


285
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,636
can market your apps right to


286
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,336
the Watch, and gain interest


287
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:28,566
ahead of time, like having them


288
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:29,816
be available for pre-order.


289
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,025
But, we're also doing one more


290
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:32,836
thing this year.


291
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,826
And, coming soon, we're actually


292
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,476
going to signal inside the app


293
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,676
receipt, if the app was


294
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,996
purchased as a pre-order.


295
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,996
So, you'll know which of your


296
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,866
customers have actually


297
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,966
pre-ordered the app.


298
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,866
And, you can use that to, you


299
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,586
know, give them great messages,


300
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:50,386
saying thank you for


301
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:51,446
pre-ordering my app.


302
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,636
Or, if you want to unlock some


303
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,426
additional content as a thank


304
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:55,276
you to some of your best


305
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,776
customers, you can use that


306
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:57,286
information.


307
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,186
That'll be available in the


308
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:58,606
receipt.


309
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,946
And, the great thing about the


310
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,146
receipt is that this will go


311
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:04,796
back to iOS 11, 12, all the way


312
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:05,176
back in time.


313
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:05,976
It's available in the receipt.


314
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,066
[ Applause ]


315
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:10,966
So, those are some of the things


316
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,376
that have changed with StoreKit,


317
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,496
and in-app purchases since we


318
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:14,236
were here last year.


319
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,646
Next up, I'm excited to hand it


320
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:18,036
off to my colleague Tori, and


321
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,056
she's going to talk all about


322
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,616
Server-to-Server Notifications.


323
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:20,946
Tori?


324
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:27,500
[ Applause ]


325
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,506
>> Hi everyone.


326
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:33,166
My name's Tori, and I'm very


327
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,866
excited to be here today to talk


328
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,036
to you about Server-to-Server


329
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:36,886
Notifications.


330
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,396
We have several new features


331
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,426
that we want to bring to the


332
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:41,706
server-to-server notification,


333
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,336
and I want to do an in-depth


334
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,286
talk with you on how you can use


335
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,796
these to effectively monitor


336
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:47,906
your subscription events.


337
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,286
But, before we get into all


338
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:52,316
that, let's first take a look at


339
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:53,356
what Server-to-Server


340
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:55,096
Notifications are, and how you


341
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,626
can set up your servers to


342
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:56,936
receive them.


343
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:02,516
So, Server-to-Server


344
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,276
Notifications are an HTTP POST


345
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:07,126
we send from our server to


346
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:08,816
yours, with a JSON body.


347
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,746
You might recognize these by


348
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:11,676
their previous name,


349
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,596
statusUpdateNotifications.


350
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:15,976
Server-to-server notifications


351
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,856
are incredibly useful for


352
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,476
getting of-the-moment updates on


353
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,156
your subscription events, and


354
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,656
for using them so win back


355
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,316
customers in cases like


356
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,226
subscription offers.


357
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,526
Once you've determined which


358
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,976
endpoint you want to receive


359
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:29,676
your Server-to-Server


360
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,686
Notifications at, all you have


361
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,016
to do is return a 200 response


362
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,426
from that endpoint to indicate a


363
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,146
successfully received message.


364
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,206
However, should you not return a


365
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,736
200 response, we will retry up


366
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,716
to three times to resend the


367
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:46,616
notification to you.


368
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:49,916
Once you have determined this


369
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,766
endpoint, you first have to set


370
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:52,956
it up in App Store Connect.


371
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:54,826
You can find this place on your


372
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,156
app's App Information page, in


373
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,286
the Subscription Status URL


374
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:58,656
section.


375
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,496
In addition to setting up your


376
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,646
endpoint in App Store Connect,


377
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:07,336
there are certain security


378
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,426
requirements which the


379
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,406
connection must adhere to in


380
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,726
order for you to successfully


381
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,176
receive these notifications.


382
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:15,726
Basically, this all sums up to,


383
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,086
the connection must be App


384
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:19,576
Transport Security, or ATS,


385
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:20,726
compliant.


386
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:22,686
Now, this means a few things.


387
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,516
First, the certificate must be


388
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,156
issued by a trusted certificate


389
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:27,636
authority.


390
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:30,606
The Transport Layer Security


391
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,386
version, or TLS version, must be


392
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,426
TLS 1.2.


393
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:37,056
You must use one of the provided


394
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,166
symmetric ciphers, and the


395
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,116
certificate must be signed and


396
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,886
hashed using an algorithm which


397
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:45,096
is SHA-256 or greater.


398
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:47,496
I hope with all this


399
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:48,666
information, you have a better


400
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,636
understanding of what


401
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,126
Server-to-Server Notifications


402
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,816
are, and how you can set them


403
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:53,106
up.


404
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:54,576
Should you need more


405
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,026
information, you can look up the


406
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:56,996
documentation for


407
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,136
statusUpdateNotifications on


408
00:11:59,136 --> 00:11:59,966
developer.apple.com.


409
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,486
So, now that we've looked into


410
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:07,376
what Server-to-Server


411
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,796
Notifications are, and how you


412
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,376
can receive them, I'm very


413
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:11,636
excited to talk to you about the


414
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:12,836
new features and new


415
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,366
notification types we are


416
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,616
bringing to Server-to-Server


417
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:16,426
Notifications.


418
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,156
So, as we were thinking about


419
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,356
some new features we could add


420
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,936
to the notification, we were


421
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,316
taking a look at the receipt


422
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,496
fields currently in the


423
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,596
notification, latest receipt,


424
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:27,916
and latest receipt info.


425
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,546
We noticed that these receipts,


426
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,186
while useful, only give you


427
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,056
information about the latest


428
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:34,806
in-app purchase.


429
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,736
So, we were thinking how much


430
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,446
more useful it would be if we


431
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:39,516
could give you your entire


432
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,186
subscription history when we


433
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:42,726
send you the server-to-server


434
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,466
notification.


435
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:46,136
For this reason, we are bringing


436
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,686
the unified receipt to the


437
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,976
server-to-server notification.


438
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:52,500
[ Applause ]


439
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,356
So, as a review, the unified


440
00:12:58,356 --> 00:12:59,866
receipt contains the history of


441
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,426
subscription purchases for your


442
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:02,066
subscription.


443
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,146
Previously, this incredibly


444
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,246
valuable information could only


445
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:07,266
be obtained through hitting


446
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,166
verifyReceipt.


447
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,796
The two receipt fields in the


448
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,306
notification right now, latest


449
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,956
receipt, and latest receipt info


450
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,026
provide an encoded and decoded


451
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,406
transactional receipt about the


452
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:18,456
latest in-app purchase.


453
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,466
Starting in the fall, you'll


454
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,266
begin to see one new field in


455
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:22,986
the server-to-server


456
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:23,756
notification.


457
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,826
We have decided to call this


458
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,846
unified receipt, and it will


459
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,646
contain almost exactly what you


460
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,016
expect to get from verified


461
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:31,376
receipt.


462
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:35,316
With the addition of unified


463
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,506
receipt to the server-to-server


464
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,476
notification, in most cases,


465
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:39,866
this will make latest receipt


466
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,586
and latest receipt info no


467
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:42,846
longer needed.


468
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:46,126
However, there is one important


469
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,656
caveat we must call out here.


470
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,196
This receipt that we are


471
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,346
generating for you is not tied


472
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,256
to a specific install of an app


473
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,586
on a device, like the receipts


474
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,196
you are used to receiving as the


475
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:57,926
result of a buy.


476
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:00,496
For this reason, the receipt


477
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,006
should always be stored on your


478
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:04,716
server, and never locally on a


479
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,086
device.


480
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,356
So, with that out of the way,


481
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:10,586
let's take a look at what you


482
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:11,726
can expect to find in the


483
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,056
unified receipt in the


484
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,496
server-to-server notification.


485
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,736
The first field you will find in


486
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,206
this JSON object is the latest


487
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:18,596
receipt.


488
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:20,566
This is an encoded unified


489
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,656
receipt, which we have just


490
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,226
generated for you, and you can


491
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,496
use this to hit verified receipt


492
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,786
later, if you should need it.


493
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,226
You will also find the latest


494
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:29,936
receipt info.


495
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,036
This contains an array of


496
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:33,616
subscription purchases for your


497
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:35,466
subscription, with metadata


498
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:36,826
about them to help you track


499
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:37,976
what has been going on with your


500
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:38,506
subscriber.


501
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:40,976
You will also find the pending


502
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:41,666
renewal info.


503
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,766
This contains information about


504
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,106
the upcoming renewal for your


505
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,976
subscription, such as if the


506
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,336
customer is in a price increase


507
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,776
flow, or they have entered a


508
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:50,846
billing retry period.


509
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,296
We will also include the status


510
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:54,556
of the receipt, and the


511
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,626
environment the receipt was


512
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,756
produced in, either sandbox, or


513
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:58,266
production.


514
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,906
We chose to name the fields this


515
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,236
way because this mirrors what


516
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,476
you expect to receive from


517
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:04,276
verify receipt.


518
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,526
So, hopefully you can reuse your


519
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,106
parsing logic there to make the


520
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,116
transition easier here.


521
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,196
However, latest receipt info


522
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,956
will be limited to the 100


523
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,296
latest in-app purchases.


524
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:18,936
So, should you need more


525
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,366
information that this, you can


526
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,286
always hit verify receipt with


527
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,006
the provided encoded receipt.


528
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:26,256
So, let's look at the


529
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,626
notification types we currently


530
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:27,886
have.


531
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:29,466
There are currently four


532
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,686
existing notification types.


533
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,516
INITIAL BUY, INTERACTIVE


534
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,046
RENEWAL, DID CHANGE RENEWAL


535
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,596
PREFERENCES, and CANCEL.


536
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,346
And, we are adding four more.


537
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,326
DID CHANGE RENEWAL STATUS, DID


538
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:43,196
FAIL TO RENEW, DID RECOVER, and


539
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:43,976
PRICE INCREASE CONSENT.


540
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:49,500
[ Applause ]


541
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,546
Now, let's take a quick look at


542
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:54,406
each of those four new


543
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:55,656
notification types, so we can


544
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,186
get an idea of why they are


545
00:15:57,286 --> 00:15:57,526
sent.


546
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,796
First, let's look at DID CHANGE


547
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:01,506
RENEWAL STATUS.


548
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:03,056
This is sent when the user


549
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,106
toggles auto-renew on or off.


550
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:06,986
You should actually be receiving


551
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:08,606
this notification right now, so


552
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:09,436
make sure that you're looking


553
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,506
for it if you are currently


554
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,516
using our Server-to-Server


555
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,256
Notifications.


556
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,626
We will soon be adding a


557
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,906
notification type called DID


558
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:16,396
FAIL TO RENEW.


559
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,696
We will send this to you when a


560
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,436
subscription fails auto-renew at


561
00:16:20,436 --> 00:16:21,876
the first attempt to renew in a


562
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:22,766
subscription period.


563
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,866
You will start to see this


564
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,206
notification in the fall.


565
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,656
Hand-in-hand with DID FAIL TO


566
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,006
RENEW comes DID RECOVER.


567
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,206
DID RECOVER will be sent when we


568
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,616
recover billing of your


569
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,386
subscription during the billing


570
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:37,326
retry period.


571
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,546
This will also start to appear


572
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:40,036
in the fall.


573
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,156
Should you receive DID RECOVER,


574
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:43,366
you should have recently


575
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:44,906
received DID FAIL TO RENEW.


576
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:46,416
And, you can know that billing


577
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,746
of your subscription was


578
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,726
successfully recovered.


579
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:50,906
If you are currently using our


580
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,366
Server-to-Server Notifications,


581
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,016
you may notice that we will be


582
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,536
sending DID RECOVER when we


583
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,116
currently send our renewal


584
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,066
notification type.


585
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:01,516
The plan is for DID RECOVER to


586
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,326
eventually replace RENEWAL as it


587
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,326
is a bit more aptly named, but


588
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:06,576
for a period, when we start


589
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:07,826
sending DID RECOVER, we will


590
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:09,856
send you both DID RECOVER and


591
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,536
RENEWAL to give you time to


592
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,726
adjust to the change.


593
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:16,116
Finally, we're adding a fourth


594
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:17,646
notification type, PRICE


595
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:18,435
INCREASE CONSENT.


596
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,796
PRICE INCREASE CONSENT will be


597
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,556
sent to you when we detect that


598
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,116
one of your subscribers has


599
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:25,566
entered a price increase flow,


600
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,476
which requires their consent in


601
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:28,656
order for them to continue


602
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:29,786
renewing their subscription.


603
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,296
With this notification, comes a


604
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,946
new field in the JSON payload,


605
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,656
price increase effective date.


606
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,966
This is the date by which the


607
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,606
customer must agree to the price


608
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:40,946
increase in order for them to


609
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:41,786
continue renewing.


610
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:43,856
You may also expect to see this


611
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,976
notification in the fall.


612
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:50,886
So now that we've taken a look


613
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,336
into what's new in


614
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,786
Server-to-Server Notifications,


615
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,506
I'm really excited to talk to


616
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,946
you about how you can handle all


617
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:58,336
eight of our notification types


618
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,216
so you are getting the most out


619
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,816
of each notification when you


620
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:02,286
receive it.


621
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:05,796
So, first, let's take a quick


622
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,046
overview of our existing


623
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:07,926
notification types.


624
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,486
INITIAL BUY, INTERACTIVE


625
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:14,216
RENEWAL, DID CHANGE RENEWAL


626
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:15,846
PREFERENCES, and CANCEL.


627
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,136
We're going to take a moment to


628
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:19,776
take a deep-dive into each of


629
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,446
these notification types, but


630
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,466
before we do that, I want you to


631
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,646
notice one trend up here on this


632
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:26,896
chart.


633
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,096
You'll notice that in the JSON


634
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:31,456
payload, we're asking you to


635
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:32,356
look for the original


636
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:33,926
transaction id for each


637
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:34,826
notification type.


638
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,046
This is because the original


639
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,746
transaction id is considered a


640
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,316
unique identifier for your


641
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:40,946
subscription.


642
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,916
And, keeping track of this will


643
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,566
help you to link subsequent


644
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,986
events back to the initial


645
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,366
purchase of your subscription.


646
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,856
Now, let's imagine for a moment


647
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:51,906
that you have a potential


648
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:52,516
subscriber.


649
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,666
Let's call him John, and he is


650
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,226
interested in purchasing your


651
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:56,846
subscription.


652
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:58,906
Let's take a walk through


653
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,226
decisions that John makes


654
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,236
concerning his subscription, and


655
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,396
what notifications you will


656
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:03,966
receive along the way.


657
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,296
So, the first notification type


658
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:12,776
you can expect to receive for a


659
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,326
subscription is the INITIAL BUY.


660
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:16,836
When John first purchases his


661
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,116
subscription, we will send you


662
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,446
an INITIAL BUY notification.


663
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:21,106
Upon receiving this


664
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,796
notification, you can update the


665
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,246
customer status to something


666
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,136
like "active" or "subscribed" on


667
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:29,026
your server, and provide service


668
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:29,826
for the newly purchased


669
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:30,386
subscription.


670
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,336
In this notification type, there


671
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,646
are four fields that I want you


672
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,266
to look for in the JSON payload.


673
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,366
The first of these is the


674
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,116
purchase date.


675
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:40,746
This is in milliseconds


676
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,956
since epoch, and it will


677
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,676
tell you the exact date and time


678
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,206
that your customer has purchased


679
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:45,906
your subscription.


680
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,046
You should next look for the


681
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:49,366
original transaction id.


682
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:51,626
As I mentioned, this is a unique


683
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,836
identifier for your


684
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,556
subscription, and keeping track


685
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,086
of this now will let you link


686
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,926
subsequent notifications back to


687
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,166
this initial buy.


688
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,536
You should also check for the


689
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,976
web order line item id.


690
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,256
This is considered a unique


691
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,926
identifier for each subscription


692
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,596
period and should you need to


693
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,036
hit verify receipt after


694
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:11,616
receiving this notification, it


695
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,536
will link this notification to


696
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:15,246
an entry in the verifyReceipt


697
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:15,436
array.


698
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:18,536
Finally, you should look for the


699
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:19,306
product id.


700
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,516
The product id will tell you


701
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,466
exactly which product your new


702
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,636
customer has subscribed to.


703
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,246
So, after John has been using


704
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,056
his subscription for a while, he


705
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,566
decides that he wants to upgrade


706
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,066
his service to a higher tier.


707
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,436
We consider this a renewal in


708
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,136
the foreground, so we will send


709
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,436
you an INTERACTIVE RENEWAL


710
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,166
notification type.


711
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:43,656
Because an upgrade gives the


712
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:45,656
customer access to the higher


713
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,396
tier immediately, we will also


714
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,146
send you a CANCEL notification


715
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,206
type for the lower tier


716
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,606
subscription, which we have


717
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:52,096
canceled.


718
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,936
However, should a customer


719
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:56,706
resubscribe after churn, you


720
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,646
will receive only an INTERACTIVE


721
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,056
RENEWAL notification type.


722
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:03,406
In this notification, there are


723
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:04,926
four more fields you should look


724
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,346
for in the JSON payload.


725
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:10,416
The first of these will be the


726
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,106
purchase date.


727
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,906
This will tell you the exact


728
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:14,756
date and time that your customer


729
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,346
either resubscribed to this


730
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,806
subscription or upgraded their


731
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:18,236
service.


732
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,826
You should again be checking for


733
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,016
the original transaction id to


734
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:24,266
link this back to the original


735
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,596
subscription, as well as the web


736
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:28,796
order line item id.


737
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:30,976
This is the unique identifier


738
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:32,146
for each subscription period,


739
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:33,436
and it will help you to link


740
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,576
this notification to an entry in


741
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:36,666
the verifyReceipt array.


742
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,066
Finally, check for the product


743
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:40,266
id.


744
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,146
This will tell you the exact


745
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,826
product that your customer has


746
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:45,466
re-subscribed to or upgraded


747
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,096
their service to.


748
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,766
A little later down the line,


749
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:51,216
John decides to downgrade his


750
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,926
subscription to a more basic


751
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:53,216
tier.


752
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,736
In this case, we send you a DID


753
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,276
CHANGE RENEWAL PREFERENCES


754
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,216
notification type.


755
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,056
Upon receiving this


756
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,756
notification, you can update the


757
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,256
customer's subscription status


758
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,186
on your server to a more basic


759
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:05,366
tier.


760
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,016
In this notification type, there


761
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,766
are two fields that I want you


762
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,846
to look out for.


763
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,416
The first of these is the auto


764
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,506
renew product id.


765
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,766
Because a subscription downgrade


766
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,166
does not take place until the


767
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,846
end of the subscription period,


768
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:22,096
this will tell you exactly which


769
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,446
product your customer will


770
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,976
auto-renew at when it comes time


771
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,556
for renewal.


772
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,906
You should again be checking for


773
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,946
the original transaction id to


774
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:32,156
link this notification back to


775
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:32,976
the original subscription.


776
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,616
Now, unfortunately, a little


777
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,216
later, John gets on the phone


778
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,526
with customer support and


779
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:43,826
decides to cancel his


780
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:44,416
subscription.


781
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:46,896
In this case, we will send you a


782
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,586
CANCEL notification type.


783
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,036
As I mentioned earlier, when a


784
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,216
customer upgrades their


785
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,686
subscription, you will also


786
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:55,236
receive a CANCEL plus an


787
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:56,816
INTERACTIVE RENEWAL, where the


788
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,756
CANCEL signifies the lower tier


789
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,376
subscription which was canceled.


790
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:03,046
In this notification type, I


791
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,026
want you to look for three


792
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:04,346
fields.


793
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,236
First, you should look for the


794
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,126
cancellation date.


795
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:09,506
This will tell you the exact


796
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,176
date and time that your customer


797
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:12,426
decided to cancel their


798
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,006
subscription.


799
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:15,436
You should still be looking for


800
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,066
the original transaction id to


801
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:18,216
link this back to the original


802
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:21,126
subscription purchase, as well


803
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:22,356
as the product id, to know


804
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:24,046
exactly which product your


805
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:24,976
customer has canceled.


806
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:31,916
So, now that we've looked at all


807
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,166
of our existing notification


808
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,466
types, let's give the same


809
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,566
treatment to the four new


810
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,036
notification types that I


811
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:38,956
introduced earlier.


812
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:43,266
These are DID CHANGE RENEWAL


813
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,726
STATUS, DID FAIL TO RENEW, DID


814
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,666
RECOVER, and PRICE INCREASE


815
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,096
CONSENT.


816
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:50,906
In these notification types, you


817
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,316
still want to be looking for the


818
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,556
original transaction id in each


819
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,696
of the JSON payloads.


820
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,296
As I mentioned earlier, this is


821
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,586
because it is a unique


822
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,146
identifier for your subscription


823
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,106
and will help you to link all of


824
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:04,486
your notifications together.


825
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,396
Now, let's revisit John.


826
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,166
One day he is scrolling through


827
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,686
his managed subscriptions page,


828
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,506
and decides to turn auto-renew


829
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:15,126
back on for your subscription.


830
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:17,596
In this case, we will send you a


831
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,136
DID CHANGE RENEWAL STATUS


832
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:20,296
notification type.


833
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:22,366
You will also receive this


834
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,146
notification if a customer


835
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,986
decides to turn auto-renew off.


836
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,116
Upon receiving this


837
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:30,456
notification, you can update the


838
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:32,196
customer subscription status on


839
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:34,476
your end to reflect the changes.


840
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,186
You can optionally deploy


841
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,086
retention strategies to keep the


842
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:40,396
customer, if you see that they


843
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,556
have turned auto-renew off.


844
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:44,586
In this notification type, there


845
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,096
are four more fields that you


846
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:47,376
should look for and mark down.


847
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,736
The first of these is the auto


848
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,066
renew status change date.


849
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:52,896
This tells you the exact date


850
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,376
and time that your customer's


851
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,606
auto-renew status changed.


852
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,316
You should check for auto-renew


853
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:58,816
status.


854
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:00,896
This will tell you the direction


855
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,106
of the auto-renew toggle.


856
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,076
Should you see the auto renew


857
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:06,476
status has a value of true, you


858
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:07,866
can know that your customer has


859
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:10,436
turned auto-renew back on, and


860
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:12,446
intends to continue buying your


861
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:12,976
subscription.


862
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:15,986
You should again be checking for


863
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:17,846
the original transaction id, to


864
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:19,136
link this back to the original


865
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,736
subscription purchase, as well


866
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,166
as the product id, to see


867
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,396
exactly which product your


868
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,076
customer has turned auto-renew


869
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:26,976
on or off for.


870
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,376
As we are trying to bill John


871
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:34,546
for his subscription during the


872
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,126
auto-renew period, we


873
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:37,566
unfortunately encounter a


874
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:38,196
billing error.


875
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,176
In this case, we will send you a


876
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:41,856
DID FAIL TO RENEW on our first


877
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,506
attempt to renew for that


878
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:44,406
subscription period.


879
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,276
Upon receiving this


880
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:48,256
notification, you can optionally


881
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,066
choose to suspend service for


882
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:50,716
your customer.


883
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:53,446
You can also update the customer


884
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:54,796
subscription status to something


885
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:56,236
like "active" or "billing


886
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:58,126
re-try," depending on the value


887
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,296
of the fields you see in the


888
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,926
JSON payload.


889
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,666
So now, let's take a look at


890
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:01,966
that.


891
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,656
The first field you should be


892
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,366
looking for here is is in


893
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,746
billing retry period.


894
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:09,556
This has a value of 0 or 1, and


895
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:11,196
will tell you if we are actively


896
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,546
trying to recover billing of


897
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:13,666
this subscription for you.


898
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:15,676
Should you see that this field


899
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:17,696
has a value of 1, you can know


900
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:19,156
that we are trying to recover


901
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:20,676
billing of your subscription in


902
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:21,926
the billing re-try period.


903
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:24,866
You should still be checking for


904
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,936
the original transaction id to


905
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,096
link this back to the original


906
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,606
subscription, as well as the


907
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:31,446
expires date.


908
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,266
This will tell you the exact


909
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:35,476
date and time that we attempted


910
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:37,496
to auto-renew your subscription,


911
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:39,956
and it failed.


912
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:41,736
Fortunately, during the billing


913
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:44,166
re-try period, the billing issue


914
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,686
with John's subscription was


915
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:46,956
resolved, and we are able to


916
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:47,976
recover billing of his


917
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:48,566
subscription.


918
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,956
In this case, we send you a DID


919
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,606
RECOVER notification type.


920
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,906
As a reminder, DID RECOVER is


921
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,356
replacing our RENEWAL


922
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,746
notification type, which we


923
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:00,276
currently send at this time.


924
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:03,266
Upon receiving this notification


925
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,006
type, you can restore service


926
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,396
for the recovered subscription,


927
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:08,496
and update your customer's


928
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,896
status to something like


929
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,246
"active" or "subscribed," or


930
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,986
whatever you use to denote an


931
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:13,906
active subscriber.


932
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,706
In this notification type, there


933
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:17,906
are a few more fields that I


934
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:18,846
want you to look for in the


935
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:19,256
payload.


936
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:21,646
You should first check for the


937
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:22,416
purchase date.


938
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,276
This will tell you exactly when


939
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:25,926
we were able to recover billing


940
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:26,826
of this subscription.


941
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:29,626
You should again check for the


942
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,106
original transaction id, as this


943
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,876
will tell you exactly which


944
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,146
subscription we recovered


945
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:36,976
billing for, as it is the unique


946
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,616
identifier for the subscription.


947
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,826
Finally, look for the expires


948
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:42,196
date.


949
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,086
This will tell you the date and


950
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:45,906
time that this new subscription


951
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,106
period will expire.


952
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,326
And, you can expect us to


953
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:48,976
attempt to auto-renew again.


954
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:56,126
Now, let's suppose that you, the


955
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,946
developer, decide to increase


956
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,296
the price of your subscription.


957
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:01,076
When we check for a price


958
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:03,006
increase for a subscription, 7


959
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,066
days before a weekly


960
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,856
subscription renewal, 10 days


961
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:07,076
before a monthly subscription


962
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,126
renewal, and 30 days before an


963
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,936
annual subscription renewal, and


964
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:12,166
we see that you wish to raise


965
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,006
the price, we will send you a


966
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,306
PRICE INCREASE CONSENT


967
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,606
notification for your customer.


968
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:19,766
Upon receiving this


969
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,446
notification, you can update the


970
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,146
user status on your end to


971
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:24,466
something like "price increase."


972
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:27,056
And, optionally, you can deploy


973
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,656
in-app messaging to prompt your


974
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,166
customer to consent to the price


975
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:30,556
increase.


976
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,116
Note that we will also email and


977
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:35,526
send push notifications to the


978
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:36,926
customer to prompt them to


979
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,176
consent to this price increase.


980
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:41,596
In this notification type, there


981
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,576
are a few more fields that I


982
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,266
want you to look for.


983
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:45,296
First, you should look for the


984
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:46,516
price consent status.


985
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:47,936
This will tell you if your


986
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,046
customer has already consented


987
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:51,186
to your price increase.


988
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,636
However, because we are sending


989
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:55,816
this notification to you, almost


990
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,546
as soon as we detect the price


991
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:59,246
increase, you should expect in


992
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,816
most cases that this value will


993
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,766
be 0, or that the customer has


994
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:03,586
not yet consented.


995
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:06,606
You should again be checking for


996
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:08,866
the original transaction id to


997
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:10,716
link this notification back to


998
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,776
the original subscription.


999
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:14,336
Finally, I want you to look for


1000
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,226
the expires date.


1001
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,286
This will tell you the date and


1002
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,666
time that this subscription


1003
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,866
period will expire.


1004
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:22,346
And, by that time, your customer


1005
00:29:22,516 --> 00:29:24,316
will have had to consented to


1006
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:24,976
the price increase.


1007
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:31,136
So, now that we've taken a look


1008
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,036
at what's new to


1009
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,446
Server-to-Server Notifications,


1010
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:34,956
and what you can do to handle


1011
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,526
these notifications, when you


1012
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,286
receive them, I'm going to


1013
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:40,396
invite Manjeet Chawla onstage to


1014
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:41,856
talk to you about subscription


1015
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:42,976
lifecycle, and reducing churn.


1016
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:49,500
[ Applause ]


1017
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:55,406
>> Good morning.


1018
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:57,836
My name is Manjeet Chawla, and


1019
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,246
I'm on the App Store commerce


1020
00:29:59,356 --> 00:29:59,516
scene.


1021
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,146
I'm really excited to be here


1022
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:03,756
today, and talk to you guys


1023
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,586
about how you can use the new


1024
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:08,476
and improved Server-to-Server


1025
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:11,046
Notifications to identify


1026
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:13,416
billing events through a


1027
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:16,236
subscription lifecycle that may


1028
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,666
impact your customer's


1029
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,596
subscription status.


1030
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,866
So, what does the lifecycle of a


1031
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:25,146
subscription look like?


1032
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,616
Now, you may start acquiring new


1033
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,306
customers by offering them a


1034
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:31,396
free trial, or an introductory


1035
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,536
price to attract them to your


1036
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:35,526
service, and let the users try


1037
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:36,656
your service before paying the


1038
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:36,976
full price.


1039
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,806
Next, you keep them engaged to


1040
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,516
your service by providing them


1041
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:45,996
constant updates to your


1042
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:46,466
content.


1043
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:51,626
And, finally, you try to retain


1044
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:54,496
them as active subscribers by


1045
00:30:54,496 --> 00:30:54,976
minimizing churn.


1046
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,426
Now, we all know that during


1047
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,476
this lifecycle, there's a number


1048
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,116
of different billing events that


1049
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,416
can occur for most of your


1050
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,116
subscribers.


1051
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:11,236
And, today, you're probably


1052
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,586
calling the verifyReceipt


1053
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,396
endpoint for all your


1054
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:16,996
subscribers to get these billing


1055
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:17,716
event changes.


1056
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,716
Now, we know that this is not


1057
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,566
efficient, and can be costly


1058
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:25,256
over time, as your subscription


1059
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,016
business grows.


1060
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,696
But, the improvements that we


1061
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:30,746
saw earlier to Server-to-Server


1062
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,456
Notifications, you no longer


1063
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:35,256
have to rely on the receipts to


1064
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:36,906
reflect these billing event


1065
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:37,336
changes.


1066
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,076
So, let's talk more about how


1067
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:41,356
you can use the new


1068
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:42,936
Server-to-Server Notifications


1069
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:45,146
to detect these billing events,


1070
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,226
and build the best subscription


1071
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:48,736
experience for your customers.


1072
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:53,136
So, let's start with the initial


1073
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:54,476
purchase of a subscription.


1074
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:56,886
Now, we all know that this


1075
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:59,386
initial purchase unlocks content


1076
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:03,886
over a set period of time.


1077
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:05,236
When the customer purchases


1078
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:06,976
their subscription in your app,


1079
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:09,336
you will receive a transaction


1080
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,396
through StoreKit on the device,


1081
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,916
and a receipt associated to that


1082
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:14,496
transaction.


1083
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:19,056
At the same time, you'll receive


1084
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,916
a new notification called


1085
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,956
INITIAL BUY for this newly


1086
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:25,046
purchased subscription.


1087
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,916
Using this notification, you can


1088
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,146
identify a newly purchased


1089
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:31,576
subscriber that has never


1090
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:32,666
purchased your subscription


1091
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,066
before.


1092
00:32:35,816 --> 00:32:37,976
Now, you hang onto that initial


1093
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:40,276
buy notification JSON, and at


1094
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,926
the same time, you send your


1095
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,336
receipt from the device to your


1096
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,056
server over a secure connection.


1097
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:47,756
And then, to the verifyReceipt


1098
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:49,266
endpoint to validate the


1099
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:49,976
contents of the receipt.


1100
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,296
In the response that you get


1101
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,146
back from the App Store, you


1102
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,426
then check for the contents of


1103
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:01,836
the JSON, and you update your


1104
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:04,246
user database by looking for


1105
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:05,896
information for the latest


1106
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,966
purchase that the user made.


1107
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:11,316
Finally, that notification that


1108
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:13,166
you stored previously, you can


1109
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,256
link the response that you got


1110
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:16,856
from the App Store through this


1111
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:19,176
verifyReceipt, and link that to


1112
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:21,506
the initial buy notification by


1113
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:23,466
using original transaction id,


1114
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:24,976
and the web order line item id.


1115
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:32,706
Now, when the subscription is


1116
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,846
ready for renewal, the App Store


1117
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,126
will automatically renew the


1118
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,436
subscription for you in the


1119
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:37,976
background.


1120
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,336
And, the next time the user


1121
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:41,666
launches their app on the


1122
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,216
device, you'll receive a new


1123
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:45,646
transaction, and a receipt


1124
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,636
associated to that transaction.


1125
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:52,916
You, again, base64-encode that


1126
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:55,146
receipt, and send that securely


1127
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,106
to your server.


1128
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:59,736
And, let's say your user is


1129
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,426
consuming their service on a


1130
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:02,546
different platform, and you


1131
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:04,376
don't want to rely on the user


1132
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,386
launching the app to detect this


1133
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:06,816
renewal.


1134
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,746
You can also use the receipt


1135
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,266
data that you stored previously


1136
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,266
from the initial purchase, and


1137
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:13,976
send that to your server.


1138
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,585
Next, you send that to the


1139
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:23,376
verifyReceipt endpoint, and


1140
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:24,606
check for the renewal


1141
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,076
transaction in the JSON


1142
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:26,525
response.


1143
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,846
In the response, you can


1144
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:31,806
validate the latest renewal for


1145
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,525
that user, and you update the


1146
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,536
latest expires date, based on


1147
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:36,545
that subscription.


1148
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:40,916
And, finally, you keep service


1149
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,266
on for the customer as the


1150
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:43,396
subscription successfully


1151
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:43,896
renewed.


1152
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:47,626
Note that for this event, there


1153
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,786
is no server-to-server


1154
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,426
notification.


1155
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:51,326
So you have to call


1156
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:53,726
verifyReceipt based on the


1157
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,025
information that you have from


1158
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:57,566
the initial purchase to check


1159
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:58,726
for the renewal transaction.


1160
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:03,256
Now, let's say that the customer


1161
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,916
has been loving your service,


1162
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,176
and they enjoy their basic


1163
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:08,776
subscription service, and they


1164
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:10,976
decide to upgrade your service


1165
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,556
to your premium product, maybe a


1166
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:15,766
higher tier of service.


1167
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,636
Now, for this upgrade, you'll


1168
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:19,736
receive a CANCEL notification


1169
00:35:20,156 --> 00:35:21,366
from the App Store on your


1170
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:21,786
server.


1171
00:35:22,326 --> 00:35:27,146
And, in the content of the JSON,


1172
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:28,746
there will be a cancellation


1173
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:31,226
date notifying you that the App


1174
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:33,146
Store has canceled the previous


1175
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:34,396
subscription for the user.


1176
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:39,536
Followed by the CANCEL, you'll


1177
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:41,336
also receive an INTERACTIVE


1178
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,656
RENEWAL notification on your


1179
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:43,046
server.


1180
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:47,316
Use this notification to update


1181
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:50,156
your users' database with the


1182
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:51,426
date of the upgrade.


1183
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:53,096
So, now you know that this user


1184
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:55,596
has upgraded their subscription


1185
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,526
to a higher tier service, or a


1186
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:57,976
premium product.


1187
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:04,946
And, finally, you unlock the


1188
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,786
premium content for the user in


1189
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:06,976
the app.


1190
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:15,016
Now, at some point, the customer


1191
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:16,856
decides that this content isn't


1192
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:18,546
right for them, and they want to


1193
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:19,636
cancel their subscription.


1194
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,056
They do this by turning off


1195
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,536
auto-renew inside Manage


1196
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:27,206
Subscription settings on the


1197
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:28,416
device.


1198
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:31,246
Now, today, you might be relying


1199
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:33,886
on the receipt to reflect the


1200
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:34,966
latest renewal status.


1201
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,446
You may even be calling


1202
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,006
verifyReceipt for all your


1203
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:40,656
customers, just to get the


1204
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,376
renewal status of their latest


1205
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:42,916
subscription.


1206
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,696
Now, we talked about this


1207
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:47,236
earlier.


1208
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,066
Tori mentioned the new


1209
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,476
notification, by using that you


1210
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,296
no longer have to rely on


1211
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,106
verifyReceipt for that renewal


1212
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:55,866
status change.


1213
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:59,496
And now, you get the DID CHANGE


1214
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,936
RENEWAL STATUS notification any


1215
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,896
time a user turns off or on


1216
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,826
their auto-renew status from the


1217
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:06,966
Manage Subscriptions settings.


1218
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,396
You use this event to update the


1219
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:16,196
renewal status of the


1220
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,766
subscription to false, because


1221
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:19,246
in this case the user turned off


1222
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:19,946
auto-renew.


1223
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:22,876
And, you update their


1224
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,566
subscription status.


1225
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,886
Now, let's say that you don't


1226
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:29,676
receive any other notifications


1227
00:37:29,676 --> 00:37:31,836
for this user until the end of


1228
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:32,806
their subscription period.


1229
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,366
You can safely assume that their


1230
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:38,036
subscription has now churned at


1231
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:39,676
the end of their current


1232
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,046
subscription period.


1233
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:44,246
So, you can update the


1234
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:45,846
subscription status for your


1235
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:51,516
user as "inactive" or "churned."


1236
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:54,396
Now, over time, as your


1237
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,526
subscribers will churn out, you


1238
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,166
want to try and win them back by


1239
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,266
giving them an attractive offer,


1240
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,586
either a discounted price, or


1241
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:06,146
maybe even a free trial.


1242
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,336
We launched a new feature


1243
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:09,186
recently called Subscription


1244
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,226
Offers that allows you to give


1245
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,386
that discounted price, or a free


1246
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:15,506
trial, to keep existing


1247
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:16,936
subscribers, or win back


1248
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,966
previously churned subscribers.


1249
00:38:20,306 --> 00:38:21,236
We have a session on


1250
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,706
Subscription Offers later today,


1251
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:23,886
where my colleagues will go


1252
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,626
through best practices in


1253
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,646
implementing subscription


1254
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,006
offers.


1255
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,366
And, the different use cases on


1256
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,616
how you can use subscription


1257
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:31,756
offers to improve your retention


1258
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:31,976
numbers.


1259
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:37,986
Now, let's take a look at a


1260
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,026
slightly different case, where


1261
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,496
the user had no intention to


1262
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:42,336
cancel your subscription, but


1263
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,766
the App Store was unable to


1264
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,096
recover or renew the


1265
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:47,216
subscription on the user's


1266
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:47,536
behalf.


1267
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,356
Maybe the user's credit card was


1268
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:52,176
invalid, or maybe they did not


1269
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,636
have sufficient funds in their


1270
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:54,026
account.


1271
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:58,246
For this event, the App Store


1272
00:38:58,246 --> 00:39:00,346
will now send you a DID FAIL TO


1273
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,326
RENEW notification.


1274
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:04,736
Using this notification, you


1275
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,886
know that the user's


1276
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,966
subscription failed to renew due


1277
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,126
to a billing issue.


1278
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:11,446
And, you can update your


1279
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:13,026
subscription status for that


1280
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:15,056
customer to "inactive" or


1281
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:16,046
"churned."


1282
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,106
You use this notification to


1283
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:21,676
show them a message inside the


1284
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:22,916
app, letting them know that


1285
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:23,976
their subscription has expired.


1286
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,186
Now, for billing-related issues,


1287
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:32,486
the App Store automatically


1288
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:34,886
makes several attempts to renew


1289
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:36,206
the user's subscription over


1290
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:36,506
time.


1291
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,546
If an attempt succeeds, and if


1292
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,856
you're able to charge the


1293
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:42,446
customer for that subscription,


1294
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:45,266
you'll now receive a DID RECOVER


1295
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:45,976
notification.


1296
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,996
So, using this notification, you


1297
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,446
update the user database for


1298
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:52,896
that customer to "subscribed,"


1299
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,826
and you note the new expires


1300
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,966
date for that newly renewed


1301
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:00,946
subscription.


1302
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,566
And, you re-enable service for


1303
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:02,976
that customer.


1304
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:09,426
So, now we saw in the last


1305
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:11,066
example, that the App Store


1306
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:13,276
makes several attempts to renew


1307
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,766
subscriptions over a period of


1308
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:15,046
time.


1309
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,626
Now, this happens automatically


1310
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:21,576
for you, but how can you as a


1311
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:24,176
developer respond to these


1312
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,486
attempts, and what can you do on


1313
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:27,846
your end to reduce involuntary


1314
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:27,976
churn?


1315
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,026
Last year, in Engineering


1316
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:36,006
Subscriptions, we talked about


1317
00:40:36,006 --> 00:40:37,696
our extended billing re-try


1318
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:39,636
logic that attempts to renew the


1319
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,686
subscription over a period of


1320
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:44,266
time.


1321
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,816
This is deployed when a


1322
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:47,456
subscription fails to renew due


1323
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:48,256
to a billing issue.


1324
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:52,836
And, since launch, we have been


1325
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:54,506
making constant updates and


1326
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:56,496
tuning to our strategies to


1327
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,806
optimize recoveries.


1328
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,276
We're also looking at advanced


1329
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,066
machine learning models to


1330
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,666
improve how we recover


1331
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,176
subscriptions across the


1332
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:06,636
platform.


1333
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:10,876
Now, as we look at performance


1334
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,456
since launch, you can see that

of subscriptions that failed due

to a billing issue.


1338
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:22,416
And, by recovering these


1339
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,276
subscriptions, we have been able


1340
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,566
to reduce the overall


1341
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,336
involuntary churn to less than


1342
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:28,966
2% across the platform.

[ Applause ]


1344

And, with all these updates and


1345
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:40,556
improvements that we've made to


1346
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:41,946
our billing re-try strategies,


1347
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:45,406
we have been able to recover


1348
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,316
over 46 million of your


1349
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:47,976

[ Applause ]


1351
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,246
Now, these subscriptions would


1352
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:58,276
have churned otherwise, and


1353
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,086
users had no intention to cancel


1354
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:00,796
their service.


1355
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,956
Users were renewing and enjoying


1356
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,236
their service, and they did not


1357
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:04,946
want to cancel their


1358
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:05,446
subscription.


1359
00:42:06,336 --> 00:42:07,836
And, we see across the platform


1360
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,466
that more than half of these


1361
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:13,776
subscriptions are still active.


1362
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:15,536
Now, as we look at how we are


1363
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,016
recovering these subscriptions


1364
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,996
over time, over the period of 60


1365
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,046

1366
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:24,206
recover more than 77% of


1367
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:25,256
subscriptions that failed due to


1368
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:26,296
a billing issue over the period


1369
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:26,976
of 60 days.


1370

1373
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,906
So, what happens when we recover


1374
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:40,976
these subscriptions?


1375
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:45,476
First, you reenable service, as


1376
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,806
Tori mentioned earlier, with the


1377
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:47,876
new notifications.


1378
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,626
You may re-enable service for


1379
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,246
the customers next time that


1380
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:52,856
they try to access their


1381
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:53,646
service.


1382
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:56,726
We start a new billing cycle for


1383
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,556
that subscription from the date


1384
00:42:58,556 --> 00:42:58,976
of recovery.


1385
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,336
And, the days of paid service


1386
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:05,236
that the customers were


1387
00:43:05,236 --> 00:43:07,026
accumulating toward that higher


1388
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:09,666
revenue share, 85/15, resumes


1389
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:11,036
from that day of recovery.


1390
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:15,736

1391
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:17,766
to customers during this period


1392
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:19,926
from the day they started


1393
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:21,866
billing re-try to the day of


1394
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,686
recovery, you're probably


1395
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,406
missing out on revenue for those


1396
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:25,766
days.


1397
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:30,326
How can we improve that?


1398
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,056
So, this fall, I'm excited to


1399
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:35,096
announce that we're launching a


1400
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:37,226
new feature that will allow you


1401
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,756
to offer a grace period, a


1402
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:40,336
billing grace period, that


1403
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:42,086
allows additional time for


1404
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,906
customers while they're enjoying


1405
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:46,246
their service, they have access


1406
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:47,316
to that paid content.


1407
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,346
And, it allows you, the


1408
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:50,976
developer to get additional


1409
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,496
revenue for any service that you


1410
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,966
provide during those days.

experience for all your


1414
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:05,366
customers, who recovered


1415
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:07,516
naturally over a period of time,


1416
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:09,346
because they never expressed an


1417
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,126
intent to cancel.


1418
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,056
This also recovers customers who


1419
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:14,976
maybe had a temporary credit


1420
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:16,606
card hold on their account.


1421
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:21,066
Now, let's take a look at how


1422
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:22,436
you can implement this feature.


1423
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:24,336
Well, it's really easy.


1424
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:26,896
It takes three simple steps to


1425
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:29,006
implement a billing grace


1426
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:29,756
period.


1427
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:32,386
First, you opt-in via App Store


1428
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,536
Connect to offer pre-configured


1429
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:36,516
durations for grace period.


1430
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:39,086
Now, based on the recovery data


1431
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:41,126
that we saw earlier, we're going


1432
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:43,506
to start with 6 days for weekly


1433
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,996
subscriptions, and 16 days for


1434
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:47,006
all other durations.


1435
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:52,136
Next, you look for a new field


1436
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:54,046
in the verifyReceipt response,


1437
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:55,636
or in the notification.


1438
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:58,176
This will allow you to know the


1439
00:44:58,176 --> 00:44:59,786
latest expiry date for your


1440
00:44:59,786 --> 00:44:59,976
service.


1441
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:05,956
And, you keep service on for


1442
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:06,976
customers during the period.


1443
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:14,476
Now, you may be thinking, as a


1444
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,826
developer, why should you opt-in


1445
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:19,576
to offer a billing grace period?


1446
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:23,346
Well, there's a number of


1447
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:23,886
benefits.


1448
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,306
First, your customers never


1449
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,336
intended to cancel your


1450
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:29,716
subscription, so they enjoy


1451
00:45:29,716 --> 00:45:31,556
accessing your service without


1452
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:32,306
any interruptions.


1453
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:37,806
This also allows you, or your


1454
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:39,466
customers to maintain their


1455
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,256
existing billing cycle, as we


1456
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:42,356
recover their subscription


1457
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,696
during this billing grace


1458
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:43,986
period.


1459
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:47,776
And it enables you, the


1460
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:51,566
developer, to earn additional


1461
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:53,476
revenue for the service that you


1462
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:54,526
provide during this billing


1463
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:54,976
grace period.


1464
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,916
And, as we saw earlier, it


1465
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,656
allows customers to accumulate


1466
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:06,746
those 85/15 higher revenue share


1467
00:46:06,866 --> 00:46:08,626
days of paid service at a faster


1468
00:46:09,206 --> 00:46:09,306
rate.


1469
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:12,786
I highly encourage you to look


1470
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:14,176
into grace period for your


1471
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:15,856
subscriptions when we launch


1472
00:46:15,936 --> 00:46:19,306
this later this fall.


1473
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:21,676
Now, in addition to offering a


1474
00:46:21,676 --> 00:46:22,766
grace period, what are some of


1475
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,056
the other things that you can do


1476
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,566
to reduce overall involuntary


1477
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:28,116
churn, and improve recoveries?


1478
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:31,466
Here we see an example, where


1479
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,646
inside the app, by showing


1480
00:46:33,646 --> 00:46:35,596
contextual messaging to your


1481
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:37,916
customers who are in the billing


1482
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,616
re-try state, you can let them


1483
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:40,926
know that their subscription has


1484
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:41,826
failed to renew due to a billing


1485
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:41,916
issue.


1486
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:49,716
And, if you were offering a


1487
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,396
grace period, you can focus your


1488
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:54,116
messaging on any grace period


1489
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:55,206
service that you are providing


1490
00:46:55,206 --> 00:46:55,996
to your customers.


1491
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,486
Now, you can be creative with


1492
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:00,646
how you devise this messaging.


1493
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:02,726
It can be towards the end of the


1494
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:03,276
grace period.


1495
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:04,746
Maybe you are providing premium


1496
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:06,076
content, and they will lose


1497
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:07,386
content at the end of that grace


1498
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:07,636
period.


1499
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,616
So, highlighting the premium


1500
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:11,886
content that they're going to


1501
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:13,506
lose at the end of the grace


1502
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:15,326
period will help you recover


1503
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:16,276
those subscriptions.


1504
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:21,946
Here we see an app, Foodvisor,


1505
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:23,886
showing a message to customers


1506
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:26,386
in billing re-try, and showing


1507
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,146
them the remaining duration for


1508
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:32,336
the premium content.


1509
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,936
Now, within this message, you


1510
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,246
can also embed a deep link to


1511
00:47:37,246 --> 00:47:39,246
the payment details page, where


1512
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,806
the customers can then go and


1513
00:47:40,806 --> 00:47:41,976
resolve any billing issues.


1514
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,086
As you can see, we've recently


1515
00:47:48,086 --> 00:47:50,476
updated this Payment Details


1516
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:52,476
page to allow a customer to have


1517
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:53,996
up to 10 different payment


1518
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,806
methods on account.


1519
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:59,006
Now, in addition to providing


1520
00:47:59,146 --> 00:48:00,576
easier payment management


1521
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:02,926
options to customers, this also


1522
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:06,256
helps the App Store to reduce


1523
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,976
overall involuntary churn by


1524
00:48:08,976 --> 00:48:10,226
charging alternate payment


1525
00:48:10,226 --> 00:48:10,976
methods on file.


1526
00:48:18,236 --> 00:48:19,796
Now, we covered a lot of topics


1527
00:48:19,826 --> 00:48:20,996
today in this session.


1528
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:23,806
But, just to summarize, we


1529
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:25,916
talked about Subscription


1530
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,086
Offers, our new feature that we


1531
00:48:28,316 --> 00:48:30,616
launched recently that allows


1532
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,746
you to reduce voluntary churn by


1533
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,666
giving customers a discounted


1534
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:37,756
price, or a free trial to retain


1535
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:38,456
their subscription.


1536
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:41,406
Dana walked us through the code


1537
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:43,116
to implement a new API called


1538
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:45,226
SKStorefront which you can use


1539
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:47,106
to display the right content to


1540
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:49,326
your customers around the world.


1541
00:48:52,256 --> 00:48:53,776
We talked about some receipt


1542
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,356
changes that are coming soon,


1543
00:48:55,586 --> 00:48:57,566
that allow you to reward your


1544
00:48:57,566 --> 00:48:58,916
loyal customers who pre-ordered


1545
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,496
the app, maybe by giving them a


1546
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:02,346
starting balance of a game.


1547
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,406
And, if you haven't already done


1548
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:06,456
this, check out the


1549
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:08,006
Server-to-Server Notifications,


1550
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:10,596
and add that URL in App Store


1551
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:12,756
Connect to get notified for the


1552
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:13,896
billing events from the App


1553
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:14,166
Store.


1554
00:49:15,646 --> 00:49:17,096
We talked about grace period,


1555
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:18,376
and how you can provide a


1556
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:20,456
billing grace period to improve


1557
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:22,826
recoveries for customers that


1558
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:23,966
their subscriptions failed to


1559
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:25,006
renew because of a billing


1560
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:25,746
issue.


1561
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,596
And, we talked about contextual


1562
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:31,356
messaging, that you can display


1563
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:33,286
inside the app to recover more


1564
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:34,256
of your subscriptions.


1565
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:37,576
For more information on this


1566
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:39,736
session, and the video for this


1567
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:42,566
session, look up Session 302.


1568
00:49:42,986 --> 00:49:44,816
And, later this afternoon, my


1569
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,276
colleagues will talk about


1570
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:47,506
subscription offers best


1571
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:48,246
practices.


1572
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,306
They'll tell you how to


1573
00:49:49,306 --> 00:49:50,696
implement subscription offers,


1574
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,566
and the different use cases for


1575
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:54,246
using subscription offers to


1576
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:55,826
reduce voluntary churn.


1577
00:49:56,356 --> 00:49:58,546
And, we'll be around in the lab


1578
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:00,696
to answer any questions you may


1579
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:01,976
have about these features.


1580
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:06,086
Thank you and have a great rest


1581
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:06,966
of your afternoon.
