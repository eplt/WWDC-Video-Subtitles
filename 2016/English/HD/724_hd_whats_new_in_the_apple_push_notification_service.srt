00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:25,336
>> Welcome to the
session 724 on What's New


3
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,516
in Apple Push Notification
Service.


4
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:29,886
My name is Mayur Mahajan.


5
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:35,006
And I work on the Apple Push
Notification Service, or APNS.


6
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:39,846
And I'm excited to share with
you what's coming to APNS.


7
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:45,716
Let's get started with a review
of important enhancements


8
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:47,036
that were released last year.


9
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:52,416
First, we introduced a brand
new provider protocol based


10
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,236
on HTTP/2 persistent Pushes.


11
00:00:56,076 --> 00:01:01,166
HTTP/2 is a binary protocol
that supports multiple streams


12
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,836
over a single connection
and is extremely fast.


13
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:08,506
The new protocol has
made it very easy


14
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,436
to send Push notifications
to their devices.


15
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:16,456
The new protocol supports
providing instant feedback


16
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:20,576
to indicate which device
tokens are no longer active.


17
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:25,466
It is also possible to
send larger payloads,


18
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:29,226
up to four kilobytes, that
you can take advantage


19
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:31,706
of for creating rich
applications.


20
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:36,696
In addition, we'll simplify
the certificate handling


21
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:41,996
so you will now have to maintain
fewer client certificates used


22
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,786
to connect to APNS.


23
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:48,026
We have received a lot
of positive feedback


24
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,366
from the developer community.


25
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,776
We deliver hundreds of thousands


26
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:55,786
of notifications per second
using this new protocol.


27
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:59,796
If you are not using this
already you should definitely


28
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:00,766ddle
try it.


29
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:00,766
try it.


30
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:07,436
So let's recap the sequence
of steps that are involved


31
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:09,076
in sending Push notifications.


32
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,956
On the bottom right is
your client application.


33
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:16,736
And on the top right
is the provider,


34
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:20,836
which is the server component
that connects to APNS


35
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,156
and sends Push notifications.


36
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:27,166
Now, before you start
sending notifications,


37
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:30,356
you should register
for Push notifications


38
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:31,826
in the developer account.


39
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:37,216
The application will register
with the operating system,


40
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,916
running on the device
on the bottom left.


41
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,836
The device will request
a token from APNS


42
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,936
on behalf of the application.


43
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,686
And then return it back
to your application.


44
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,846
This device token will be unique


45
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:56,606
for your application
running on this device.


46
00:02:57,126 --> 00:03:02,056
Your application should forward
this token to the provider.


47
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,286
Now, the provider
service will connect


48
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,566
to APNS using the
client certificate


49
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:14,166
and then use standard
HTTP/2 post request


50
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,076
to send a Push to
that device token.


51
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:26,616
HTTP/2 provider API will provide
an immediate response indicating


52
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,866
success if everything was okay.


53
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:32,686
And APNS has received
and validated


54
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:35,686
that the Push request
is [inaudible].


55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,296
Now, if there was an error, say
the device token is not valid,


56
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:47,456
APNS will return an error
status 400, or "invalid request"


57
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,856
with adjacent payload
indicating the reason.


58
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,356
For example, a bad device token.


59
00:03:54,916 --> 00:04:00,486
The new provider protocol also
provides instant feedback.


60
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,726
So if a device token
has been removed,


61
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:10,276
you will get an HTTP/2 response
with status 410, or "removed."


62
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:15,386
It will have a time stamp
in payload indicating


63
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:20,396
when APNS last learned that the
device token has been removed.


64
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:27,306
We also simplified
certificate handling as part


65
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,006
of the new provider protocol.


66
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:33,196
You can now provision
a single certificate


67
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:38,536
for your application,
complication, and VoiP Pushes.


68
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:44,176
The same certificate can
be used in both development


69
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,016
and production environments.


70
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,046
This has reduced the
headaches of managing, renewing


71
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:54,046
and revocation of
multiple certificates


72
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,386
for many developers.


73
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,966
Now, we are listening
to feedback


74
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,436
from developers like you.


75
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,936
And we understand the importance


76
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,966
of simplifying the work
flow that's involved


77
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,786
in sending Push notifications.


78
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:12,696
We understand that managing
certificates is too complex


79
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,036
for some applications.


80
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:20,246
So today we are thrilled
to announce a brand new


81
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:24,726
and a simple way of
authenticating against APNS.


82
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,706
Introducing token authentication


83
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,566
for Apple Push notification
service.


84
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:40,596
Token authentication is a way
of using provider tokens instead


85
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:44,186
of client certificate when
sending notifications.


86
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,466
The authentication
tokens are intended


87
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,056
to simplify how services
connect to APNS.


88
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:59,606
In addition, the tokens are easy
to generate programmatically,


89
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,316
so there is no need
to worry about having


90
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,596
to reissue expiring
certificates.


91
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:11,086
This is enabled through
the use of JSON Web tokens


92
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,396
as a mechanism to generate
authentication credentials.


93
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:20,826
There are a number of libraries
widely available for use


94
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:23,536
with the programming
language of your choice


95
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:25,076
to generate these tokens.


96
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:29,746
Now, before we get
into the details


97
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,326
of how token authentication
works,


98
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:36,436
let's first recap how
certificate authentication


99
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:37,306
will work.


100
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:40,546
You opt in.


101
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:46,746
Provide a client certificate
from your developer account.


102
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,056
When connecting to APNS
using mutual authentication,


103
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,156
APNS will provide a
server certificate


104
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:58,786
that you will trust
and validate.


105
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,666
As part of the handshake,


106
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,816
your provider will also
sign the client certificate,


107
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:11,306
which APNS will validate and
use to establish credentials.


108
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:16,216
At this point, there is a
trusted connection established


109
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:19,066
between APNS and the provider.


110
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:24,076
Any Pushes you send on this
connection are attached


111
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:28,000
to the application identified
by the client certificate.


112
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:35,716
When using token
authentication, you should opt


113
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,606
in a token sign-in
key from the account.


114
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:43,676
Your provider will then
establish a PLS connection


115
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,816
without a client certificate.


116
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:49,526
However, before sending
notifications


117
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:54,176
on this connection, the provider
will construct an authentication


118
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,286
token that includes
your team ID.


119
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:02,066
And then sign it using
the key opt indicator.


120
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,046
Now it's possible to
send notifications


121
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:10,926
on this connection.


122
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:16,996
Every notification message
that's signed must include the


123
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,026
authentication token.


124
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:23,766
Also, the application topic
should be part of this request.


125
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:29,976
APNS will first authenticate
the provider using the token


126
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,486
and then process the request.


127
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:37,716
If this request is
processed successfully,


128
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:43,566
APNS will send a response
back indicating success.


129
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:47,896
If no token was provided
with the request


130
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,236
or if the token was invalid,


131
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:54,616
a response will be sent
back indicating the error.


132
00:08:55,166 --> 00:09:01,796
As a reminder, APNS will not
close the connection on error.


133
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,926
So let's take a look at how
to generate a provider token.


134
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:11,926
You should start with
provisioning a sign-in key


135
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:15,616
from the certificates,
identities


136
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:18,126
and profile section
in the account.


137
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:23,716
A public-private
keypad is generated.


138
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,456
And the private key
can then be used


139
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:31,366
to cryptographically
sign the token data.


140
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,196
Apple will use the
corresponding public key


141
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,576
for validating the token.


142
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,206
Next, let's look at how
you construct the token.


143
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:51,336
At the top is an example of what
a JSON Web token that's part


144
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,766
of the request might look like.


145
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,566
Let's go over the structure
of this JSON Web token.


146
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,786
You can see it has three parts.


147
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:09,606
Each part is a URL friendly
base-64 encoded string that's


148
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,906
delimited by a period.


149
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:15,566
Below is the decoded
representation


150
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,636
of this Web token.


151
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,616
The first part is the header.


152
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,856
And it includes attributes


153
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:27,936
that specify the algorithm
used to sign the token.


154
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:31,866
In our case, it's ES256.


155
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:38,036
It will also include the
key identifier for the key


156
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,116
that is used to sign the token.


157
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:47,076
The claims section will
include an assurer tribute,


158
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:50,596
which is your developer team ID


159
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,226
that can be obtained
from the account.


160
00:10:53,696 --> 00:11:00,016
The next attribute in the claims
is initial time stamp that's


161
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:03,066
expressed as seconds
since epoch.


162
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:07,696
The last part of the token
is simply the signature


163
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:11,726
in base 64 obtained by
applying the signing algorithm


164
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,146
to the header and the claims.


165
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:17,856
This prevents any
unauthorized tampering


166
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,000
of the token once
it is generated.


167
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,666
Here is what an HTTP/2 creates


168
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:31,866
for a request using token
authentication will look like.


169
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:37,036
As you can see, this
request contains a header


170
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,036
and a data frame.


171
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,586
The header frame consists


172
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:44,306
of various header fields
including APNS topic.


173
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:50,016
Now, you will notice that the
header frame now includes an


174
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:54,896
authorization header with
the value "bearer" followed


175
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,476
by the signed provider token.


176
00:11:57,036 --> 00:12:02,896
If the request including the
authentication token is valid,


177
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:07,386
the response will be
status 200 or "OK."


178
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,106
Here is what the
response will look


179
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,316
if the provider token
was not valid.


180
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:21,876
In this case, it is
status 403, or "Forbidden."


181
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:28,186
Now, APNS will require
that new tokens be


182
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:29,506
periodically generated.


183
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:36,926
If the token is too old,
the response will, again,


184
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,096
be a 403 "Forbidden" error
with reason indicating


185
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,036
that the token has expired.


186
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:51,406
APNS will require that the
token creation time must be


187
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,396
within the last hour.


188
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:59,196
However, a new token should not
be generated on every request.


189
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,176
In fact, for performance
we recommend


190
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,486
that the token be reused
as long as it is valid.


191
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:15,226
So here are a few more details
regarding token authentication.


192
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:20,676
As mentioned earlier,
the provider tokens need


193
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,286
to be generated periodically.


194
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:27,296
However, note that the
sign-in key does not expire.


195
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:32,356
Now, if you suspect that the
sign-in key may have been


196
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:36,556
compromised, you can revoke
the key from your account


197
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,826
and provision a new key.


198
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:44,166
As a reminder, APNS
will continue


199
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,236
to support certificate
authentication.


200
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,716
So that is token authentication.


201
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:54,366
And it's coming later this year.


202
00:13:54,946 --> 00:14:01,196
