00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:17,500
[ Music ]


2
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:24,946
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,126
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,686
>> Welcome to Session 303.


5
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,116
I'm Todd Fernandez.


6
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,146
And I'm very pleased to be
here with you this morning


7
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:35,316
to give you an update on what's
new in managing Apple devices.


8
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,566
Now, before we begin,
I do have to warn you


9
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,286
that I am still a
little bit tired


10
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:42,406
after attending my college
reunion last weekend.


11
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,676
And I'm not going to
tell you which one,


12
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,386
but if it had been
an anniversary,


13
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,636
I would have received
some silver.


14
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,616
Now, despite being a little
tired, I'm very grateful


15
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:54,336
to see you all here in the hall,
but I also want to give a shout


16
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:56,696
out to all of you watching the
live stream around the world,


17
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,046
as well as you future viewers
watching this recording


18
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,306
at some indefinite period
like some three-eyed raven.


19
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:04,956
Hello, future viewers.


20
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,236
But speaking of the
passage of time --


21
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,926
no, not that kind of time,


22
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,366
although I do love
my Apple Watch --


23
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,256
I want to talk about
the calendar.


24
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:21,406
Now, many of you here in the
hall today the spring may seem


25
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:23,446
like a quiet time for
device management.


26
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,216
As we toil behind the scenes
on all the new capabilities


27
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:31,326
that we're going to
announce and preview at WWDC


28
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,406
and then ship in
our fall releases.


29
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,696
But it turns out
surprisingly enough


30
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:38,276
that schools actually want


31
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,986
to use those features
before we typically ship our


32
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:41,816
fall releases.


33
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,626
They want to configure
devices taking advantage


34
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,886
of all those new
features over the summer


35
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,916
for use during the
next school year.


36
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,036
But in order to do that,


37
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,836
they need to have already
purchased their hardware


38
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,436
and software even earlier.


39
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,436
And in order to do that, they
need to have evaluated all


40
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,786
of the new hardware, software,
and tools options even earlier.


41
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,856
Which brings us to iOS 9.3.


42
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:08,466
It's really strange how
that release date just kind


43
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,526
of jumped right out at us.


44
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,996
But the schedule isn't
the interesting part;


45
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:14,176
what about the features?


46
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,226
There are a ton of new
features that we released


47
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,866
in our spring software
and service releases.


48
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,726
But the true stars of the
show are clearly Apple School


49
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,476
Manager, Shared iPad,
and Classroom.


50
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,076
Let's first talk a little bit
about Apple School Manager,


51
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,126
which provides a
streamlined enrollment process


52
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,516
to access Apple's device
management services.


53
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,796
Those services include
creating accounts for students


54
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,986
and teachers, as well as
the class relationships


55
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:44,796
between them, configuring how
their devices will be enrolled


56
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:48,296
for remote management, and
purchasing the apps and books


57
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,856
and creating the curriculum
that will help students learn.


58
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:55,636
And fortunately, one of the
technology directors at one


59
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:56,396
of the school districts


60
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:59,496
which piloted these features
earlier this year agrees


61
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,206
that Apple School Manager will
save their tech staff lots


62
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,366
of time, allowing them to
manage devices, content,


63
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,286
and our student accounts
all from one place,


64
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:08,866
exactly what we intended.


65
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,556
Now let's turn to Shared iPad.


66
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:16,386
Shared iPad allows the majority
of schools in the United States


67
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,736
and around the world
which share devices


68
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,286
to provide their students
with a personalized experience


69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,396
and enable them to use the
complete Apple ecosystem.


70
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,216
Shared iPad can be configured so
that younger students can sign


71
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,176
in by simply tapping
on their photo


72
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,806
and entering a four-digit
pass code.


73
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,996
Student data is stored in
the Cloud and downloaded


74
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:42,466
to a specific iPad when
they sign in as needed.


75
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:47,676
Again, it's great to see that
the folks who are responsible


76
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:51,016
for getting these Shared iPads
into the students' hands agree


77
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:54,326
that Shared iPad will allow our
district to transform a cart


78
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,156
of shared devices


79
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:57,846
into a personalized learning
experience for each student.


80
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,316
Again, nailed it.


81
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:00,856
All right.


82
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,456
Finally, Classroom.


83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,286
Classroom empowers
teachers to keep themselves


84
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,456
and their students
focused on learning,


85
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,256
rather than managing technology
by placing a small set


86
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:15,366
of key capabilities at
their fingertips right


87
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,166
in the classroom.


88
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:22,076
Teachers can easily open an app
or a chapter in an iBook on all


89
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:26,076
or a selected group of student
devices, project student work


90
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:31,256
to the Classroom Apple TV, or
monitor and redirect a student


91
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,406
who may be off task even
while they're working


92
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,766
with a different group of
students across the classroom.


93
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:39,006
And I was very fortunate


94
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,426
to visit Mr. Garcia's
classroom a few months ago,


95
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,956
and it was truly inspiring
to see the projects


96
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:46,326
that his students were
working on their Shared iPads


97
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,306
with his support
using Classroom.


98
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,476
And after his experience
he reports


99
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,776
that Classroom has been an
extremely useful tool throughout


100
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,646
the school day to enhance the
project-based learning that's


101
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,886
going on his classroom.


102
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,646
Classroom helps him to keep
all of his students accountable


103
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,616
for their work while also
keeping them extremely engaged


104
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:04,566
in their assignments.


105
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,836
Now while it's extremely
gratifying to get this kind


106
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:11,146
of response to the features we
released, it's also been great


107
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,916
to hear some great feedback
about their quality,


108
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,336
including from some very
difficult to impress customers


109
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,336
who have raved about the blazing
performance and reliability


110
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,536
of Classroom's features.


111
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:26,836
Now, these spring 2016 changes


112
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,056
with an extremely
well-received feature set


113
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,556
and high quality
delivered on a schedule


114
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,596
which schools need
underline Apple's commitment


115
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:37,116
to deliver not only
the best devices


116
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,026
and most advanced
operating systems


117
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,736
but also the best device
management experience.


118
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:46,056
We've demonstrated this
commitment by investing heavily


119
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,566
in providing a great experience


120
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,156
to schools bringing Apple
devices into their classrooms.


121
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:53,536
But we need all of our
partners, from NDM vendors


122
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,616
to tool providers, to all of you
app developers who would love


123
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:59,016
to see your app used by
thousands of students


124
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:02,216
around the world to
join with us to ensure


125
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,056
that that great experience
reaches all


126
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,436
of our joint customers
all over the world.


127
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,816
But I do want to
encourage to you keep


128
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,456
up because although we don't
talk about future products,


129
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:13,906
we are definitely not done yet.


130
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:18,966
So today I'm going to cover
all of the new developments


131
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,046
across the entire device
management life cycle.


132
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,686
So let's go ahead
and get started.


133
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:28,146
I'll cover a few changes to
some existing features and go


134
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,096
into some detail
about the new things


135
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,236
like Apple School Manager,
Managed Apple IDs, and,


136
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,666
of course, Shared iPad.


137
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:39,356
So first I want to cover a few
things that haven't changed.


138
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,346
For Enterprise customers we
still have the Apple deployment


139
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,326
programs, the Device
Enrollment Program


140
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:47,366
for configuring how your devices
enroll for remote management,


141
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,856
as well as the volume purchase
program for purchasing your apps


142
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,706
and books and distributing them
to your devices and your users.


143
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,546
However, we've also
added a number


144
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,056
of new device management
commands and settings


145
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,476
in the spring and
that I'm going to talk


146
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,606
about later in this session.


147
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:05,736
And we'll try to highlight those
that are specific interests


148
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:08,516
to Enterprise customers, though
many of the things we've done


149
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,226
for education also are
useful in Enterprise.


150
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,026
Turning to education,
now let's talk


151
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,986
about Apple School
Manager in more detail.


152
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:21,056
As I mentioned, it allows the
school to manage the people,


153
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:25,426
the devices, and the content the
school is managing to deliver


154
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,566
that improved performance
in the classroom.


155
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,196
With respect to getting
those accounts created,


156
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:35,666
there are two options: You can
connect Apple School Manager


157
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,676
to your student information
system to pull


158
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,136
out all the student,
teacher, and staff,


159
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:44,686
and relationship information;
alternatively, you can upload


160
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,246
that information
using a CSV template.


161
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:51,006
Once Apple School Manager
has that information,


162
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,926
it creates managed Apple IDs
for each student and teacher,


163
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,786
as well as creating classes
that have those relationships


164
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,516
between which teachers have
which students in their classes.


165
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,626
What are those managed
Apple IDs?


166
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,246
Well, they're used both
by the school staff


167
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,026
as administer accounts


168
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,646
and accommodate tiered
administration


169
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,486
so that different administers
can have different privileges


170
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:20,176
for managing your school's
people, content, and devices.


171
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,676
The student accounts have a
few special characteristics.


172
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,206
They're required to
sign into a Shared iPad,


173
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:31,456
but they can be used for
one-to-one deployments as well.


174
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:35,346
And in Apple School Manager
you can configure the pass code


175
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:37,006
options for Managed Apple ID


176
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,905
from the full-strength iCloud
password to a simpler four


177
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,586
or six-digit pass code.


178
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,786
Managed Apple IDs are
special in another way


179
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,176
in that some services are
disabled, such as commerce,


180
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:52,326
so that students using a Managed
Apple ID cannot purchase things


181
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:53,156
from our stores.


182
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,796
There are also services such
as FaceTime and iMessage


183
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,116
which can be enabled


184
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,216
if the school decides they
would like to use them.


185
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:02,756
All right.


186
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,346
For you NDM vendors
out there, of course,


187
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,596
just as with the Device
Enrollment Program


188
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,996
and the volume purchase
program, there's an API


189
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,386
to access this roster
information


190
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,076
from Apple School Manager and
give your NDM solution access


191
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,666
to all the student and
teacher Managed Apple IDs,


192
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,206
as well as the classes.


193
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,106
In terms of the transition
from schools moving


194
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,996
from the Apple deployment
programs


195
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,786
to Apple School Manager,
the good news for them is


196
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,036
that they do not need
to download new tokens.


197
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,586
It will continue to work.


198
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:37,686
But your NDM solution needs to
be ready for this transition


199
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:42,446
and be checking to see if their
token is now an Apple School


200
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:45,356
Manager type and
supports the new v3 API,


201
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:48,216
which will actually be
what gives you access


202
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,856
to the roster service
information.


203
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:53,756
On a parallel track,
when you're interacting


204
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:57,256
with the Device Enrollment
Program service, you can tell it


205
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,856
that you now support
API v3 by including


206
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,086
that information in the header.


207
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,496
And you'll receive the
additional information that's


208
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,996
now available via that API.


209
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:09,876
I also wanted to pass
along a few best practices


210
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,006
that my team has learned


211
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,326
in adopting this API
in Profile Manager.


212
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,456
The first is really a
strong recommendation


213
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,596
that we think your customers
will really appreciate.


214
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,836
If they have been using
your product for a while,


215
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:24,556
they've undoubtedly connected it
to their directory to get user


216
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:28,026
and group information so
that your solution also has a


217
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,616
representation for each user.


218
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,936
Once you connect up to
the roster service API


219
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:34,986
in Apple School Manager,
you're going


220
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,006
to be getting a second
representation of each user


221
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,376
in the form of the
Managed Apple ID.


222
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:41,856
And we recommend that you
allow the administrator


223
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,476
to provide some matching
criteria


224
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,526
so that you can automatically
merge those accounts


225
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,746
into one representation of
each student and teacher.


226
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:54,216
And because that matching won't
catch every single record,


227
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:58,076
we think you also should allow
manual merging of records


228
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,196
to be able to tell you this
directory user is the same user


229
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:02,416
as this Managed Apple ID.


230
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,636
One special note about
records that have been created


231
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:12,096
by CSV uploads is that the
person number that's uploaded


232
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,426
in the CSV template becomes
the source system identifier


233
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,496
in the API results
that you will receive.


234
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,056
That source system identifier
corresponds to something more


235
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,476
like a student ID; it's not
a GUID or a primary key.


236
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,136
So that field can
actually be mutable


237
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,796
and is not guaranteed
to be unique.


238
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,756
And you need to be
prepared for that case.


239
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:34,906
The final practice I wanted
to pass along was to point


240
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,306
out that there is no delta
API so that you'll need


241
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,556
to do a full enumeration to get
all of the records from the API.


242
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,956
Since the student information
system syncing is only performed


243
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,606
once per day between it
and Apple School Manager,


244
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,946
there's no need to automatically
perform a full sync more


245
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:51,936
than that frequency.


246
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:56,186
And in fact, if you give
your users an opportunity


247
00:11:56,186 --> 00:12:00,956
to request a sync, you're going
to need to throttle that so


248
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,686
that they're not overwhelming
your product and our system.


249
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:09,236
Turning from people to devices,
Apple School Manager allows you


250
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,306
to configure the Device
Enrollment Program settings


251
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,546
for your school's devices,


252
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,666
including finding
your purchases,


253
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,266
configuring the details
of your MDM servers,


254
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,826
and then assigning devices
to those MDM servers so that


255
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,156
when they're enrolled they'll
be managed by those servers.


256
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,966
And finally content.


257
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,356
Apple School Manager
allows you to jump


258
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:31,016
to the Volume Purchase
Program store to buy your apps


259
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,726
and books, and it
also offers access


260
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,216
to iTunes U Course Manager.


261
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:36,846
And I also wanted to mention


262
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:39,446
that we recently
released iTunes U 3.3


263
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:42,576
which now supports integration
with Apple School Manager


264
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:45,096
to pull managed course
information into iTunes U.


265
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:50,696
Now let's talk about some of
the other details of enrollment


266
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,126
to getting your devices
ready for remote management.


267
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,116
Last year I talked
about a new feature


268
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,796
in iOS 9 called enrollment
optimization.


269
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:05,716
And just a recap this allows
the MDM server to include a bit


270
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:08,286
in the Device Enrollment
Program settings for a device


271
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,386
that I want to you wait


272
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,546
until I'm done configuring
before allowing the user


273
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,436
to use the device.


274
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,916
That setting comes down to
the Mac or the iOS device


275
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,236
in their DEP settings.


276
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:21,516
It then sends a token
update with device ID back


277
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,956
to the MDM server,
letting it know


278
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,256
that I'm ready to be configured.


279
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:27,426
The MDM server can then
send as many commands,


280
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,236
install as many configuration
profiles as needed to bring


281
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:33,336
that device up to
spec. When it's done,


282
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,906
it then sends a device
configured command


283
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,396
to the device, which then
exits the Setup Assistant


284
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,286
and allows the student or the
employee to use the device.


285
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,756
This enables the
organization to ensure


286
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,416
that that device is not used
prior to being fully configured.


287
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,716
Now that we have Shared iPad,
there's a new wrinkle here


288
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,736
in that there's a new
action in users signing in.


289
00:13:56,276 --> 00:14:00,146
At that point the Shared iPad
will send a token update back


290
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:00,996
to the MDM server.


291
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,326
But in contrast to
the one I just talked


292
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,836
about that's device-specific,


293
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,016
this token update reports
the Managed Apple ID


294
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,946
for the user who signed in.


295
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:14,426
That enables the MDM server to
send, again, as many commands


296
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,096
as it needs to configure
that device


297
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,236
with any per-user
settings, which I will go


298
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,156
into a bit more later.


299
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:25,066
One crucial difference between
this Shared iPad feature


300
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:28,086
and the device-specific
enrollment optimization is


301
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:31,576
that unlike the prior one
which waits in Setup Assistant


302
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,516
until the MDM server is
done, the user is not blocked


303
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:39,096
from completing sign in
until the MDM server is done.


304
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,786
A few security best practices.


305
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:46,516
Those of you who have
been keeping up will know


306
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:52,386
that we removed support for MD5
in iOS 9.3 for SCEP servers.


307
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:57,236
We've also deprecated DES,
but we also added AES support.


308
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:01,946
So the message here is that your
SCEP servers should support 3DES


309
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,496
or AES as soon as
possible because we want


310
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,036
to be using the most
secure cryptography possible


311
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,526
and it's time to move
on to the modern ones.


312
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,776
Next, a few details about
configuring the Setup Assistant,


313
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,446
one of the other features of
the Device Enrollment Program.


314
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,736
In iOS 9.3.2 we now allow you


315
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:25,156
to skip the new True Tone
display Setup Assistant pane


316
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,676
on hardware which
has that display.


317
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:32,126
And new in macOS Sierra, we
have some great new features,


318
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,786
but in fact you might
not want your users


319
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,286
to configure them during setup.


320
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:38,976
So you can skip the Siri or
the iCloud desktop setup pane.


321
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:43,046
Now, this is another
advertisement.


322
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:45,246
I think I've done this now,
this is the third year running


323
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:48,186
for you MDM vendors to
support MDMServiceConfig,


324
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,646
which allows tools
like Configurator


325
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,256
to obtain information
about your MDM server,


326
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,066
such as the DEP enrollment
URL or where


327
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,836
to fetch the anchor certs.


328
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,426
Profile Manager has supported
this for some time now


329
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:05,256
and Apple Configurator 2 takes
advantage of it, enabling users


330
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,766
to simply enter the host
name of your MDM server


331
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,576
and Configurator does the rest.


332
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,456
Now let's talk about
Shared iPad.


333
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,046
Of course, this brings
support for multiple users


334
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,476
to iPad in the classroom.


335
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,126
A few details about
installing apps on them.


336
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,476
And then I want to talk a
little bit about the details


337
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:25,806
of how it preserves user data.


338
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:29,576
As I mentioned earlier,


339
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,166
Shared iPad requires a
Managed Apple ID to sign into.


340
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,976
Once a student signs in
with her Managed Apple ID,


341
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:40,796
she is also signed into her
iCloud account for data storage,


342
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,016
as well as her iTunes
account for assigning books,


343
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:47,206
which I'll talk about
in a minute.


344
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:49,526
It's also used for
supporting iTunes U.


345
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,346
Now, since there isn't
always an Apple ID signed


346
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:58,306
into a Shared iPad,
you'll want to deploy apps


347
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,086
and install them using device
assignments, which we added


348
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,966
to VPP managed distribution
last fall in iOS 9.


349
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,425
MDM vendors hopefully have all
added support for this already,


350
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,596
but you'll need to use
the newer PurchaseMethod 1


351
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,195
to support device assignments.


352
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,526
All app types are
supported from VPP apps


353
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,955
to [inaudible] apps
to Enterprise apps.


354
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:21,886
Although in order to distribute
VPP apps via device assignments,


355
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:24,726
the developer of that app must
have accepted the latest T's


356
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,326
and C's in iTunes Connect
to allow device assignment.


357
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:30,806
Now let's talk a little bit


358
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,866
about the underlying
architecture.


359
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:36,056
As I mentioned, the student
data is kept in the Cloud --


360
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,076
that's where the truth is.


361
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,186
But once they've signed into
a particular Shared iPad,


362
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,386
their data is downloaded
and cached there.


363
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,816
However, that cache
may be purged


364
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,046
if additional students need


365
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,736
to be accommodated
on that Shared iPad.


366
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,726
Each student can only
see his or her own data.


367
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,906
But if they generate a lot
of data during a session


368
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,516
and they sign out before all


369
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,706
of that data has successfully
uploaded to the Cloud,


370
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,586
Shared iPad will continue to
upload that data at the log


371
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,866
in screen or even if
other students sign in.


372
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,146
The key to all this
working is that all


373
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,656
of your apps are
education ready.


374
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:14,336
That primarily means that you're
storing all of your app's data


375
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,706
and settings in the Cloud.


376
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,776
We've got a whole session right
after lunch about how best


377
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,386
to make your app education
ready right here in this room,


378
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,156
and I encourage you
come back for that one.


379
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,716
Now, just kind of animation
to explain this a bit better.


380
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,276
Student enters her pass code.


381
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,456
Shared iPad gets her
to the log in screen --


382
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,696
to the Home screen, excuse me.


383
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:38,966
Downloads her data.


384
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,866
See, she's working on her
project, but now it's time


385
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,766
to sign out, to go
to the next class,


386
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:45,566
or to go home for the day.


387
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:53,886
Even back at the login screen
her data continues uploading.


388
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,466
Maybe she was working
on a movie project.


389
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,066
But even if another
student then signs in


390
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,886
and begins downloading his data,


391
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:05,206
the previous student's
data continues uploading


392
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,136
until it's all safely
stored in the Cloud.


393
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:11,356
But the next student can
begin using the Shared iPad


394
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:11,826
right away.


395
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,046
So what do you MDM vendors need
to do to support Shared iPad?


396
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,116
Again, hopefully all of
you have done this already.


397
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:22,326
but for those of you who
may be a little bit behind,


398
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:26,136
there's a new setting in the
DEP settings very similar


399
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:29,756
to supervision that tells
the device enter Shared iPad.


400
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,446
You also will want to use
Enrollment Optimization


401
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,916
that I talked about earlier


402
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,556
to set some key options
before student use.


403
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,186
And I'm going to go
into a bit more detail


404
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,566
about both user quota and
lock screen grace period.


405
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:45,866
So what is the user quota?


406
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,526
Well, it's the maximum
number of the users


407
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,436
which will be cached
locally at any one time.


408
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,706
Let's say six.


409
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,776
iOS will then automatically
calculate how much storage


410
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,876
should be allocated
each of those six users,


411
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,706
taking into account
space reserved for iOS,


412
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,696
as well as books and apps
that you're going to install.


413
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:08,246
As users log in, their
data is downloaded


414
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,306
and cached on the Shared iPad.


415
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,926
But in this case with a quota of
six, if a seventh user signs in,


416
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:19,006
one of the user data
caches will be purged.


417
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:22,156
And we will purge the
least recently used user


418
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,036
who doesn't have any
data still remaining


419
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,026
to upload to the Cloud.


420
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:29,616
Some guidelines on how to choose
this value, you really want


421
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,766
to try to get it close to
what the number of students


422
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,176
who will actually use the
Shared iPad during the day,


423
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,826
which will typically
be the number


424
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,116
of class periods
you have in a day.


425
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,976
Because if you have too few,


426
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,376
students will have their
data purged more often


427
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,136
than necessary.


428
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,656
And if you choose a number
too large, you're going


429
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:50,856
to allocate space that's not
actually going to be used.


430
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,176
Lock screen grace period.


431
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:55,546
So let's imagine we
set this to one minute.


432
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,346
And this option gives
the schools


433
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,866
to choose the right
balance between ease of use


434
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,416
for their students and data
security for their students.


435
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,866
And I think it's easier to
illustrate with an animation


436
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:06,886
than for me to talk about it.


437
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,376
Again, let's imagine we
set it to one minute.


438
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,566
The teacher asks the students
to put their Shared iPads down.


439
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:15,686
So the screen locks.


440
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,566
Let's imagine she
doesn't have much to say


441
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:20,576
and after 30 seconds Mia
swipes to unlock her device


442
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,686
and she gets right back
to work without having


443
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:23,656
to enter her pass code.


444
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,756
Now let's imagine the
teacher has rather more to say


445
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,056
and Mia swipes after
five minutes.


446
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,006
She will be prompted to
enter her pass code again.


447
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,626
So, again, this offers an
opportunity for schools


448
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,966
to choose that right balance.


449
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,166
Another detail for
you MDM vendors,


450
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:46,856
iOS as part of Shared iPad now
has a user channel in addition


451
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,596
to the device channel
that can be used


452
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,946
to send MDM commands
and install profiles.


453
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,096
macOS has had a user
channel all along, of course.


454
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,376
And this is very similar


455
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,976
but with some differences
I'll cover in a moment.


456
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,076
In fact, if your MDM solution
is already sending commands


457
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,506
over the user channel to Macs,
if they were sending them


458
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,866
to iOS devices previously,
they would have been ignored.


459
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:11,126
But with iOS devices 9.3


460
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,766
and later they will now
pay attention to them.


461
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,976
There's a subset of
configuration profile payloads


462
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,426
which are able to be
used on the user channel


463
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,626
which I'll cover in a moment.


464
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,886
One important difference
between the user channel in iOS


465
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,616
and macOS is that no user
authentication is performed


466
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:33,286
before delivering those per-user
commands to a Shared iPad.


467
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:36,016
So you should never send
sensitive information


468
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:38,446
over user channel, and
in fact, we will enforce


469
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,316
that no credentials are
delivered over the user channel.


470
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,806
That includes the new
Google OAuth account payload


471
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,516
that we introduced in iOS 9.3.


472
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,786
As I mentioned, all
the accounts payloads,


473
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,476
including that new Google OAuth
account payload, are supported


474
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,146
on the user channel, as
are the new notifications,


475
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:59,486
Home screen layout and Safari
auto-fill domains enhancement


476
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,656
to the domains payload that
we introduced in iOS 9.3.


477
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,066
The existing restrictions
payload can also be used


478
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:09,086
on the user channel, including
the new show/hide apps features


479
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,826
that was added in iOS 9.3.


480
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:15,756
One important detail about
restrictions payloads that may


481
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:19,066
at first seem confusing
but in fact is not a change


482
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,436
from how they have
always worked,


483
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,546
if a restriction's payload is
delivered on a device channel


484
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,946
and the user channel, they
will be combined by iOS


485
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,666
to compute an effective
restriction


486
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,636
with the most restrictive
setting winning.


487
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,086
This prevents a student


488
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,986
from installing another
configuration profile


489
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:38,796
without that setting and
freeing him or herself


490
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:39,556
from that restriction.


491
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,446
The reason this isn't really any
different is this is exactly how


492
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,406
multiple profiles have
always worked even


493
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,046
if delivered all
over device channel.


494
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:52,476
And with that, I'd like to
ask David Steinberg to come up


495
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,396
and give you a demo of
Shared iPad and some


496
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,436
of the other education features
we released this spring.


497
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:57,786
David, take it away.


498
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:01,736dle
[ Applause ]


499
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:01,736
[ Applause ]


500
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:02,776
>> Thanks, Todd.


501
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,286
It's great to be here demoing
Shared iPad to all of you.


502
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:10,196
Let's take a look at
what using Shared iPad


503
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,436
between a couple classes
in a school is like.


504
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:17,236
To start we'll look
at the log in screen.


505
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,146
Now, you can see the
school's name's at the top.


506
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,886
We have some recent
users of the iPad below,


507
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:25,576
and then a class list that
the students can choose


508
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:26,576
from to log in.


509
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:30,646
When I want to log into this
device I can choose my class


510
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:33,406
from the list, which is
the class' name and a list


511
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,656
of students to choose from.


512
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:38,386
If this isn't my class, I can
go back to the class list,


513
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,256
select a separate class, again,
we see the class name and a list


514
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:43,496
of students we can choose from.


515
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:48,186
Now, if I'm not in any class
on this device, I can still log


516
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,286
in using any Managed
Apple ID that belongs


517
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:53,486
to the same organization
as this iPad.


518
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:57,186
But to demonstrate Shared
iPad today let's go back


519
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,256
to our recent users.


520
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:02,656
Here we have Ava, a
second-grader, and Liam,


521
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:05,586
a third-grader, who
both used this iPad


522
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,716
in their classes yesterday.


523
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,306
The second grade class
is about to start.


524
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,746
So let's log in as Ava.


525
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,146
Now, when we log in and log


526
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,706
out our video sync
will cut for a second.


527
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:16,416
So I'll show you here.


528
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,816
After she enters
her credentials,


529
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:23,166
they'll authenticate against
the Cloud, authenticate locally


530
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:26,726
on the device, the iPad will
get ready and then will land


531
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,216
on her personalized Home screen


532
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,566
that the school has
selected for her.


533
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,386
Now, while the video catches up,


534
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,966
let's talk about how this
device has been configured.


535
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,946
The school configured
this device specifically


536
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:39,226
for second and third-graders.


537
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,726
They chose the apps
that each student


538
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,696
in those grades would use and
then created Home screen layouts


539
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:45,886
for each of the students


540
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:49,566
that they would see every
time they land on any iPad


541
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,926
within that organization.


542
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,196
So for Ava, as a second-grader,


543
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,186
they've chosen these
apps and this layout.


544
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:59,586
You can see iBooks
and Notes in the dock


545
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:02,596
because those are the most-used
applications by second-graders.


546
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,566
In fact, Ava's been
taking multiple notes


547
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,396
across a variety
of iPads in school.


548
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:11,116
And you can see that all
of her notes have synced


549
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,826
to this iPad from iCloud.


550
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:16,826
Now, we can create more notes on
this iPad and they'll also sync


551
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,336
and be available on other iPads.


552
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,886
Today her class was
learning about WWDC.


553
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,426
Of course, it's a great topic.


554
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:25,606
So let's help her
out by taking note


555
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:26,826
to commemorate this session.


556
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,056
In fact, let's take
a little video.


557
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,276
All right, everybody,
say, "WWDC."


558
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:34,886
>> WWDC.


559
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,526
>> Woo-hoo.


560
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,926
Perfect. Now she'll
remember this forever.


561
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:47,196
Unfortunately, it's time for her
to end the class and log out.


562
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:50,496
Now, when Ava logs out
the device lets her know


563
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:54,316
which applications are saving
data, and any data that needs


564
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:56,966
to be synced afterwards
at the log in screen


565
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,606
or when another user is
logged in is prepared then.


566
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:02,906
So when we land back at
the log in screen or log


567
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:05,896
in as another user, that
data can continue uploading


568
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:06,606
in the background.


569
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,096
For example, if we had been
recording this entire session


570
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,266
up to this point instead
of making a little video,


571
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:15,426
it would be given another
chance now to start uploading.


572
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,596
Now a third grade
class is starting


573
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,506
and Liam is back at this device.


574
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:24,126
So we'll log in as him.


575
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:27,806
Again, after we enter his
credentials they authentic,


576
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,766
the iPad gets ready,
and he will land


577
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,486
or his personalized Home screen.


578
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:35,766
For the third-graders the
school has chosen most


579
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:38,006
of the same application
as for the second-graders.


580
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:40,836
But they've also included a
couple extra applications,


581
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:42,276
including the ones from iWork


582
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,006
because the third-graders
produce multiple presentations


583
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:45,646
throughout the year.


584
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,446
And they've also included
an app like Safari


585
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:50,166
so that the students
can do research


586
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,336
for those presentations.


587
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,436
So if you look at the dock,


588
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:56,666
you'll see that Liam also
has iBooks and Notes,


589
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:58,796
but he now has Maps and Safari


590
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,236
because the third-graders
are studying the geography


591
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:03,296
and history of the great
state of California.


592
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:07,366
Now, Liam needs to put together
some notes in preparation


593
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,626
for a presentation
he'll be giving.


594
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:12,826
And though Ava just used
this same iPad to take notes,


595
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,726
Liam does not see
any of her notes.


596
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,516
In fact, it looks like Liam has
not been taking very many notes.


597
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,536
So let's help him
get started here.


598
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:22,576
We'll create a new note.


599
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,196
And Liam's found
some images online


600
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,566
that he'll be able
to include here.


601
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,246
So let's add one of those now.


602
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:30,746
Oh, beautiful.


603
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,596
California state flag.


604
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,596
That's a great flag and a
great start to some notes.


605
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,926
But unfortunately, class
has come to an end,


606
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:39,306
so Liam needs to log out.


607
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,316
Thankfully, when he logs out,


608
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,526
he knows that his data is being
saved and it will be available


609
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,156
when he gets home and wants to
continue working on his project.


610
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:53,836
Every day throughout the entire
day different students can use


611
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:57,886
the same iPads to work on their
projects, their data's saved


612
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,116
and it's synced and available


613
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:01,306
across multiple devices
throughout their school.


614
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:04,936
For Ava and Liam, that means
being able to continue working


615
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:07,326
on their projects wherever
they want, wherever they go.


616
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:08,126
Thank you.


617
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:08,956
Back to you, Todd.


618
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:13,546
[ Applause ]


619
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,896
>> Thank you very much, David.


620
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:17,596
Just a brief recap.


621
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,996
So David showed how you
can preconfigure classes


622
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:24,406
on Shared iPad's log in screen,
as well as take advantage


623
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,376
of building up a list
of recent users who sign


624
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,286
in with their Managed
Apple ID and pass code.


625
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:33,246
They had actually signed
in using a [inaudible] user


626
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,226
and demonstrated that Ava


627
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,656
and Liam only see
their own user data


628
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,486
in Notes and over other app.


629
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:43,116
And in fact, the school can
choose to show a different set


630
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,736
of apps and Home screen layout


631
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:46,196
for different groups
of students.


632
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:49,596
Well, that concludes our
getting started section.


633
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:51,716
Let's continue with
distribution.


634
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,036
We got a few changes to
talk about this year.


635
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,566
And let's get right to it.


636
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:01,696
So there's a great new feature
tied to Managed Apple IDs


637
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,366
that allows MDM servers


638
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,266
to programmatically link Managed
Apple IDs from an organization


639
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:09,556
to their Volume Purchase
Program account


640
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:13,826
so that no invitation process
is necessary because we know


641
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:17,986
that this account is coming
from that same organization


642
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:19,936
that wants to distribute
apps and books.


643
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,796
This, of course, does
require that the school's DEP


644
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:26,496
or Apple School Manager
token and VPP token come


645
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:27,716
from the same organization.


646
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:31,066
But as I mentioned earlier,
since the customer doesn't need


647
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:33,826
to download any new
tokens after the transition


648
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:35,916
to Apple School Manager,
this should be simpler.


649
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,776
For you MDM vendors,
it is possible


650
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:44,226
that the school has different
tokens from for DEP and VPP


651
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,076
that appear to be from
different organizations.


652
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,116
There is a dedicated error
code for this failure mode.


653
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,286
So you can try to
perform this association


654
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:56,426
and just catch the failure and
be able to notify them that,


655
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:59,166
"Hey, your tokens don't
match, and you'll need to fix


656
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,256
that before we can
give you this feature."


657
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,886
Of course, to give this
feature to customers,


658
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,356
you'll have to adopt
the API for it,


659
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,006
which is already
available in production.


660
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,146
And this is going
to be very important


661
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:11,726
for distributing iBooks
Store books to Shared iPad,


662
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,626
which we'll talk about next.


663
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:18,746
So how can you get iBooks Store
VPP books to a Shared iPad?


664
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:22,976
VPP books can only
be assigned to users


665
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:25,006
and cannot be distributed
to devices.


666
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,086
So the way it will work is


667
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,236
that once you've
assigned the VPP books


668
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:34,766
to your Managed Apple IDs,
each student when signing


669
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,626
into Shared iPad will
then see them appear


670
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:37,706
in their iBook Bookshelf,


671
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:39,796
and they can simply
tap the download button


672
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,426
to get those bits.


673
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:46,396
The good news is that the second
and on to end student who wants


674
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:49,446
to use that book on
that iPad will appear


675
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:52,636
to immediately download because
the bits are already there


676
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:55,626
on the device and are only
stored once to save storage


677
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,796
and bandwidth of
downloading them repeatedly.


678
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:02,516
In contrast, non-iBook
Store books like PDFs


679
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:05,856
or iBooks author documents or
EPUBs can be device assigned


680
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,666
and managed just like
assigning apps to Shared iPad.


681
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:14,386
Finally, a few important
points in some chance we made


682
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:15,566
to how Enterprise apps


683
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,666
with universal provisioning
profiles worked


684
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,326
that were introduced
in iOS 9 but proved


685
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,576
to be somewhat confusing.


686
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:26,196
These universal provisioning
profiles allow a non-App Store


687
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:30,046
app to run even if that
specific device is not defined


688
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,806
on the provisioning profile
accompanying the app.


689
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:37,966
For this to work, it requires
both initial trust by the user


690
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:42,286
of that app signer, as well
as ongoing periodic validation


691
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:45,406
by Apple that that specific
universal provisioning profile


692
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:46,206
remains valid.


693
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:51,946
So, again, when installing one
of these apps by any way other


694
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:54,856
than MDM, the user must
explicitly trust the app signer.


695
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:59,486
However, if the device
is enrolled in MDM,


696
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,906
those apps are implicitly
trusted based on the fact


697
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:05,056
that they trusted
this organization


698
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,126
when enrolling in MDM.


699
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:08,826
However, the second piece


700
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,856
that Apple must consider
this UPP valid for the app


701
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,206
to continue to run requires
that the device be able


702
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:18,736
to be online occasionally to
see the validation server.


703
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:22,906
Even MDM installed apps
also still require this


704
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,056
periodic validation.


705
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,536
But an MDM server can
trigger the device to say,


706
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:29,776
"Go validate all of
these apps right now."


707
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,666
This is a really key
feature for deployments


708
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,386
such as an electronic flight
bag for an airline pilot


709
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,946
that will be offline
for some period of time


710
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:38,976
on a regular schedule.


711
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:41,966
The MDM server can tell the
device before it's going


712
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,776
to be offline, "Go ahead and
validate all your apps to ensure


713
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:45,846
that they continue to run."


714
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:49,736
And in fact, for
you MDM vendors,


715
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,456
and this is what we've done in
Profile Manager, we recommend


716
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,266
that you just go ahead


717
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,006
and automatically validate
any applications that you see


718
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:59,296
when fetching the
application list at a sync


719
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:03,146
that are not validated, and that
will keep them all running all


720
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:03,496
the time.


721
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:08,246
That concludes our
section on distribution.


722
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:10,456
And now let's move
on to all the changes


723
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,616
in device management
capabilities that are used


724
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,116
in an ongoing basis to
manage your devices remotely.


725
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,036
And to take us through
this section I'd


726
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:19,726
like to invite Shubham Kedia
up here to walk you through it.


727
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:20,386
Shubham?


728
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:24,166
[ Applause ]


729
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,366
>> Thanks, Todd.


730
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,136
Good morning, everyone.


731
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,076
I'm thrilled to be
here to walk you all


732
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,585
through some great new
management features we've added


733
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,616
to both iOS and macOS this year.


734
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:38,315
So let's start with iOS 9.3


735
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,656
where we added some brand
new MDM commands and queries


736
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,166
to go alongside Shared iPad.


737
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:49,146
The settings command was
updated with the ability


738
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:51,545
to now specify the
maximum number of users


739
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,436
that can have local
accounts on an iPad.


740
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:56,156
We saw Todd talk
about this earlier.


741
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:01,756
You can now also toggle
diagnostic submission via MDM.


742
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:05,996
We added some commands that
are specific to user manager


743
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:09,446
as well, such as the user list
command, which you can use


744
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:12,616
to get the list of all users
that have accounts on an iPad


745
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,546
and even get information
like whether


746
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,046
or not they're logged
in, whether


747
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:18,366
or not they have data that's
left to be synced to the Cloud,


748
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,096
as well as information
about their user quota


749
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,686
and how much space they've used.


750
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,986
There are new commands
to log out users


751
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:27,536
and delete users as well.


752
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:33,936
9.3 also introduced MDM Lost
Mode and MDM Activation Lock.


753
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,186
Now, these aren't
specific to Shared iPad;


754
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,646
these work across all
supervised devices.


755
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,816
So you can rest assured that
if a device gets misplaced,


756
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:46,326
you can remotely enable MDM
Lost Mode with a custom message


757
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:48,126
and phone number
and even be able


758
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,406
to get the device's location.


759
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,976
For devices like Shared iPads


760
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,286
where you don't have an Apple
ID associated with them,


761
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,806
MDM Activation Lock is also a
great option to prevent theft.


762
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,516
Now, before I move
on I'd like to point


763
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,386
out these icons that
you see here.


764
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:07,566
These represent commands,
queries,


765
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,486
or configuration
profiles that are specific


766
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,736
to either Shared
iPad or supervised


767
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,246
that you'll see throughout
the slides.


768
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:19,476
9.3 also introduced some
great configuration profiles


769
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:22,766
that you allow to configure
your devices exactly the way


770
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,246
you want.


771
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,386
The education payload is used


772
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,746
to configure both the
Shared iPad log in screen


773
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:30,046
as well as Classroom app.


774
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,306
Notifications allows you


775
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:34,546
to configure exactly the
notifications settings you'd


776
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:36,456
like for all applications.


777
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,746
You can preapprove or deny
notification from apps


778
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:42,976
that aren't even installed
yet and even toggle things


779
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,406
like sounds and badges.


780
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,336
The Home screen layout
payload that we saw David use


781
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,526
in his demo earlier can be used


782
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:52,656
to configure exactly
the arrangement of apps


783
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:55,676
and folders you'd like
your students to use.


784
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,626
The lock screen message
payload allows you


785
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:02,406
to specify a custom
footnote that appears both


786
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:05,666
on the lock screen and the
log in screen of Shared iPad.


787
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,906
The exchange and mail payloads
saw some updates as well.


788
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:14,976
You can now choose whether
you want to allow the use


789
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:18,416
of Mail Drop when sending
emails from those accounts.


790
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:23,066
The domains payload has been
updated with the ability


791
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,286
to now specify exactly
the domains


792
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,806
for which Safari will offer to
save and auto fill passwords.


793
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:31,316
For you Enterprise
folks out there,


794
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,356
we've updated the
VPN payload as well


795
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,676
with some great new
IKEv2 settings,


796
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,816
and the restrictions payload
has in number of new keys.


797
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:43,326
You can now restrict
things like Apple Music,


798
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:46,246
iCloud Photo Library,
and iTunes Radio.


799
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,086
You can also choose whether
or not you want students


800
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:55,376
to be monitored by teachers
when using Classroom app.


801
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:59,166
You can disable modification
of notification settings,


802
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,606
which you may have set using
the notifications payload,


803
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:05,636
as well as -- and you also
have the ability to now show


804
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:06,896
and hide specific apps.


805
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:09,826
Again, we saw David use
this in his demo earlier.


806
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:14,816
I'd like to talk a
little bit more in depth


807
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:16,016
about the education payload.


808
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:19,226
It's extremely important
that you adopt this


809
00:38:19,226 --> 00:38:22,406
because not only does it
configure which students


810
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:25,616
and classes you see in the
log in screen of Shared iPad,


811
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:28,816
but it's also how Classroom
app determines how teacher


812
00:38:28,816 --> 00:38:31,046
and student devices should
connect with each other.


813
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:35,866
In this payload you'll specify
students, teachers, and classes,


814
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,106
and even be able
to specify photos


815
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:39,976
for these students and teachers.


816
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:43,316
You'll do so by specifying URLs.


817
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:48,626
And it's important that
these URLs are over HTTPS.


818
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:53,226
When you update these photos,
you should also update the URLs.


819
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:57,676
Only one such payload can
be installed per device,


820
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,996
and it's important
to note that student


821
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,466
and teacher devices
require different payloads.


822
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:08,096
So all these payloads that I've
talked about can, of course,


823
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,406
be applied at the device
level so they apply to all


824
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,976
of the users on a Shared iPad.


825
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,666
But there are five
payloads that we support


826
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,656
over the user channel per user.


827
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,656
These include all of
the accounts payloads,


828
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:23,106
including the new Google
OAuth account, notifications,


829
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:26,486
Home screen layout, the domains
payload with the new support


830
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:30,096
for Safari auto fill domains, as
well as the restrictions payload


831
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,226
with the ability to
show and hide apps.


832
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:37,076
Next let's talk about iOS 9.3.2.


833
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,706
Here we updated the settings
command to allow to you enable


834
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,156
or disable app analytics,


835
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:45,406
as well as set the lock
screen grace period.


836
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,946
Of course, we also updated
the DeviceInformation


837
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:50,586
and SecurityInfo queries


838
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,866
to return the correct
state from the device.


839
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:55,466
One thing to note here is


840
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,446
that the security info query
will actually return pass code


841
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:02,016
lock grace period and pass code
lock grace period enforced.


842
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:06,286
The enforced value might be more
restrictive than what you've set


843
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:10,346
from your MDM server since it
can't be made less restrictive


844
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,666
while users are logged in.


845
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:18,886
Now, one of the great uses
for iPads in a classroom is


846
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:19,976
for standardized testing.


847
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,216
And we've had two great
solutions for this


848
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,636
in past releases:
Single App mode


849
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,186
and Autonomous Single App mode.


850
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,876
These continue to work the
same as they have before


851
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,006
on supervised devices.


852
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:35,436
However, now with a new
entitlement that you can add


853
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,476
to your app, you
can use the same API


854
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:42,186
and also disable five system
features that make sense


855
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:43,286
for your assessment app.


856
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:47,276
These include things like
auto correct, Define,


857
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:50,946
keyboard shortcuts, predictive
keyboard, and spell check.


858
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:55,266
And for the first time the
entitlement also grants you the


859
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:59,346
ability to enable this mode on
unmanaged, unsupervised devices.


860
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:03,356
Of course, we do
have a safe escape


861
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:04,936
on unmanaged unsupervised
devices


862
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:10,626
where you can simply reboot
the device and exit this mode.


863
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:13,616
9.3.2 also added a
new restrictions key


864
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,576
to prevent users from disabling


865
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,356
or enabling diagnostic
submission,


866
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,736
which you may have set via MDM.


867
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:24,396
Now let's talk about iOS 10.


868
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:29,826
In iOS 10 we updated the
contacts, exchange, Google,


869
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:32,286
and the LDAP payloads
to include a new key


870
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,116
for communication service rules.


871
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:40,236
We saw earlier this week the
new VoIP extension support


872
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:40,826
in iOS 10.


873
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:41,956
And what this key allows you


874
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:45,176
to do is specify a default
application to be used


875
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:48,826
when making audio calls to
contacts from these accounts.


876
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:52,926
The lock screen message
payload has been updated


877
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:54,126
with new key names as well.


878
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,756
Of course, it remains
completely transparent


879
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,786
for administers creating
such payloads,


880
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:02,646
but we like MDM vendors to
adopt these new key names


881
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:04,246
as the old ones have
been deprecated.


882
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:10,456
The VPN payload now has support
for EAP-only authentication


883
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,566
for IKEv2, as well
as the ability


884
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,976
to specify a timeout for IPSec.


885
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:20,636
PPTP has also been removed
from iOS 10 and macOS Sierra,


886
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,496
and existing payloads
will not work.


887
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:26,866
The Wi-Fi payload saw
some updates as well.


888
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:32,086
You can specify if you want to
bypass captive network detection


889
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:35,726
and Cisco fast lane
quality of service marking.


890
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:38,856
And for those of you who know
what it is, it's fantastic.


891
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,116
Finally, the restrictions
payload now has a key


892
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:46,006
to prevent users from
toggling Bluetooth.


893
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,676
Now, this is extremely
important in the Classroom case


894
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:50,676
since Classroom relies
on Bluetooth


895
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,156
to connect its student
and teacher devices.


896
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:58,406
So here are some restrictions


897
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,316
that were introduced before
supervision was created.


898
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:05,306
And we talked last year about
how in a future iOS release we'd


899
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:09,176
like to deprecate these and
these would stop being enforced


900
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:10,606
on unsupervised devices.


901
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,936
Now, that future iOS
release is not iOS 10,


902
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:18,126
but we promise we are going
to get rid of them very soon.


903
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:21,196
So please note that these
will stop being enforced


904
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:26,916
on unsupervised devices.


905
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,816
Next let's talk about macOS.


906
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:31,996
Earlier this year we
introduced the ability


907
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,996
to install software updates
from major OS releases


908
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:37,606
on Macs enrolled in the
Device Enrollment Program.


909
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,166
This is going to be
great come this fall


910
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:43,256
when macOS Sierra is
released where you'll be able


911
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:46,306
to install it on
all Macs enrolled


912
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:49,636
in Device Enrollment Program in
your education or Enterprise.


913
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,546
New in macOS Sierra we also
introduced a new configuration


914
00:43:56,546 --> 00:44:00,336
profile payload to
configure the IP firewall


915
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:03,146
and added some new updates
to the restrictions payload.


916
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:07,006
We brought some keys
back to the Mac from iOS,


917
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:09,926
such as Apple Music,
iCloud Keychain


918
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:13,446
and iCloud Photo Library,
as well as added some


919
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:16,296
that are specific to the
Mac, such as Back to My Mac,


920
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:19,926
Find My Mac, and sharing to
Notes, Reminders, or LinkedIn.


921
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:24,796
It's been my pleasure
to walk you through some


922
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,746
of these great features
we've added this year.


923
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,906
And with that, I'd like
to turn it back to Todd.


924
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:29,846
Thank you.


925
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:32,091
[ Applause ]


926
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:32,526
>> Great job.


927
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,826
Thanks. All right.


928
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:36,886
Thank you very much, Shubham.


929
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:39,656
Let's turn to our final
section today on tools.


930
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:43,246
And of course, the most exciting
new tool this year is Classroom.


931
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,676
We talked a little
bit about it earlier


932
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:48,916
and it offers some amazing
new features, that small,


933
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,546
carefully curated
set of features


934
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:53,606
for teachers in the classroom.


935
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:55,546
But instead of hearing
me talk about them,


936
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,486
you can read the
list on the slide.


937
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:00,896
I'd like to ask Shruti Gupta to
come on up and give you a demo.


938
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:01,886
Shruti?


939
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:07,576
[ Applause ]


940
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:08,636
>> Thanks, Todd.


941
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:15,056
I am so excited to show you one
of our coolest apps, Classroom.


942
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:17,486
What you see here
is a teacher iPad


943
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:18,756
that is running Classroom on it.


944
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,716
And there are a bunch
of student iPads


945
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:22,596
that are configure
as Shared iPad.


946
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,446
And all my students are
sitting right here in front row.


947
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:30,196
When the class begins, the
teacher assigns students


948
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:33,556
to the iPads and then students
log in with their pass code.


949
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:36,766
For this demo the students are
already assigned and logged


950
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:38,416
in since you've already
seen the log


951
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,856
in process during David's demo.


952
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,406
Now, let's assume that I'm
the teacher of the class


953
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,886
and today we'll be learning
about healthy eating.


954
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:48,896
And for that I found a really
great article that I want


955
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:49,986
to share with all my students.


956
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:54,866
So I'm going to tap on
Navigate, Safari, Favorites,


957
00:45:55,076 --> 00:45:56,856
and select the healthy
eating article.


958
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:05,496
And it's navigating;
it's opening the URL


959
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,796
on all student devices.


960
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:13,536
Okay. Looks like one
student is offline right now.


961
00:46:13,756 --> 00:46:15,776
But if you look at
the Classroom app,


962
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:19,436
you can see that Classroom app
created a dynamic group called


963
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:22,756
Safari, indicating that all
students are now using Safari,


964
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:22,986
yeah?


965
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:27,326
And if you tap on the screens,
we can see that article open


966
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,326
up pretty much on
all student iPads.


967
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:34,516
And I guess some are already
trying to do something else.


968
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,556
Kids, pay attention
to the class.


969
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:42,266
[ Laughter ]


970
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,306
>> So for the next
activity let's say I want


971
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:45,916
to divide the students
into smaller group.


972
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,326
So I'm going to tap on Class
button to create a group,


973
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:52,376
add a bunch of students
by tapping on their names,


974
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:56,596
and give the group a
name, let's say Greens.


975
00:46:57,066 --> 00:47:01,586
Now when I launch
this particular group


976
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,426
into activities specific
for them,


977
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,376
let's say I want Green's group


978
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,586
to make a list of
green vegetables.


979
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:10,146
I will open Notes app for them


980
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,496
so they can start
working on their activity.


981
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:21,956
Okay? And while students
are working or their task,


982
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:23,056
I want to see how they're doing.


983
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:25,506
So I'm going to go back
to all student group


984
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:27,376
and observe their screen.


985
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:32,296
And it seems that Edison is not
paying attention in the class.


986
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:33,956
Let's take a closer look.


987
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,486
I'm going to tap on
Edison, tap on View Screen,


988
00:47:38,076 --> 00:47:40,516
and clearly she is not
working on her assignment.


989
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,346
So I'm going to go back.


990
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:47,246
Now I can either lock her screen
by tapping on the Lock button


991
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:52,146
to get her attention back in the
class, or I can lock her iPad


992
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:57,146
into Notes app by sliding
the Lock button and tapping


993
00:47:57,146 --> 00:48:00,366
on the Notes so she
remains focused on her task.


994
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:06,476
Once the class ends, I can bring
an end to the class by logging


995
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:09,626
out all the students iPads
by tap on the Log Out button.


996
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:14,736
And all the students
are now logging out.


997
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:15,546
Thank you.


998
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:16,396
Back to Todd.


999
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:17,406
>> Thank you very much, Shruti.


1000
00:48:17,406 --> 00:48:19,016
It was great of you
to all cooperate


1001
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:21,376
in this amazing stress
test of Classroom


1002
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,906
with the most iOS devices
it's ever seen before.


1003
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:25,196
Thank you very much.


1004
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,016
So what did we see?


1005
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,386
We saw Shruti use
Classroom to open an app


1006
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:33,516
on all the student iPads,
create and edit manual groups


1007
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:34,946
in addition to the
dynamic groups


1008
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:38,406
that Classroom creates
automatically, lock a student


1009
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,746
into an app to focus
their attention,


1010
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:44,926
view the students' screens to
monitor what they're working on


1011
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:48,056
and redirect as needed,
including locking their device


1012
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:48,966
if they get off track.


1013
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:53,416
So a few brief notes
about some other tools


1014
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:56,546
that we make available to
MDM vendors, some simulators


1015
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:58,076
for the Device Enrollment
Program


1016
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,356
and Volume Purchase Program,
which are a great way for them


1017
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,466
to test their implementation of
the API's for those services,


1018
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:06,726
especially handling
service errors


1019
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:08,626
that may be very
difficult or impossible


1020
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:11,736
to simulate any other way with
the real production service.


1021
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,456
The simulators have been
updated to support all


1022
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:16,896
of the new features
we've talked about.


1023
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:19,246
And as always, they're
available for download


1024
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:20,216
on the Developer portal.


1025
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,776
And I strongly encourage you to
download and make use of them.


1026
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:26,736
That brings us to the
end of our content.


1027
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,296
Just a few summary slides


1028
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:32,276
to cover the key points
for administrators.


1029
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:35,756
If you're a school
administrator, sign up for


1030
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,476
and use Apple School Manager
to manage the people, devices,


1031
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,766
and content in your school.


1032
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,586
Everyone can use the DEP
program for wirelessly enrolling


1033
00:49:45,586 --> 00:49:47,746
in their remote management
system of choice,


1034
00:49:48,206 --> 00:49:51,766
or you can also use
Configurator to enroll in MDM


1035
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:54,986
or to combine the two using
Configurator's automated


1036
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:59,876
enrollment feature that
allows you to connect devices


1037
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,916
to Configurator and complete
the setup assistant based


1038
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,856
on the DEP settings without
having to touch each device.


1039
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:10,026
If you're a school and
doing shared deployment,


1040
00:50:10,026 --> 00:50:13,276
use Shared iPad with Managed
Apple ID on those devices


1041
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,446
and everyone can use VPP managed
distribution to distribute apps


1042
00:50:17,446 --> 00:50:20,146
to devices or users
depending on whether you want


1043
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:23,036
to allow your users to use
those apps on multiple devices.


1044
00:50:24,406 --> 00:50:27,956
For MDM developers, please add
support for the new features,


1045
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:32,546
including the programmatic
association of Managed Apple IDs


1046
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:35,826
for use with VPP, as well
as all the new features


1047
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,786
that Shubham talked
about that are new


1048
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,706
in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.


1049
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:42,776
Updated documentation
was released yesterday.


1050
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:47,836
And please, again, do test with
the DEP and VPP simulators.


1051
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:51,116
Last but not least,
you app developers,


1052
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:54,226
we want you to get your
app's education ready


1053
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,236
by storing your app's data
and preferences in the Cloud.


1054
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,686
And you can simulate
testing on a Shared iPad


1055
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:04,066
by testing using your app
moving between two iPads.


1056
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:06,626
And the session immediately
following lunch


1057
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:09,436
about best practices will
go into much more detail


1058
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:12,796
about what you need to do
and how you can test it.


1059
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,236
Speaking of which, this is the
session I was just referring to.


1060
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:18,956
Again, right here
in a couple hours.


1061
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,806
There's some great
resources we make available


1062
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:26,556
on our website both for
education at Apple.com/education


1063
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:30,776
and for Enterprise at
developer.Apple.com/Enterprise.


1064
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:32,106
I encourage you to check it out.


1065
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:35,576
And finally, there are
some additional resources,


1066
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:38,126
direct links to documentations,
and other resources


1067
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:42,226
at our WWDC 2016
session-specific URL


1068
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:43,496
for Session 303.


1069
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,396
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention


1070
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,726
and hope you have a
great rest of WWDC.


1071
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:49,756
Thank you very much.
