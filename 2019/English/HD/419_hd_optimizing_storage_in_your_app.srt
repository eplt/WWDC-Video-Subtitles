3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,866
>> Hi, I'm Kai Kaahaaina and


4
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:19,976
today along with Alejandro


5
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,316
Lucena we'll be discussing how


6
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:23,316
to optimize storage for your


7
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:23,956
app.


8
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,126
Just like CPU memory, storage is


9
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,216
a finite resource.


10
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:30,756
When an app makes optimal use of


11
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,436
storage, we can help better


12
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:35,316
ensure long battery life,


13
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:37,526
better performance,


14
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:40,486
reduced app footprint,


15
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:43,246
and good device health.


16
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:46,786
Our main optimization topics


17
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,386
today will be efficient image


18
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:50,756
assets, syncing to disk,


19
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,316
serialized data files, Core


20
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,696
Data, and SQLite.


21
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,196
First up, efficient image


22
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:00,666
assets.


23
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,156
As screen sizes have gotten


24
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:02,946
larger there's been a


25
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:04,336
corresponding increase in the


26
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,556
size of image assets.


27
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,246
For our session we've created a


28
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,966
very simple demo app for


29
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,646
cataloging and favoriting


30
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:14,366
photos.


31
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:16,606
However, even when preloaded


32
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,116
with just a few photos, our app


33
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,736
has already grown to 24.6


34
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:20,726
megabytes in size.


35
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:23,176
We'll now talk about two ways we


36
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:25,846
can reduce the size of our app.


37
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,566
The first is HEIC.


38
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,826
HEIC, also referred to as HEIF


39
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,746
sometimes, is a more efficient


40
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:36,356
and capable alternative to JPEG.


41
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,226
HEIC offers 50 percent smaller


42
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,156
files at comparable quality to


43
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,926
JPEG which of course means a


44
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,316
smaller on disk footprint, and


45
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,636
smaller files could be more


46
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:48,466
easily moved up and down the


47
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:49,086
network.


48
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,096
They can also be more quickly


49
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:55,526
loaded and saved to disk.


50
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,066
HEIC also offers many features


51
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,516
not available in JPEG such as


52
00:01:58,516 --> 00:01:59,626
the ability to store auxiliary


53
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,316
images that contain depth and


54
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:02,236
disparity information.


55
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:06,056
HEIC also supports alpha and


56
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:07,026
lossless compression.


57
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:10,346
HEIC even allows you to store


58
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,496
multiple images in a single


59
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:12,906
container.


60
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,376
iOS has supported HEIC since iOS


61
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,266
11 and macOS has supported HEIC


62
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,456
since macOS High Sierra.


63
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,396
It's also available in other


64
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:22,946
operating systems.


65
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,066
So going back to our demo app we


66
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,606
start off using JPEG assets and


67
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,786
had an on disk footprint of 24.6


68
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,346
megabytes.


69
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,596
By simply adopting HEIC instead


70
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:36,896
of JPEG, we were able to reduce


71
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,736
the size of this app to 17.9


72
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:39,296
megabytes.


73
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,576
That's a 27 percent reduction


74
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,506
simply by adopting HEIC.


75
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,566
The other way we can reduce the


76
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,966
footprint of our app is by using


77
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:49,896
Asset Catalogs.


78
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:52,086
Asset Catalogs are a great way


79
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,116
of organizing the assets for


80
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,246
your app.


81
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,246
Assets such as the app icon and


82
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,886
device and scale variants to


83
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:00,456
your images.


84
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,446
Asset Catalogs provide a very


85
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:03,786
easy way of storing multiple


86
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:05,236
resolutions of the same image


87
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,086
which makes it very easy to


88
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,386
support a wide variety of


89
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:08,936
devices.


90
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,446
We also can use Asset Catalogs


91
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:14,946
to tag on demand resources so


92
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:15,996
the user doesn't need to see


93
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,586
them downloaded until they're


94
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:18,896
ready to use them.


95
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:22,646
We get both storage and


96
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:23,776
performance benefits through the


97
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,006
use of Asset Catalogs.


98
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:28,316
We first get to reduce our on


99
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,566
disk footprint because Asset


100
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,036
Catalogs store all of our image


101
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,466
assets in a single optimized


102
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,946
format instead of individual


103
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,456
files.


104
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:38,106
And the App Store also uses


105
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,726
metadata from your Asset Catalog


106
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,026
to help support app slicing for


107
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:41,836
your iOS apps.


108
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:44,236
This way when a customer


109
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:45,046
downloads your app from the


110
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,866
store, they get only the assets


111
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:47,966
they need for their particular


112
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:48,386
device.


113
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,056
This makes the download smaller


114
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,516
and the user has to wait less


115
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,056
time for the app to download and


116
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:54,106
they can start enjoying your app


117
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:54,816
much sooner.


118
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,536
We also get performance wins.


119
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,966
Again, owing to the optimized


120
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,576
format that Asset Catalogs saves


121
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,746
our image assets in, images can


122
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:05,586
be loaded more quickly.


123
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,306
This is especially beneficial


124
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:08,636
for app launch time.


125
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,896
Particularly on Macs with hard


126
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:11,856
drives where we've seen up to a


127
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,886
10 percent improvement on app


128
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:14,686
launch performance.


129
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:18,926
Asset Catalogs also make it


130
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,805
really easy to adopt GPU-based


131
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:21,276
compression.


132
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,406
This compression is lossless by


133
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:26,516
default, but lossy image options


134
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:27,376
are available.


135
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:31,266
All enjoy hardware accelerated


136
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,896
decompression, and one option


137
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,716
even provides a way of lowering


138
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,496
the in-memory footprint of your


139
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:37,976
image assets.


140
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,116
So going back to our demo app,


141
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,126
earlier we saw we were able to


142
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:45,256
reduce the size of the app to


143
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,526
17.9 megabytes by adopting HEIC.


144
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:50,396
Now, by having also adopted


145
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:52,376
Asset Catalogs, primarily though


146
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,896
the app slicing feature, we're


147
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:54,936
able to further reduce the


148
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,786
footprint of this app to 14.9


149
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:57,236
megabytes.


150
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,956
That's a 40 percent reduction in


151
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:00,976
footprint since we started


152
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:02,796
simply by adopting HEIC and


153
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:03,666
Asset Catalogs.


154
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,126
So if you aren't already using


155
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,356
HEIC for your image assets and


156
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:09,776
Asset Catalogs to help organize


157
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,276
your assets, we highly recommend


158
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:11,986
looking into using them.


159
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,146
They're a great and easy way of


160
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,496
getting a more efficient and


161
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:15,456
smaller app footprint.


162
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,816
Next up I'd like to talk a


163
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,006
little about file system


164
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:25,496
metadata.


165
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,946
Our demo app maintains a small


166
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,366
plist that just keeps track of


167
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,076
the last time the app was


168
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:29,606
launched.


169
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,546
Each time the app is launched,


170
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:33,506
we read in this plist, update


171
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,496
the last app launch time


172
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,036
property, and write the updated


173
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,346
plist back out to disk.


174
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:40,576
If we observe what this behavior


175
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:41,726
looks like using the File


176
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,996
Activity instrument Alejandro


177
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:43,766
will be discussing a little bit


178
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,606
later in the talk, we can see


179
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:46,756
that this behavior causes one


180
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,316
read which makes a lot of sense,


181
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,806
we read the plist in, but it


182
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,286
causes three write operations


183
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,556
which might be a bit surprising


184
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:54,836
since we're only writing out one


185
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:55,246
file.


186
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,316
We also see an fsync operation


187
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,876
and these can be expensive and


188
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:00,906
we'll talk a little bit more


189
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:01,966
about why that can be expensive


190
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,436
a bit later.


191
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,216
So why three writes instead of


192
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:06,516
one?


193
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,596
Well the answer is file system


194
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:09,046
metadata.


195
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,606
File system metadata is data


196
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,686
that the file system needs to


197
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,956
update every time we create a


198
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:15,996
file or delete a file.


199
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,386
So in this case, our writing a


200
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,206
plist, creating a file, causes


201
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,546
extra overhead.


202
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,116
So what is file system metadata?


203
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,706
File system metadata is the


204
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:27,776
information the file system


205
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,436
needs to track about our files.


206
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,016
Things such as the file name,


207
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:36,356
size, location, and dates like


208
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,086
date created or last modified.


209
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:39,716
And a lot more.


210
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:42,936
To get a better understanding of


211
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,126
what the file system has to do


212
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,186
every time we create a file,


213
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,406
let's walk through what APFS has


214
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:48,686
to do when we go to write our


215
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,016
NSDictionary file to disk.


216
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:52,726
Well the first thing that APFS


217
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,906
is going to do is update the


218
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,506
file system tree and it's going


219
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,556
to do this by updating one of


220
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:58,106
its nodes.


221
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,966
However, owing to the copy on


222
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,186
write nature of APFS we don't


223
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,216
actually update an existing


224
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,456
node, we create a copy of an


225
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:07,036
existing node.


226
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,496
Let's look at this in detail.


227
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:10,756
So here's our existing file


228
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,336
system tree.


229
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,366
And we see a copy made of an


230
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,766
existing node.


231
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,516
How this new node differs from


232
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,546
the original isn't in the node


233
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:21,786
name, it's actually the same as


234
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,396
the original node, but the new


235
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,686
node has an incremented or at


236
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,166
least different transaction ID.


237
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,506
And it's this different


238
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:28,856
transaction ID that allows APFS


239
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,786
to support advanced features


240
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:33,406
such as snapshots.


241
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,986
So going back up a level, now


242
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:37,086
that we have our updated file


243
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,926
system tree, APFS needs to


244
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,686
update the object map so it's


245
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:41,486
aware of the new node.


246
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,036
So in total, to support writing


247
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,966
this new file, APFS had to do


248
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,226
two separate operations that


249
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:52,166
totaled 8K of write I/O, 4K to


250
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,356
update the file system tree,


251
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,876
another 4K to update the object


252
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,066
map.


253
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,556
And we still need to write the


254
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:00,746
file itself which, in this case


255
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,096
even though it's only 240 bytes


256
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:04,196
of NSDictionary data, the


257
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:05,426
smallest file we can write to


258
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,966
disk on an iOS device is 4K so


259
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,346
it gets rounded up.


260
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,496
So in total we had to write 12K


261
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,516
of data to disk to store a 240


262
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:15,816
byte NSDictionary.


263
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:18,036
That's about 2 percent


264
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:18,546
efficiency.


265
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:20,496
So not only does the example


266
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:21,886
show us the work that APFS needs


267
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,576
to do to track file creation, it


268
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,166
also highlights how expensive it


269
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,846
can be to store small amounts of


270
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:28,696
data in individual files on the


271
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:29,746
file system.


272
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,416
So in the example we just walked


273
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,326
through we saw that we had to do


274
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,706
8K of I/O to support creating a


275
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,456
file on APFS.


276
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:41,496
Well what about deleting a file?


277
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:42,256
That's 8K.


278
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,135
Other common operations such as


279
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,156
renaming a file is 16K.


280
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,296
Modifying an existing file is


281
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:50,136
8K.


282
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,286
The big take away from this is


283
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:54,936
that file system updates aren't


284
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:55,116
free.


285
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,786
In fact, they can involve more


286
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,266
I/O usage than the data being


287
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:58,616
stored.


288
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:00,656
So as a result, we need to be


289
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:01,626
selective about how we create


290
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,076
and modify and delete files.


291
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,026
We want to try to avoid


292
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,266
expensive behaviors such as


293
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:07,816
rapidly creating and deleting


294
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:07,976
files.


295
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:12,946
If we have a use case where we


296
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,196
do need to keep temporary data


297
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,596
on the file system, here's a


298
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,586
great way of trying to reduce


299
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,096
the cost to the system for that


300
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:18,756
temporary data.


301
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:22,036
First, create your file but keep


302
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,546
it open and unlinked, and do not


303
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:26,316
call fsync on it.


304
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:27,896
Doing this will give the file


305
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,086
system the hints it needs to


306
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,446
keep the temporary file in the


307
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,206
OS cache as long as possible and


308
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,566
not write out to disk as


309
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:37,056
frequently as it might have to.


310
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:37,986
If you'd like to learn more


311
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:39,306
about file system metadata in


312
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:41,086
APFS we have a great reference


313
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,026
document on our developer


314
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,356
website and I highly recommend


315
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:48,386
checking it out.


316
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,246
Next up, syncing to disk.


317
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:53,856
When it comes to managing where


318
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,406
our data lives, we want to keep


319
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:57,156
our data in the cache closest to


320
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,786
the CPU for best performance,


321
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,306
but we also want to ensure that


322
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:04,176
our data gets to disk when we


323
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:04,606
need it to.


324
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,596
First let's talk about the


325
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:07,766
various caches that we have.


326
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,616
First there's the OS cache.


327
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:11,936
This is where we want to keep


328
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,386
our data for best performance.


329
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,106
Reads and writes to the OS cache


330
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,416
are referred to as logical I/O.


331
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,356
As this cache is backed by


332
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:21,326
memory, logical I/O operations


333
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:22,486
complete very quickly.


334
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,696
Keeping data in the OS cache is


335
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:25,746
often advantageous for


336
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,406
frequently used and modified


337
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:27,686
data.


338
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:31,826
Next, we have the disk cache and


339
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:32,616
the disk cache is actually


340
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,926
physically located on the


341
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:34,686
storage device.


342
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:37,916
And lastly, we have permanent


343
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,386
storage.


344
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:39,496
This is the actual physical


345
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:40,666
medium which will be persisting


346
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,876
the data long term.


347
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:43,776
In the case of iOS devices and


348
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:48,006
most Macs, this is NAND.


349
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,346
Physical I/Os are reads and


350
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:50,826
writes to and from the physical


351
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:51,286
storage.


352
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,876
These I/Os may be to the or from


353
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,356
the disk cache or the permanent


354
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:56,736
storage.


355
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:59,196
So now that we have talked a


356
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,086
little about the caches and


357
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,516
permanent storage, let's talk


358
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,856
about the most common APIs we


359
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:05,196
use to move data from the OS


360
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,826
cache to the storage device.


361
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,856
First up is fsync.


362
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:12,076
fsync causes data to be moved


363
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,426
from the OS cache to the disk


364
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:14,716
cache.


365
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:17,626
It doesn't however guarantee


366
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,236
that the data will be written to


367
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:20,366
permanent storage immediately.


368
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:21,916
Without further input from


369
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,636
software, it's up to the


370
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,896
device's firmware to determine


371
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,856
when data gets moved from the


372
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,146
disk cache to permanent storage.


373
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,886
It also doesn't guarantee write


374
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:30,266
ordering.


375
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:32,276
That's to say, the order in


376
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,726
which data's written from the OS


377
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,086
cache to the disk cache may not


378
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:36,346
necessarily be the same order in


379
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,566
which data is written from the


380
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,226
disk cache to permanent storage.


381
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,546
fsync can also be expensive if


382
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:43,426
it's overused.


383
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,236
When we had our data in the OS


384
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,716
cache, the OS cache was able to


385
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,646
easily absorb overwrites or


386
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:50,946
modifications to the same data.


387
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:52,766
Once we used fsync it got moved


388
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:53,416
to the disk cache.


389
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,816
And depending on the cadence in


390
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,806
which we need to ensure our data


391
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:57,826
gets moved to the disk cache,


392
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,966
calling fsync manually may not


393
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,196
even be necessary as it's done


394
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,646
periodically for us by the OS.


395
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,806
The primary way data gets moved


396
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:11,696
all the way from the OS cache to


397
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:12,676
permanent storage is through the


398
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:14,516
use of F controls, FFULLFSYNC.


399
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:16,886
This causes the data in the


400
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:18,276
drive's disk cache to get


401
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:18,586
flushed.


402
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,366
However this causes all of the


403
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,466
data in the disk cache to get


404
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,406
flushed so not only is the data


405
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:25,616
that we were interested in


406
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:26,696
moving all the way to permanent


407
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,866
storage get moved to permanent


408
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,666
storage, all the data in the


409
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,426
disk cache does.


410
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,756
As a result, it's expensive


411
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:34,956
because this could be a lot of


412
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,116
data and it could take a lot of


413
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:36,376
time.


414
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,166
And again, it might actually not


415
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,106
even be necessary to do this


416
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,686
manually as this is done


417
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,696
periodically for us by the OS.


418
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,406
If the primary reason we were


419
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:49,966
using FFULLFSYNC was to ensure


420
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,646
I/O ordering, a great and much


421
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,706
more efficient alternative is


422
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,966
using F BARRIERFSYNC.


423
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,966
F BARRIERFSYNC enforces I/O


424
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:57,316
ordering.


425
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,346
F BARRIERFSYNC is probably best


426
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,546
thought of as being basically an


427
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,186
fsync with a barrier and the


428
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:04,986
barrier is a hint to the Apple


429
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,786
SSD to execute all the iOS that


430
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,526
were received before the barrier


431
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,846
before executing any of the iOS


432
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,266
which were received after the


433
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:12,696
barrier.


434
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:15,496
As a result, it's a lot less


435
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,696
expensive than F FULLFSYNC as we


436
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,976
get the same result we wanted


437
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,536
without having to push all the


438
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,176
data in the disk cache to


439
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:22,926
permanent storage.


440
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,836
So if you're concerned about I/O


441
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:26,966
ordering, please use F


442
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,296
BARRIERFSYNC and not F


443
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:28,856
FULLFSYNC.


444
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,466
It's a much faster and efficient


445
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:31,696
way of getting your data to


446
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:31,966
disk.


447
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,286
Serialized data files.


448
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,766
Files such as plist, XML and


449
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:41,776
JSON, they're great.


450
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,276
They're convenient to use.


451
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,516
They're a great way of storing


452
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,076
infrequently modified data and


453
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:49,416
they're extremely easy to parse.


454
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,586
However, all this ease of use


455
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:52,686
comes with a few tradeoffs.


456
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:57,036
Any time we make a single change


457
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:58,756
to the file, the entire file has


458
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,216
to be re-serialized and


459
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,006
rewritten to disk.


460
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,736
As a result, they scale poorly.


461
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:05,806
And since they're so easy to


462
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,646
use, they can be easy to misuse.


463
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,476
And because we're having to


464
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:10,546
replace the file with every


465
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:11,606
single change, they're very


466
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,056
system file metadata intensive.


467
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:17,086
And they're very much not meant


468
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,316
to be a database replacement.


469
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:22,106
Looking at a screenshot from the


470
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:23,746
file activity Instruments we can


471
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,806
see that the act of creating,


472
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,876
reading, and modifying the plist


473
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,956
causes 12 separate I/O


474
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,826
operations which is quite a bit


475
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,136
for what is probably four lines


476
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:32,976
of code.


477
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,346
And if we look at this in a


478
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,286
slightly different view, then we


479
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,146
see every time we call


480
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,316
NSDictionary to write to file


481
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:41,566
atomically, the operation ends


482
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:42,786
with an fsync operation.


483
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,226
This means that all the data


484
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,286
we're storing in this


485
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,186
NSDictionary we're pushing to


486
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,336
disk is never enjoying the


487
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,806
benefit of the OS cache.


488
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:53,126
As a result, really large data


489
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,376
sets or data sets which are


490
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:56,196
modified frequently aren't


491
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,726
really efficient in a serialized


492
00:14:58,726 --> 00:14:59,376
plist format.


493
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,906
If the amount of data you have


494
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,066
is either too large or too


495
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,516
frequently modified, Core Data


496
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,786
is a really good alternative.


497
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:10,716
Core Data management is built on


498
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,346
SQLite and provides a great


499
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,936
abstraction layer between an


500
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,576
SQLite data source and the model


501
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,256
layer for your app.


502
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:20,056
Core Data automatically manages


503
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,336
object graphs and relationships,


504
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:24,736
support for change tracking and


505
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:28,316
notifications, automatic version


506
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,606
tracking and multi-writer


507
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:30,506
conflict resolution.


508
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:31,706
Core Data will even


509
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:34,456
automatically pull connections


510
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,636
for multiple concurrent


511
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,246
operations.


512
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:39,646
And new with iOS13, Core Data


513
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,756
supports CloudKit integration


514
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:42,976
which is a huge win for Core


515
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:43,706
Data adopters.


516
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,786
And Core Data also supports live


517
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:47,846
queries which allows you to


518
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,986
generate queries on the fly so


519
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,156
you don't have to hand code in


520
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,786
advance all the SQLite queries


521
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,656
you think you might need.


522
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:57,476
Core Data also offers automatic


523
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:00,086
memory management, statement


524
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:03,166
aggregation and transactions,


525
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,466
schema migrations, and new in


526
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,896
iOS 13, data denormalization,


527
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,776
and so much more.


528
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:13,916
We've also observed that


529
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,286
adopters of Core Data have to


530
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,276
write 50 to 70 percent less code


531
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,576
to support their model layer.


532
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,326
That's code that never needs to


533
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,116
be written, modified, or


534
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:22,506
debugged.


535
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,166
If, however you have a use case


536
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,606
which requires the direct use of


537
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,026
SQLite, we do have some best


538
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,266
practices we'd like to share.


539
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,136
This is a bigger topic so we


540
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:32,436
have some subtopics including


541
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,126
connections, journaling,


542
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,726
transactions, file size and


543
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,026
privacy, and partial indexes or


544
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,686
subconnections.


545
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:44,566
The robustness guarantees of


546
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:45,506
SQLite aren't free.


547
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,186
Opening and closing a database


548
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,746
can cause expensive operations


549
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,176
such as consistency checking,


550
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:51,886
journal recovery, and journal


551
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,386
checkpointing.


552
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:55,766
As a result, we actually


553
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,886
recommend not using a more


554
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,146
traditional model of opening and


555
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,606
closing a database each time


556
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:00,086
it's needed.


557
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,066
Instead we recommend the


558
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:02,456
inverse.


559
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,486
Keep the database open as long


560
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,766
as possible and close


561
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,165
connections only when necessary.


562
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,336
For multi-threaded processes,


563
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,996
pull connections so that so long


564
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,406
as one thread still needs the


565
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,675
database the database can remain


566
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:14,036
open.


567
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,086
This really helps amortize the


568
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:17,306
cost of opening and closing a


569
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,516
database over time.


570
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:22,876
Next up, journaling.


571
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,976
Delete mode journaling is the


572
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,165
default journaling mode for


573
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,896
SQLite but it isn't necessarily


574
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:29,686
the most efficient.


575
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,906
To see why let's take a look at


576
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,486
how delete mode journaling


577
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:33,846
works.


578
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:36,486
Let's say we have a database and


579
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,956
we want to modify four pages in


580
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:38,586
it.


581
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:40,506
The first thing that happens, we


582
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,066
end up copying those four pages


583
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:45,746
to a journal file.


584
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,366
We then can modify the four


585
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,486
pages within the database.


586
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,646
And once that's completed, the


587
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:52,716
journal file gets deleted.


588
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:54,606
So if we think about that, we


589
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,066
had to write twice the number of


590
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,226
pages we meant to modify and we


591
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:00,586
had all the file system overhead


592
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:01,876
of this short-lived journal file


593
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:02,696
that we kept around just for a


594
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:03,606
single transaction.


595
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,086
Fortunately, SQLite provides a


596
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,236
much more efficient alternative


597
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:10,986
in Write Ahead Log or WAL Mode


598
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:11,406
Journaling.


599
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,776
WAL Mode Journaling provides a


600
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,086
great way of reducing writes.


601
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,786
It allows us to combine writes


602
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:18,456
to the -- multiple writes to the


603
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:18,986
same page.


604
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:20,476
It uses fewer barriers.


605
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,476
It can support multiple readers


606
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,516
at the same time as a writer,


607
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,086
and supports snapshots.


608
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,156
Let's take a look at how WAL


609
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:27,706
Mode works.


610
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:29,966
So let's say again we have a


611
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:30,986
database and we want to modify


612
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:31,506
four pages.


613
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,306
Instead of modifying pages


614
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:34,786
directly in the database, they


615
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:35,646
just get written to the Write


616
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,906
Ahead Log file and, as we have


617
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:40,006
additional transactions, those


618
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,096
pages get added to the Write


619
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:43,146
Ahead Log file too until the


620
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:44,096
Write Ahead Log file gets


621
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,226
sufficiently large and it makes


622
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:46,096
sense to checkpoint it.


623
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,126
And, when we checkpoint it we


624
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:50,266
get one of the huge wins of WAL


625
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,036
Mode, pages which would've been


626
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,866
modified multiple times in a


627
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,536
Delete Mode database, all those


628
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,816
changes to the same page get


629
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,776
merged during the WAL checkpoint


630
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:01,006
and that same page only needs to


631
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,096
be written out once.


632
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:06,136
And when we're done, a simple


633
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:06,976
overwrite of the header of the


634
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,476
WAL file is all that's needed to


635
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,916
make it available for future use


636
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,416
thus reducing the file system


637
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,596
cost of maintaining this Write


638
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:13,336
Ahead Log file.


639
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:17,536
So we can see WAL Mode is more


640
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,306
efficient for most use cases of


641
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:19,726
SQLite.


642
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,136
If you weren't already using WAL


643
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:22,536
Mode for your SQLite databases,


644
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:23,936
we highly recommend switching


645
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:24,646
over to WAL Mode.


646
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,306
It can be a great way of getting


647
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:27,986
some huge performance wins for


648
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:28,446
your app.


649
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,076
Using multiple INSERT and UPDATE


650
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,036
and DELETE statements in a


651
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,386
single transaction is a great


652
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:34,906
way of giving SQLite more


653
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,176
information so that it can make


654
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,526
more efficient operations on


655
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:37,956
your behalf.


656
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,076
Pages that are changed multiple


657
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,616
times by, in the same


658
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,536
transaction by multiple


659
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,906
statements, only get written out


660
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:45,576
to disk once.


661
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,176
Let's say in this example we


662
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:48,856
have three separate


663
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,266
transactions, each with one


664
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,476
statement that modify the same


665
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:52,296
page in the database.


666
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,036
We'll see the same page in the


667
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,556
database get modified three


668
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:55,976
times.


669
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,856
If, however, we had a single


670
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:00,336
transaction with those three


671
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:02,506
statements, all those changes


672
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:03,786
would get combined and the page


673
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,666
in the database would only get


674
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,026
written out once.


675
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,956
As a result, using multiple


676
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:10,456
statements in a single SQLite


677
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,776
transaction is a great way for


678
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,546
aggregating changes over time.


679
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:18,906
File size and privacy.


680
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:22,106
So what happens when we delete


681
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:22,996
data from the database?


682
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:25,146
Space containing the deleted


683
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:27,396
data is marked as free and while


684
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:28,176
it's no longer part of the


685
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,706
database, it's still technically


686
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:30,176
on disk.


687
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,786
So how do we securely delete


688
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,146
sensitive information in an


689
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:35,476
efficient manner?


690
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,466
We recommend using secure


691
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,386
delete=fast.


692
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,306
secure delete=fast is great.


693
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:44,116
It automatically zeroes deleted


694
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,986
data and there is no cost for


695
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,186
data that was in the same page


696
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,156
as the header file that we had


697
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,256
to modify to mark the data as


698
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:49,696
being free.


699
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:51,766
And it's also now the default


700
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,336
behavior for SQLite in the iOS


701
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:53,786
13.


702
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:55,886
If you need it for older builds


703
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:58,366
of iOS, please specify the


704
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,516
secure delete=fast pragma.


705
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,056
When it comes to managing the


706
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,906
size of our database files, we


707
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:08,576
highly recommend not using


708
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:09,046
VACUUM.


709
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:12,716
VACUUM is a very slow memory and


710
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:13,996
I/O intensive operation.


711
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,376
To better understand why let's


712
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,276
take a look at how VACUUM for


713
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,346
SQLite databases work.


714
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,956
So let's say we have a database


715
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:21,936
and we wanted to VACUUM out all


716
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:22,596
the free pages.


717
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,896
What happens is we end up


718
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:26,426
opening up a cache door to our


719
00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:27,786
database, a journal file gets


720
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,046
created, then we end up


721
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,096
performing an SQLite dump from


722
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:32,416
the database to the journal file


723
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,416
copying all of the valid data


724
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,916
from our database to the journal


725
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,236
file.


726
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:38,816
Then later when it's time to


727
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,596
checkpoint the journal file, the


728
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:42,056
database gets truncated to the


729
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:44,686
size of the journal file and all


730
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,226
the data from the journal gets


731
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,526
reinserted back to the database.


732
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,886
And then when that's complete,


733
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,396
the journal file gets discarded.


734
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,136
As we can see, this is pretty


735
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:56,686
expensive as all of the valid


736
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:57,706
data we had in our database had


737
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:58,946
to be written at least twice,


738
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,336
once to the journal file and


739
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,876
then once again back into the


740
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:02,366
database.


741
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:06,056
And if the working side of the


742
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,576
database is too big to fit into


743
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,726
memory, SQLite actually has to


744
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:11,416
utilize spill files to help


745
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,466
manage the extra data until the


746
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,506
operation is complete.


747
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,136
Again, fortunately there's a


748
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,466
much more efficient alternative


749
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:22,726
in SQLite and in this case


750
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:24,356
that's auto vacuum=INCREMENTAL.


751
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,596
auto VACUUM incremental is great


752
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,556
because not only does it allow


753
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:28,586
us a more efficient way of


754
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,966
managing the size of the


755
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:32,076
database file, it lets us


756
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,406
specify the number of pages we


757
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:34,346
want to vacuum out of the


758
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:36,446
database providing an option for


759
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:37,766
leaving some free pages in the


760
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,276
database for future use.


761
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,406
Let's take a look at how auto


762
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,766
vacuum=INCREMENTAL works.


763
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,636
So in this example we're going


764
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:49,546
to vacuum out the two free


765
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:49,966
pages.


766
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,066
Whereas before we would have had


767
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,296
to move all of our data from the


768
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,836
database in the WAL file, for


769
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,466
incremental auto vacuum, all we


770
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,496
do is migrate two pages from the


771
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:00,886
end of the database into the


772
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:04,066
Write Ahead Log and any parent


773
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,156
nodes that get modified during


774
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,576
the rebalance of the database


775
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:08,786
tree also get written to the


776
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:09,416
Write Ahead Log.


777
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,246
Then, when the Write Ahead Log


778
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,776
gets checkpointed, the database


779
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,126
file itself gets truncated, the


780
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:18,566
pages we migrated from the end


781
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:19,606
of the database go to where the


782
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,056
free pages used to be, and any


783
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,686
updated parent nodes get written


784
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:23,416
to the database.


785
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,386
So as you can see, whereas


786
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:26,466
before we had to move all of our


787
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:27,616
data in and out of the database,


788
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,056
now we're simply modifying a


789
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,576
subset of the pages within the


790
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:30,976
database.


791
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,146
This is much more efficient.


792
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:35,436
There's all -- we highly


793
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,726
recommend using incremental auto


794
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,426
vacuum and fast secure delete to


795
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:40,796
manage both file size and


796
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,006
privacy for your SQLite


797
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:42,546
databases.


798
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:48,946
Partial indexes.


799
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:52,686
Indexes are great.


800
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,686
Indexes allow for faster ORDER


801
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:56,356
BY, GROUP BY, and WHERE clauses.


802
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,366
Unfortunately, they aren't free.


803
00:23:58,586 --> 00:23:59,416
There's a certain amount of


804
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,486
overhead the database needs to


805
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,876
do to support these indexes.


806
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:03,986
And after we add more indexes,


807
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,326
each new write of data to the


808
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:07,446
database can become more


809
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:07,966
expensive.


810
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,786
Fortunately, there's a more


811
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:11,686
efficient alternative in the


812
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:12,886
form of partial indexes.


813
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:14,806
Partial indexes allow you to


814
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:16,336
describe where you'd want to pay


815
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:17,796
the price of your index using a


816
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:19,846
WHERE clause which is great


817
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:21,686
because now you can get the


818
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,186
benefits of an index when you


819
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:25,236
want it, but not -- but not


820
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:26,296
necessarily having to pay the


821
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:27,556
price of the index when it won't


822
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:27,976
do you any benefit.


823
00:24:33,526 --> 00:24:35,526
So in summary for SQLite, please


824
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:38,706
keep database connections open


825
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:41,436
as long as possible.


826
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:43,086
Use WAL journaling mode instead


827
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:44,706
of delete journaling mode.


828
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,216
Whenever possible, use multiple


829
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,626
statements per transaction so


830
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,536
SQLite can do some optimizations


831
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:51,686
for us.


832
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,416
Use fast secure delete and auto


833
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,116
vacuum incremental to manage


834
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,416
both file size and privacy for


835
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,166
your databases.


836
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:01,246
And, when it's practical, use


837
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:02,546
partial indexes instead of


838
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:03,206
regular indexes.


839
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:07,586
And if you'd really rather not


840
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:09,286
worry about these details in


841
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:11,066
SQLite, we highly recommend just


842
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:11,906
using Core Data.


843
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,226
Core Data handles all this heavy


844
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:15,806
lifting for you and as Core Data


845
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,206
gets improved over time,


846
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:19,246
adopters of Core Data will also


847
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,496
get those benefits for free.


848
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:26,756
Next up Alejandro will show us


849
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,036
how we can use the updated File


850
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,866
Activity instrument and show us


851
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:30,956
real-world examples of how we


852
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:32,686
can profile and optimize I/O for


853
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:32,956
apps.


854
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:33,946
Alejandro.


855
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:41,256
[ Applause ]


856
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:42,816
>> All right thank you Kai.


857
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,646
And good morning everyone.


858
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:45,596
Thank you for attending this


859
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:46,946
session on optimizing storage.


860
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,456
What I'd like to do is talk


861
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:50,536
about some of the improvements


862
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:51,696
we've made to the File Activity


863
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:53,216
instrument to see how we can use


864
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:55,036
that to optimize storage in our


865
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:55,156
app.


866
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:56,616
So let's get started.


867
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:58,606
What changed with the File


868
00:25:58,606 --> 00:25:59,866
Activity instrument?


869
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,206
Well, one of the first things we


870
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:03,706
did was we added support for all


871
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:04,476
Apple devices.


872
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:05,786
So this means you can have the


873
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,026
same uniform profiling


874
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:08,636
experience across your iOS


875
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:11,426
device, Mac, Watch, TV,


876
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:11,976
etcetera.


877
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:16,406
The File Activity instrument


878
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:18,066
also lets you support tracing


879
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:18,846
for not just your own


880
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:20,176
application but also for the


881
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:22,126
entire system so you can see how


882
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,866
your application behaves with


883
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,856
regards to the I/O subsystem


884
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,736
alone and how it interacts with


885
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:28,986
the rest of the system so you


886
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:29,976
can see different interactions


887
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:30,316
going on.


888
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:34,156
Next as Kai mentioned, there is


889
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,496
the distinction between logical


890
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,286
and physical I/O.


891
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,616
And understanding how they


892
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:38,566
interact with each other is


893
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,346
actually really important for --


894
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:42,116
to understand your I/O usage.


895
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:43,526
So the File Activity instrument


896
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:44,786
lets us see both of these


897
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:45,156
together.


898
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:48,796
And lastly, we also added


899
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:50,176
support for automated reasoning.


900
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,856
And the automated reasoning


901
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:52,946
comes in a variety of different


902
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,186
mechanisms, so I'd like to talk


903
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,256
about this very briefly.


904
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:58,666
First and foremost, one of the


905
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,336
automated reasoning anti-pattern


906
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:01,346
detections that we added was


907
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:02,406
actually that for excessive


908
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,156
physical rights.


909
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:04,726
So the File Activity instrument


910
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:06,316
will actually notify you while


911
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:08,046
you're tracing that it detected


912
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:09,596
some sort of excessive activity


913
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,946
in your application and you can


914
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,366
go in directly from instruments


915
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,266
and see what may have caused it.


916
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:18,086
We also added support for seeing


917
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:19,706
when certain I/O related system


918
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:20,796
calls that either you call


919
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,176
directly or maybe are called on


920
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:23,116
your behalf because of a


921
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,606
framework have failed.


922
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:25,806
And these are important to


923
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,836
understand, not just for I/O but


924
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:28,906
also for correctness in your


925
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:29,336
application.


926
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:33,196
And lastly, to Kai's points


927
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,986
about fsync and F control with F


928
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,886
FULLFSYNC, we also have a


929
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:37,876
mechanism for detecting


930
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,686
suboptimal caching so you can


931
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,276
see when your application might


932
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,696
be performing certain behaviors


933
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:43,966
that aren't making the best


934
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,286
utilization of the OS cache.


935
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:46,946
So let's get started with File


936
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:48,226
Activity instrument and see what


937
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:49,546
it looks like.


938
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:50,996
With Instruments 11, when we


939
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,836
open up the instruments, we see


940
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,336
the file activity still has


941
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:55,856
roughly the same icon but we get


942
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:57,216
a new string at the bottom which


943
00:27:57,216 --> 00:27:58,106
kind of sums up what it's


944
00:27:58,106 --> 00:27:58,826
capable of doing.


945
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:00,906
And if we go ahead and select


946
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,466
it, we're presented with some


947
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,076
new tracks.


948
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:04,996
First and foremost is the file


949
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,166
system suggestions track.


950
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:07,986
And this track is where all of


951
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,926
these anti-patterns and


952
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:10,446
automated reasoning suggestions


953
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:11,706
will live.


954
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,186
Directly beneath it we have file


955
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:14,846
system activity and the file


956
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:16,076
system activity will be broken


957
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,236
down for logical reads and


958
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,006
logical writes and it'll show


959
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,306
you a count of how many of these


960
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:21,236
operations happened.


961
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:22,826
And you're also able to see in


962
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,376
more depth how many calls were


963
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,996
made, who called them, and


964
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,006
certain other statistics.


965
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,696
Similarly, right beneath it is


966
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:30,926
disk usage where you can get the


967
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:32,436
same sort of read and write


968
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:33,836
distinction but for the physical


969
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:34,156
layer.


970
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:36,756
And lastly, the disk I/O latency


971
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,116
so we can see just how long


972
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,436
certain physical I/Os took.


973
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:41,456
So let's get started and I'll


974
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,786
refer back to this demo app.


975
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:44,676
And the first thing I'd like to


976
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:46,286
implement is actually favoriting


977
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:46,936
of photos.


978
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,236
So in the bottom right-hand


979
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,446
corner of each of these images


980
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,896
there's a star and what I'd like


981
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,856
to implement is being able to


982
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,476
select that star to consider an


983
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:54,236
image a favorite.


984
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:56,376
As an example, I can select a


985
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,606
banana slug as a favorite as


986
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:00,536
well as these skyscrapers.


987
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:02,296
And the very first approach that


988
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:03,986
I'll take is implementing this


989
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:05,106
by opening and closing the


990
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,506
database every time that we have


991
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:07,076
a favoriting.


992
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,066
Now Kai told us that this isn't


993
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,566
the best pattern but I still


994
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,736
think it's useful to get this


995
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:12,946
into a File Activity instrument


996
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,456
trace so we have a baseline and


997
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:15,526
we can see what sorts of things


998
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:15,936
are happening.


999
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,546
So here behind me I have exactly


1000
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:19,826
that.


1001
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,456
I ran the File Activity


1002
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:22,616
instrument against this same


1003
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,136
workload by opening and closing


1004
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:25,296
the database per operation.


1005
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:26,926
And the first track I'd like to


1006
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,336
focus on is disk usage because


1007
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,366
this is where all the physical


1008
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,326
I/O information will live.


1009
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,966
Here we see in the physical


1010
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:34,376
writes column or the physical


1011
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:35,876
writes row, we see the different


1012
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:36,966
amount of physical I/Os that


1013
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:37,346
happen.


1014
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,926
In this case in the tool tip


1015
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:40,836
text we have 54 for this


1016
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,566
particular column.


1017
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,056
But right beneath it is the


1018
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,306
detail view and the detail view


1019
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:45,146
is where all of the extra


1020
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:46,256
statistics will live so I'm


1021
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,476
going to go into here so we can


1022
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,816
see what sort of things we're


1023
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:49,646
getting.


1024
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:52,786
By zooming in I'd like to point


1025
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,946
out that for this workload of


1026
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:57,006
favoriting these photos with the


1027
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:58,296
opening and closing database per


1028
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,426
operation, we had 1,002


1029
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:01,406
different physical I/O


1030
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:03,076
operations totaling just under 6


1031
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:03,976
megabytes of total footprint.


1032
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,466
And this may not seem like that


1033
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:07,666
much but when we compare it to


1034
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,546
some of the other ones, we'll


1035
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:09,606
get a better understanding of


1036
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,556
why this is perhaps as bad as it


1037
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:11,816
is.


1038
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:13,946
So here we get some statistics


1039
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,486
about, you know, latency and


1040
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:16,476
average latencies as well.


1041
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:18,476
But I would like to switch back


1042
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:20,356
to the overall view because I


1043
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:21,426
also noticed that in the file


1044
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:22,936
system suggestions track, we do


1045
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:24,476
have some notifications that the


1046
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:26,136
instrument told us and I'd like


1047
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:27,866
to go into these as well so we


1048
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:28,686
can see just what happened.


1049
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,026
Again, at the bottom we have the


1050
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,306
detail view, and here the detail


1051
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:33,846
view in that count column is


1052
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:35,466
telling us that we had 12 total


1053
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,356
notifications.


1054
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:39,576
And if we go into that dropdown,


1055
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:40,906
we see that these notifications


1056
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,296
were precisely for excessive


1057
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,076
physical rights.


1058
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:44,756
And we know that opening and


1059
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:45,876
closing the database isn't


1060
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,406
necessarily a good thing and


1061
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:48,266
we're going to try different


1062
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:49,526
techniques so we can get this.


1063
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:50,676
But I like to start off with


1064
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:51,776
this baseline of 12


1065
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:52,796
notifications from the file


1066
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:53,986
system -- File Activity


1067
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:54,376
instrument.


1068
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,686
And lastly, I also want to talk


1069
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:00,066
about the actual file system


1070
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,786
activity track where we can see


1071
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:02,986
statistics about which


1072
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,526
operations were called such as


1073
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:05,896
writes and reads and so forth,


1074
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,946
but also in this table here we


1075
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,126
get different views of the


1076
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:11,056
logical I/Os that our


1077
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:11,826
application did.


1078
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:13,286
Here are the default is file


1079
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:14,556
system statistics but we can


1080
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,176
also go down to file descriptor


1081
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:17,446
information as well.


1082
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,056
All right so with that in mind,


1083
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,556
now I want to go and switch to a


1084
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:24,796
different model which is opening


1085
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:25,926
and closing the database as


1086
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:26,276
needed.


1087
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,486
Specifically I'll go back into


1088
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,926
the disk usage detail view and


1089
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:31,536
the first thing that I'd like to


1090
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:33,246
point out is we're down from


1091
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:35,526
1,002 physical I/O operations


1092
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,736
down to 54 and we're down from


1093
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:39,196
just under 6 megabytes of disk


1094
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,976
footprint to 288 kilobytes which


1095
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:43,336
is quite a significant win and


1096
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,866
this was simply just by changing


1097
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:46,686
the usage model of when we open


1098
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:47,846
and close our database.


1099
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,266
Furthermore, focusing again on


1100
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,976
file system suggestions, we


1101
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:54,636
started off with 12 in the


1102
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,506
previous version of doing this


1103
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:58,886
but now we're down to 3.


1104
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:00,566
And while this still isn't the


1105
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,046
ideal case, we are making


1106
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:02,586
progress.


1107
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,776
And as we implement different


1108
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:05,396
behavior such as journaling,


1109
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:06,386
we'll see this number change.


1110
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:09,536
Speaking of which, let's start


1111
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,386
with Delete Mode Journaling.


1112
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:11,566
Now as Kai mentioned, Delete


1113
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,686
Mode Journaling is the default


1114
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:15,126
for SQLite and so this


1115
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:16,566
statistics page that I have here


1116
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,966
is actually the same exact one


1117
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:18,996
that I showed where we were


1118
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:20,176
opening and closing the database


1119
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:20,726
as needed.


1120
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,866
So I won't show the entire trace


1121
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,306
again but I do want to recall


1122
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:24,796
the numbers.


1123
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:26,716
54 physical I/O operations


1124
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:28,196
totaling 288 kilobytes.


1125
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,096
But when we switch to a model


1126
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:33,306
that uses WAL Mode Journaling


1127
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:34,186
there are some interesting


1128
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,176
observations that I'd like to


1129
00:32:35,176 --> 00:32:36,206
point out.


1130
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,576
First and foremost is that now


1131
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:40,506
we have zero suggestions on the


1132
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:41,716
file systems suggestions track.


1133
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:44,026
We started at 12, ended up at 3,


1134
00:32:44,026 --> 00:32:45,306
and now we're at zero so this is


1135
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,536
very significant gains that


1136
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:48,276
we're making by simply adopting


1137
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,126
the WAL Mode Journaling.


1138
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,856
And secondly, this is the


1139
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:53,246
interaction between the logical


1140
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:54,406
and physical I/O that I'd also


1141
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:54,996
like to point out.


1142
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:57,346
Specifically, here in the file


1143
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,976
system activity track we see a


1144
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,636
lot of logical I/Os happening,


1145
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:02,916
but we don't get a physical I/O


1146
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,516
until we stop the trace of the


1147
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,136
application.


1148
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:06,816
And why is this significant?


1149
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:08,486
Well when we compare it to what


1150
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,936
we had previously with the


1151
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:12,706
Delete Mode Journaling, notice


1152
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:13,666
how in Delete Mode Journaling


1153
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:14,726
every time that we had file


1154
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,436
system activity, so logical I/O,


1155
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:17,786
we also had a corresponding


1156
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:18,986
physical I/O to go with it.


1157
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:20,766
Whereas with WAL Mode Journaling


1158
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,256
it's making really great use of


1159
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:23,496
the OS cache and getting us a


1160
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:24,446
lot of great performance


1161
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:25,246
benefits.


1162
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:27,646
To see this in a little more


1163
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:28,896
detail we can go into that file


1164
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:30,616
system activity track again and


1165
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:31,706
focus on the detail view.


1166
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:34,216
With WAL Mode journaling we only


1167
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,866
had a single fsync call whereas


1168
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:37,426
with Delete Mode Journaling we


1169
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,916
were all the way up to 16.


1170
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:41,286
So WAL Mode is definitely making


1171
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,796
a lot of great use of the OS


1172
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:42,916
cache.


1173
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,496
Now the next thing I'd like to


1174
00:33:47,496 --> 00:33:48,756
talk about is how we're going to


1175
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:50,146
implement deleting of photos.


1176
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:51,056
We talked about favoriting, but


1177
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,126
we also want a way to remove


1178
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:53,656
photos from the application.


1179
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:55,736
And the first approach that


1180
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:56,676
we'll talk about is actually


1181
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:57,496
using what's called single


1182
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:58,586
statement transactions and Kai


1183
00:33:58,586 --> 00:33:59,406
mentioned this as well.


1184
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,526
Specifically, when we want to


1185
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:02,786
select a photo for deletion,


1186
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:03,736
we'll select the checkmark at


1187
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:05,326
the bottom left corner, and


1188
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:06,886
we'll issue a delete query to


1189
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,085
the database.


1190
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:09,016
Now we could think of this as a


1191
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,186
single statement transaction


1192
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:11,606
because we're executing this


1193
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,366
delete query per photo and we're


1194
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,856
not doing any sort of coalescing


1195
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:17,485
on our own.


1196
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:18,626
With this model here's the


1197
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,726
single statement transaction


1198
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,255
approach and we do have some


1199
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:22,576
file system activity to point


1200
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:23,856
out as well as some disk usage.


1201
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,186
But one thing to focus on is


1202
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:27,985
with this approach we had 111


1203
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,446
different file system operations


1204
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,565
and going over to the disk usage


1205
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,856
track we had 12 writes for a


1206
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:36,335
total of 72 kilobytes of total


1207
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:36,726
footprint.


1208
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:40,835
Next, I'd like to talk about


1209
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,106
multiple statement transactions


1210
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,556
and this is by taking the idea


1211
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:45,166
that each of these photos, even


1212
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,726
from a logical perspective, we


1213
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,106
don't want to delete these


1214
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:49,505
photos one at a time.


1215
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:50,636
Logically we want to get them


1216
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,456
all deleted at the same time and


1217
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,585
we have an analog for this


1218
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:55,545
within SQLite by merging all


1219
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:56,876
these delete statements into one


1220
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:57,456
transaction.


1221
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:58,746
So we have multiple statements


1222
00:34:58,746 --> 00:34:59,626
in a single transaction.


1223
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:02,586
And if we do this, we're down to


1224
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:04,266
37 file system operations.


1225
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,296
So we're doing significantly


1226
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,616
less work but in addition to


1227
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,146
that if we look at the disk


1228
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,076
usage we're down to 4 total


1229
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,046
writes and 24 kilobytes of


1230
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:14,496
footprint.


1231
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:17,596
Looking at these side by side,


1232
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,856
we started with 111 for single


1233
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,016
statement transactions of total


1234
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,756
file system activity, we're down


1235
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,656
to 37 with multiple statement


1236
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,226
transactions.


1237
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,056
And looking to how this


1238
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:28,506
translates to actual physical


1239
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:31,016
disk usage, we started at 12


1240
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,316
writes totaling 72 kilobytes and


1241
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,486
now we're down to 4 writes


1242
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:35,816
totaling 24 kilobytes with


1243
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:36,966
multiple statement transactions.


1244
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:40,006
And while we're on the topic of


1245
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,596
deleting, we should also mention


1246
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:42,606
vacuuming because we want to


1247
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:44,046
keep our database compressed or,


1248
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:45,236
you know, compact as possible.


1249
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:46,966
And we'll start off with a full


1250
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:47,416
vacuum.


1251
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:49,036
In this case we'll be issuing a


1252
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:50,726
vacuum statement every time that


1253
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:51,566
we issue a delete.


1254
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,166
And Kai told us that full


1255
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,916
vacuuming isn't the most optimal


1256
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,316
way of doing it, but we can see


1257
00:35:56,316 --> 00:35:57,586
how this exactly works within


1258
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:58,696
the File Activity instrument.


1259
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,896
Specifically, by doing this we


1260
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:04,116
have a total of 27 different I/O


1261
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:05,766
operations totaling 168


1262
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:06,796
kilobytes by issuing a full


1263
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:10,476
vacuum, but if we switch this


1264
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:11,956
over to using incremental


1265
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:14,206
vacuum, we have some different


1266
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:14,776
numbers.


1267
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,416
We have 12 total I/O operations


1268
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:18,926
for 72 kilobytes of total


1269
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,336
footprint.


1270
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,616
Again, looking at these side by


1271
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:26,256
side, we're down from 27 I/O


1272
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:27,556
operations with a full vacuum


1273
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,216
down to 12 by using incremental


1274
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:32,566
vacuum and from 168K of total


1275
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,216
disk footprint for the full


1276
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:35,296
vacuum down to 72.


1277
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:37,166
So it's pretty significant gains


1278
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,226
that we're making by adopting


1279
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,296
these sorts of patterns within


1280
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:39,736
SQLite.


1281
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,126
So what I'd like to do now is


1282
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,826
sort of summarize and one of the


1283
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:48,636
first points is we want you to


1284
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:49,746
apply these lessons, whether


1285
00:36:49,746 --> 00:36:51,936
you're using Core Data or SQLite


1286
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:53,476
or plist and so forth, we want


1287
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,336
you to apply these lessons but


1288
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,166
don't just apply them.


1289
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,886
We also want you to verify them


1290
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,736
with the File Activity


1291
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,146
instrument.


1292
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:00,676
Now the File Activity instrument


1293
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,826
may be able to help you by


1294
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:03,606
proving these points but also


1295
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:04,396
you may have some other


1296
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:05,626
suggestions that you don't even


1297
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:06,886
know about and perhaps the File


1298
00:37:06,886 --> 00:37:08,286
Activity instrument can help


1299
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:09,586
bring those into vision for you


1300
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:10,496
and help you notice them.


1301
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,066
And with that in mind, we also


1302
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,116
want you to continue optimizing


1303
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:15,546
storage.


1304
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:17,336
There's a lot more than just


1305
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,436
meets the eye and we hope that


1306
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,406
with these lessons and with the


1307
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,746
tools that we're providing it


1308
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:21,896
could be a great experience for


1309
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:22,196
everyone.


1310
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:25,546
For more information we have a


1311
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,226
lab later on today for


1312
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:28,716
performance and we also had a


1313
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,866
session this year at WWDC '19


1314
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,256
for making apps with Core Data


1315
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,106
if you'd like to learn a little


1316
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:34,486
bit more about how exactly to


1317
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:34,976
adopt this.


1318
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,326
Thank you everyone for


1319
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:38,676
attending.


1320
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:39,626
Enjoy the rest of the session.
