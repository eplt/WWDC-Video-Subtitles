[ Applause ]


3
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,586
>> Good afternoon and
welcome to session 226,


4
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:33,706
What's New in CloudKit.


5
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,576
My name is Paul Seligman.


6
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:39,116
I'm an engineer on the CloudKit
client team and I'm very excited


7
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:41,646
to be with you here today
to talk about some updates


8
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:43,786
and new features in
the CloudKit ecosystem.


9
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,756
So, what are we going
to talk about today?


10
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:47,266
We're going to start off today


11
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,356
with a quick overview
of what is CloudKit.


12
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,596
We're then going to switch
gears and talk about Telemetry,


13
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,766
a new feature which
gives you the ability


14
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,346
to visualize how your
CloudKit-backed applications


15
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:57,926
are behaving.


16
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:01,016
We're going to talk about
some improvements to our APIs


17
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,486
and their availabilities.


18
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:06,356
And we're going to talk
about sharing, a new feature


19
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,146
which gives your
users the ability


20
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:10,776
to share their data while
maintaining full control


21
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:14,546
over who has access to it.


22
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:16,916
So, what is CloudKit?


23
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:20,156
CloudKit is a technology
that gives you the ability


24
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,406
to have your application data


25
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,136
and your user data available
wherever you need it.


26
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,366
CloudKit is a framework
which gives you access


27
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,096
to a database stored on iCloud.


28
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,156
We use CloudKit extensively
inside of Apple.


29
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,826
This gives you the confidence to
know that we are committed to it


30
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,436
and it gives us the confidence
to know that we can scale


31
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:39,926
to hundreds of millions
of users.


32
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:44,426
CloudKit is available on
all of Apple's platforms.


33
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:49,656
Now, I'm going to quickly
summarize an introduction


34
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,536
to CloudKit, covering topics
that we did a few years ago


35
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:53,746
in introduction to CloudKit.


36
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:56,646
I recommend you go check out
that session after this one


37
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:58,906
if you'd like a broader
introduction to the ecosystem.


38
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,816
I'd also like to mention these
talks which go into more detail


39
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,436
about specific aspects
of CloudKit.


40
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:06,836
You can use these to
find ways that you


41
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,295
and your application can use
CloudKit to your advantage.


42
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,466
Now, all the sessions
are online and are linked


43
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,936
from
developer.apple.com/CloudKit.


44
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,696
Here we see the list of objects


45
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,426
that every developer
using CloudKit needs


46
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:22,136
to be familiar with.


47
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:25,656
Let's step through them
starting with Containers.


48
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:30,046
A Container is the mechanism by
which we silo data up on iCloud.


49
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:32,566
So, notes uses a Container.


50
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,206
Photos uses a Container and your
Applicationm when built on top


51
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,846
of CloudKit, will also have
access to its own Container.


52
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,546
If we look inside
of a Container,


53
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,236
we see that Containers
contains databases.


54
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:47,206
And until last week
this is our data model.


55
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,706
A Container had two databases,
the public and the private.


56
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:53,036
With the introduction
of Sharing,


57
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,146
we introduced a third database
type, the Shared database.


58
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:57,896
More about that in a little bit.


59
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,976
The basic unit of storage
inside of CloudKit is a record.


60
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:06,896
A record is a group of key value
pairs and typically it maps


61
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,536
to an object model, an
object in your data model.


62
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,286
Now, we don't store records
loosely inside of databases.


63
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,626
Rather, we encapsulate
records inside of Record Zones.


64
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,886
Many records can exist
inside of a record zone


65
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:23,146
and many Record Zones can
exist inside of a database.


66
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,476
Different databases support
different types of Record Zones.


67
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:31,056
The public and private databases
have a default record zone.


68
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:32,866
This is where all your
records are going to end


69
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,736
up unless you specify otherwise.


70
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,486
Your private database can also
contain custom Record Zones


71
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,096
which are zones that
your application creates


72
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,596
and uploads into the database.


73
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:46,056
And lastly, the new
shared database consists


74
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:47,226
of shared Record Zones.


75
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,906
With the introduction
of sharing,


76
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:53,186
we're going to add one new
core concept to this list.


77
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:54,546
The concept of a Share.


78
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:58,646
A Share is a subclass
of a Record and as such,


79
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,906
lives alongside Records
inside of Record Zones.


80
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,596
You can think of a Record as
being the thing that you want


81
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,706
to share and Share representing
how you're going to share it,


82
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,666
things like participants
and permissions.


83
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,866
Again, we'll get more
into that in a little bit.


84
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,276
Just know that it exists.


85
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:18,286
Now, I mentioned that we use
CloudKit extensively inside


86
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:20,236
of Apple and I wanted
to take a moment


87
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:21,896
to highlight some
of our clients.


88
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,906
In the public database
are a couple applications


89
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:28,376
that you've probably used,
the WWDC App and the News App.


90
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,176
The News App in particular
stores article content, images,


91
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:33,656
etc., in the public database.


92
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,816
And it's a great use
of the public database.


93
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,556
Storing content that you
want generally accessible


94
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:39,536
to all of your users.


95
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:43,046
And we can contrast this
with the private database.


96
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,236
The private database
is where you're going


97
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,646
to store the user's
private data.


98
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:49,096
We have several clients
of this inside


99
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:52,266
of Apple including iCloud
Backup, iCloud Drive,


100
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,486
iCloud Photo Library and Notes.


101
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,986
And I'm happy to report
that two new features,


102
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,366
Notes Collaboration and
Activity Sharing are both built


103
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,576
on top of CloudKit Sharing.


104
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:05,876
So, as such, the Notes


105
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,886
and Activity Applications are
clients of the shared database.


106
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:15,176
Two years ago we
introduced CloudKit


107
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:16,846
by providing two
native frameworks,


108
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,886
one on iOS and one on macOS.


109
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,796
Last year we extended that
family, adding a data framework


110
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:26,566
for tvOS and two web
frameworks, CloudKit JS


111
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,996
and CloudKit Web Services.


112
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:32,206
The web frameworks give your
users access to CloudKit data,


113
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,666
whether they're on the
web or on a platform


114
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,736
that doesn't have a native
framework alternative.


115
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,686
And this year we're going to go
ahead and complete the circle


116
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,316
by adding a native
framework on watchOS.


117
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,976
With this, we now have a native
CloudKit framework available


118
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,536
across all of Apple's platforms.


119
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,636
Let's take a moment and step


120
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:54,426
through some notable
platform-specific changes


121
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:54,836
this year.


122
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:56,596
Starting with macOS.


123
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,896
The big news that we
want to share with you is


124
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:00,996
that you no longer need


125
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:04,166
to distribute your application
via the Mac App Store in order


126
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,186
to take advantage of CloudKit.


127
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,316
[ Applause ]


128
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,986
Using the new iCloud for
Developer ID feature,


129
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,706
you can directly entitle your
application to use CloudKit


130
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:18,886
and other iCloud services via
your permissioning profiles.


131
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,706
Next I want to talk
about server to server.


132
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,866
This is a feature that's
been out in the wild


133
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,736
for a few months now and it's
the, gives you the ability


134
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:31,326
to have your servers directly
talk to CloudKit servers


135
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:32,856
as administrative users.


136
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:35,766
Your servers can
authenticate themselves


137
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,316
to CloudKit using a
public/private key pair you've


138
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,496
previously established on
the CloudKit Dashboard.


139
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:45,386
And you can set your servers
to have full rewrite access


140
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:46,346
to the public database.


141
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,126
This is a great way for
you to import your data


142
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,586
from your servers into
CloudKit or to export data


143
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:55,336
from CloudKit to your servers.


144
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,026
Or to keep two sets
of data up-to-date


145
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,626
between your servers
and CloudKit.


146
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:05,356
With the introduction of
CloudKit as a native framework


147
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,946
on watchOS, you now
have another mechanism


148
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,986
to keep your watch Apps and
your iOS Apps up-to-date.


149
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,436
In that way, you can think
of CloudKit as an alternative


150
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,866
to the watch connectivity
framework.


151
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,516
And CloudKit comes with
one notable advantage.


152
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,736
That is standalone
functionality.


153
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,916
CloudKit uses NSURL
session and as a result,


154
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,906
we're going to send our network


155
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,406
over the best available
interface.


156
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,866
If your watch is
connected to an iOS device,


157
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,936
we'll send traffic
over that iOS device.


158
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,696
But the watch is also
capable of talking directly


159
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,936
to CloudKit servers
when it's on Wi-Fi.


160
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,026
Now, we are presenting
a full-ish version


161
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,436
of the CloudKit API.


162
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,186
With the introduction of
CloudKit as the native framework


163
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:49,106
on watchOS, you now
have the ability


164
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:51,696
to write similar application
code that uses CloudKit


165
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,596
across all of Apple's platforms.


166
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:57,306
The Activity App for
example has used this


167
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:00,896
to write similar CloudKit
code on iOS and on watchOS


168
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,936
to provide the activity
sharing future.


169
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:07,516
Now, notice I said similar
code and not identical code.


170
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:09,426
As you write code and
deploy it to the variety


171
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,676
of Apple's platforms,
you need to keep in mind


172
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:13,846
that the strengths and
realities of each platform.


173
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:15,726
In other words, you're going


174
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,596
to hit limited resources
in some cases.


175
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,646
You need to keep in mind
the CPU characteristics,


176
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:23,726
the storage capacities and
the network characteristics


177
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,226
such as latency and throughput.


178
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:29,496
You can use this in determining
how often you want to talk


179
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,406
to the servers and how
much data you're willing


180
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,385
to send over the wire.


181
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,626
As always, testing
is the best way


182
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:39,265
to tune your App appropriately
for the platform and ensure


183
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,176
that your users are going


184
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,706
to have the best
possible experience.


185
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:47,636
Now I'd like to change gears
and talk about Telemetry.


186
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:50,936
Telemetry is a new
feature which allows you


187
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,596
to visualize the behavior


188
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,286
of your CloudKit-backed
applications.


189
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,596
We surface Telemetry as a series
of charts which are available


190
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,696
on the CloudKit Dashboard.


191
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:03,466
You can use these charts
to visualize your behavior


192
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:06,686
in the public database or an
aggregate of your behavior


193
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,556
across all users'
private databases.


194
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,086
You can scope these charts
so that you're viewing data


195
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,676
on an hourly, daily,
weekly or monthly basis.


196
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:18,446
And you can choose to view the
entirety of your application


197
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:21,646
or scope these charts down
to a specific operation type.


198
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:24,686
So, let's go and see
what this looks like.


199
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,146
Here we have the
CloudKit Dashboard


200
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,276
which you're probably
familiar with.


201
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,316
And I want to call your
attention to this new UI element


202
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,226
in the lower left,
the Performance tab.


203
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:37,996
When you select the Performance
tab, you now have access


204
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,076
to a series of charts
which gives you information


205
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,306
about how your clients
are behaving.


206
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,326
They fall into two categories.


207
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:47,486
The first is performance charts
and here we surface information


208
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,216
such as the number of
operations per second


209
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,556
and the average size
of your requests.


210
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,696
And again, you can scope this
so that you're visualizing data


211
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,246
in the public or private
database along a variety


212
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:01,986
of timescales and potentially
on a per-operation type basis.


213
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,636
The other type of chart that
we surface is what we call our


214
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:06,406
Correctness chart.


215
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,106
And the one I want to call
attention to is client errors.


216
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:14,216
This tells you what percentage
of requests that you have issued


217
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,046
that have resulted
in a client error.


218
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,916
Now, a client error is
a subset of the errors


219
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,656
that you might receive
from a CKOperation.


220
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:25,406
And it is that subset which we
think your application should be


221
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,916
able to resolve and
take action on.


222
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:30,546
So for example, maybe you
tried to save a record


223
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,626
and there was a conflicting
record change upon the server.


224
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:36,176
Or perhaps you attempted to
fetch changes from a Record Zone


225
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,426
that the server doesn't
know about.


226
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,906
Both of these would be
considered client errors


227
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,016
and would be surfaced
in this chart.


228
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,466
By being able to
visualize your error trends,


229
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,906
we hope that you can
take advantages to find


230
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,226
when your client's, situations


231
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,776
when your clients are seeing
abnormally frequent number


232
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,346
of errors.


233
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:56,776
Now, we've said in the past
that error handling is essential


234
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,216
for a CloudKit-backed
Application.


235
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,736
The difference between
an Application


236
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:02,766
that handles errors
well and an application


237
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,946
that handles errors
poorly is the difference


238
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,346
between a functioning App
and a nonfunctioning App.


239
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:08,766
It's that serious.


240
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,316
It's an integral part in writing
a CloudKit-based Application.


241
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:14,366
So, we hope that you can
use these charts to figure


242
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,876
out situations in which you need


243
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,216
to go examine how your clients
are handling their errors.


244
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:21,696
For more information on
how to handle errors well,


245
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,886
I want to invite you
to tomorrow's talk,


246
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,236
CloudKit Best Practices.


247
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,336
We'll spend some time diving
into proper error handling.


248
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:33,746
Next, I'd like to talk to
you about some improvements


249
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,006
to our APIs, all of which
are new since the last WWDC.


250
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:39,726
And really, there's four that I
want to call your attention to.


251
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,466
Starting with Long-Lived
Operations.


252
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:45,906
Long-Lived Operations
give you a mechanism


253
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,886
by which you don't
have to repeat work


254
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,276
that you've already
done gets the server.


255
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:53,876
So, as it stands now, when your
application goes away, it exits.


256
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:55,916
Any operations that
were outstanding


257
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,526
on behalf of it are torn down.


258
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,406
Even if that operation was
moments away from completing.


259
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:04,296
By making your operations
long-lived,


260
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:07,016
your operations can outlive the
lifetime of your Application.


261
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,816
They will continue running
and CloudKit will continue


262
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:14,016
to cache responses from the
server in a local cache.


263
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,766
When your Application
is next launched,


264
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,006
you've resumed the operation.


265
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,766
And we're just going to go
ahead and feed you those caches


266
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,186
out of our local cache.


267
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:25,636
In many cases, this can
completely eliminate the need


268
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:26,866
for another network round trip.


269
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,506
We're going to talk about
Long-Lived Operations


270
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:32,366
in more detail at tomorrow's
talk, Best Practices, 9 am,


271
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,406
I hope you can join us.


272
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,436
Next I want to touch on
a topic that we've heard


273
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,826
of from our developers
and it has to do


274
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,476
with CKOperation
behavior on bad network.


275
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:44,056
And the picture I want to paint


276
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,076
for you here is we've
got a device.


277
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,216
The device has network
that says it's available


278
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,886
but we're not getting
any traffic going


279
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:50,866
over in either direction.


280
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:53,616
And as a side note, you
can actually go ahead


281
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,096
and replicate the scenario
yourself using the network link


282
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,756
conditioner, a great
developer tool


283
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,106
for replicating behavior
such as this.


284
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,516
Now, a CKOperation is a
subclass of an NS operation.


285
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,636
And as such, as a
QualityOfService property.


286
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:10,016
If your operation is
marked as user interactive


287
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,306
or user initiated, then on a bad
network, we're going to tear it


288
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,586
down after 1 minute and give
you a network timeout error.


289
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,996
If your operation has any of
these other QualityOfServices,


290
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:19,586
we're going to go ahead


291
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,696
and continue attempting
it for up to seven days.


292
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,526
It might not be what
you expected.


293
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:25,786
What's more, if you choose not


294
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,576
to set an explicit
QualityOfService


295
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,886
on your CKOperation, we
will choose one for you


296
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,126
and we choose utility.


297
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,836
So, if you add all
this up, we get a lot


298
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,536
of developer reports saying,
you know, it's been 5 days,


299
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,186
why is my operation
still outstanding.


300
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,736
So, we want to address
this and we're going


301
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,056
to address this with
two new APIs.


302
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:47,276
The first covers network
inactivity and we expose it


303
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,286
as the timeout interval


304
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,636
for request property
on a CKOperation.


305
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:54,146
It defaults to 1 minute
and it's the amount of time


306
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:56,766
that we're willing to wait for
a packet to go over the wire.


307
00:13:57,556 --> 00:13:59,946
If we don't hear any traffic
received or sent in that amount


308
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:02,206
of time, we're going to tear
down your operation to tell you


309
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,166
that the network timed out.


310
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,346
We're also going to expose
an end to end timeout,


311
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,256
and we expose this as
the timeout interval


312
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:11,666
for resource property
on a CKOperation.


313
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,126
This defaults to seven days and
it governs the amount of time


314
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,456
that we're willing to wait for
an entire network round trip


315
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:18,816
from your device to
the service server


316
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,666
and its completion
back to the device.


317
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,806
Now, I want to make note


318
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:25,896
that a CKOperation may issue
multiple network requests


319
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,586
as it's going about its job.


320
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:31,166
So, a CKOperation may take more
time than you expect so long


321
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,936
as you are making
progress in the wire.


322
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:39,336
Next, I want to talk about how
do we efficiently fetch a series


323
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,456
of record changes when
there are many Record Zones


324
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:42,266
up on the server.


325
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,446
As we'll learn when
we get into sharing,


326
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:47,316
your client may see more
Record Zones then you've seen


327
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:47,936
in the past.


328
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,696
So, our answer to this
used to be that you need


329
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,386
to fetch the entire
list of Record Zones


330
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:56,776
from a database using a
CKFetchRecordZonesOperation.


331
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,046
There's a couple
problems with this.


332
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,866
We don't want you to poll
and we don't want to have


333
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,296
to fetch the entire list of
Record Zones down from server.


334
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:06,126
So, we're no longer going to
recommend this for this approach


335
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,536
and we're going to replace
it with two new concepts.


336
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:11,646
The first,
CKDatabaseSubscription.


337
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,766
This is a new subscription type


338
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,926
that will fire whenever
any change happens inside


339
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:16,626
of a database.


340
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,546
Even in a Record Zone that
you haven't learned about yet.


341
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,326
And we're going to couple


342
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,386
that with a
CKFetchDatabaseChanges


343
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:23,906
operation.


344
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,566
This is an operation that allows
you to ask the server for a list


345
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,746
of Record Zones that
have pending changes


346
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:33,116
since some point in
time in the past.


347
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,056
Okay, so now you have a list
of Record Zones that you want


348
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,116
to go fetch changes for.


349
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,776
How are you going to do that?


350
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:41,276
Well, the old way was
that you would issue a


351
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,916
CKFetchRecordChanges operation.


352
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,326
You'd pass in a single Record
Zone and get the changes


353
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:46,346
for that single Record Zone.


354
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:49,366
We don't want you to have
to enumerate, you know,


355
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,036
sequentially through all these
Record Zones so we've gone ahead


356
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,596
and deprecated this
operation outright.


357
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,326
And we've replaced it
with a brand-new operation


358
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,956
with a very similar
sounding name,


359
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,746
the CKFetchRecordZone
changes operation.


360
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:06,376
This is essentially a batch
interface over the old operation


361
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,296
and it gives you the ability
to fetch record changes


362
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,946
across multiple Record Zones
in a single network round trip.


363
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,476
So, let's go ahead
and visualize this.


364
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:18,636
Here we have a database,
several Record Zones,


365
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,496
each Record Zone has
a series of records.


366
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,076
And the client, which
is up-to-date


367
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,386
with all of these changes.


368
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:26,246
Now, along come a
couple of new records.


369
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,966
Your client, by virtue of
having previously saved a


370
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:33,166
CKDatabaseSubscription, will
cause a push to be generated


371
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,296
on the server and
sent to the client.


372
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,916
Next, using a
CKFetchDatabaseChanges


373
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,376
operation, you can ask
the server for a list


374
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,166
of Record Zones that
have pending changes.


375
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,036
In this case, the
first and the third.


376
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,656
Now, armed with that
list of Record Zones,


377
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,306
you can issue a
CKFetchRecordZoneChanges


378
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:54,166
operation requesting all
those records and all


379
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,386
of the change Record Zones in
a single network round trip.


380
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,646
And lastly, I'd like to talk


381
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,786
about how do you
efficiently fetch changes


382
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,455
when there are many
records sitting


383
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:07,935
in a Record Zone
up on the server.


384
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:12,205
If you've used CloudKit
to do this in the past,


385
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,435
then you're familiar with the
moreComing flag, which was set


386
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,576
on a CKFetchRecordChanges
operation to inform you


387
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,496
that not only have we given you
some changes but there are more


388
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:23,195
up on the server that
you should go fetch


389
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,886
with a subsequent
CKFetchRecordChanges operation.


390
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:29,106
Now, there's a couple
problems with this approach.


391
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:32,086
The first is that we've
distributed the logic


392
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:34,486
of check the flag and
issue another operation


393
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,656
to all of our clients.


394
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,516
It's another potential
point of failure.


395
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,866
And secondly, while you're
determining that you need


396
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:43,896
to fetch and cue a new operation
and doing that in cueing.


397
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,646
CloudKit is sitting around idle.


398
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:49,426
We want to address both of those
so we took advantage of the fact


399
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,106
that we made a brand-new
operation,


400
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:54,206
CKFetchRecordChanges
operation, to change this model.


401
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,256
Instead of us telling you


402
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:57,756
when there are more
changes available,


403
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,606
you tell us what your
intention is via the new


404
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,676
fetchAllChanges property.


405
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:07,296
When this is set to true, then
CloudKit will fetch a batch


406
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,476
of changes from the server,
hand them to your client,


407
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,256
and then immediately
go back to the server


408
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,526
for the next batch of changes.


409
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,366
This allows us to keep
the pipeline full,


410
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,966
pulling network data over the
network while you're processing.


411
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:21,826
Now, we think that this is going
to be such a common behavior


412
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,086
that we've gone ahead and we've
made this the default behavior


413
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,026
for this new class.


414
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:29,276
So, new CKFetchRecordZoneChanges
operations


415
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,776
by default will fetch
the entirety of records


416
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,336
down from a particular
Record Zone.


417
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:39,286
As you might imagine, if you've
got a large Record Zone, say,


418
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,546
your user's iCloud Photo
Library up on the server,


419
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:45,236
this means that the subsequent
operation to fetch all records


420
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:46,156
in the Record Zone is going


421
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,486
to take a very long
time to complete.


422
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:50,966
We want to make sure that
you are resilient in the face


423
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,716
of operations that
fail part way through.


424
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,006
We don't want to have to go
ahead and re-download batches


425
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,276
that we've already
fetched from the server.


426
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,506
So, we've added a new
callback on this new class.


427
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,686
RecordZoneChangeTokens
UpdatedBlock.


428
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,876
And after we hand you a batch of
changes, we're going to go ahead


429
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:08,146
and tell you about an
updated server change token.


430
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,456
And your code is going
to be responsible


431
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,426
for doing two different things.


432
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,216
First, you're going to go ahead


433
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:16,246
and commit all the
per record changes


434
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:17,976
that you've received
from the server.


435
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:21,496
And secondly, you're going to go
ahead and you're going to cache


436
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,566
that server change token.


437
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:25,966
If the operation fails at
some point in the future,


438
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,106
you can issue a brand-new
CKFetchRecordZoneChanges


439
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:32,536
operation, pass in this locally
cached server change token


440
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,146
and essentially pick back
up where you left off.


441
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,316
No need to re-download
the batches of changes


442
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,896
that you've already
downloaded from the server.


443
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:43,126
And so these are just 4 of the
API improvements that we hope


444
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:45,956
that you can take advantage of
as you write applications backed


445
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,676
by iCloud, backed by CloudKit.


446
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,626
And with that, I'd like to
go ahead and switch gears


447
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:53,176
and invite up Jacob Farkas to
walk us through the sharing UI.


448
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:59,976le
[ Applause ]


449
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:01,496
>> Thanks Paul.


450
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:05,096
My name is Jacob Farkas
and I'm an engineer


451
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,076
on the CloudKit team.


452
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:07,586
And today I'm going
to talk to you


453
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:10,666
about how you can add CloudKit
sharing UI to your application


454
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,756
by only writing a
couple of lines of code.


455
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:18,476
We've introduced a new class
in CloudKit called CKShare.


456
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,896
It's a subclass of CKRecord
and it's responsible


457
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,056
for storing two important
pieces of information.


458
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,556
One, what is shared, and two,


459
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,266
what that record is
being shared with.


460
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,136
So, let's look at
an example of this.


461
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,836
We've got our private database
here and we have a note


462
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,226
in the private database
that we'd like to share.


463
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,606
To do that, we're going
to create the CKShare


464
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:46,266
and initialize it using
that record as the record.


465
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,626
You always need to create
a Share with a root record


466
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,736
so there's always
something in the Share.


467
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:56,556
Next, we're going to save
that Share and the root record


468
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,986
to the server at the same time.


469
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,066
You want to do that because
there's a new property


470
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,196
on CKRecord that's a reference


471
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,366
to the Share that
we're creating.


472
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,516
By saving the root record and
the Share at the same time,


473
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:13,866
that reference will be set to
the share you just created.


474
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:17,236
So, now we've defined what
we want to share but we need


475
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,156
to define who we want
to share that with.


476
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,076
To do that, we've created a
new lookup service in CloudKit.


477
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:28,776
This lookup service takes a
email address and it turns it


478
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,786
into a CKShare participant.


479
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:33,376
You can set the Share
participant on the Share,


480
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,926
save that Share to
the server and now


481
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:40,156
that person's iCloud account
has access to the Share.


482
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,286
We also support looking
up users via phone numbers


483
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:48,176
or CloudKit user record IDs.


484
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:51,526
Now, we want to let users
have control over what appears


485
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:53,906
in their shared database so
we don't want to these records


486
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:55,136
to just instantly appear.


487
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,086
The user should have control so
they should be able to accept


488
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,206
that Share and join it.


489
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:03,556
But that means we need a way
of telling that other user


490
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,586
that we've made a share
for them and invited them


491
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:06,586
and that they need to join it.


492
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:09,196
And we do that via URLs.


493
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,216
Every share has a URL which
uniquely identifies it.


494
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:19,376
If the user taps on this URL in
iOS or clicks on it in macOS,


495
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:21,726
we're going to show
the accept UI.


496
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:24,286
We're going to ask them if
they want to join the Share.


497
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:27,116
And if they do, they'll
be taken to the App


498
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:28,976
and shown the items
in that Share.


499
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:33,286
The great thing about a
URL is that if this user is


500
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,436
on an older platform
or on a platform


501
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:36,606
that doesn't support sharing,


502
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:38,736
this will take them
to iCloud.com.


503
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,776
And we can show them
information about the Share


504
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,516
and tell them how they can
accept it and join the Share.


505
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:49,766
So, let's put this URL into
an email and send it off


506
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:51,336
to the other participant
we invited.


507
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:56,366
They're going to receive the
email, click on it and now


508
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:59,046
in their Shared Database they
see the Share and the Note


509
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,496
that we created and
shared with them.


510
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:05,756
The great thing here is that the
Share Database is actually just


511
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:08,016
a view into the owner's
private database.


512
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:11,566
So, if this other user has
the right access to the Share,


513
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,286
if they update that
Note, we're going to see


514
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,836
that same change happen
in our private database.


515
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:20,246
So, let's take a look at what
this looks like in the UI.


516
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:31,806
All right, we've got Notes
here and we've added sharing


517
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:35,016
to Notes in macOS X Sierra.


518
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:37,906
By using the same
CloudKit sharing APIs


519
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:39,986
that we're making available
to all of you today.


520
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,986
So, you'll see that there's
a new Share Add Person button


521
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:44,326
up here.


522
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,286
And if we tap on that,
we get a new sheet


523
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,696
that lets us choose how
we want to share that URL.


524
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:56,586
When we hit Share, the system
UI is calling into Notes


525
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:59,916
and telling Notes that it
needs to save that Share


526
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,376
and the root record
to the server.


527
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:05,406
Once it's done that, the system
UI shows a Mail Compose window.


528
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,146
We can invite the other user.


529
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:09,286
We hit Send.


530
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,846
And the system UI is actually
saving that Share to the server,


531
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:14,196
looking up the participants


532
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,606
and sending the email
off to the other user.


533
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:20,766
So, if we switch over to our
iPad here with the other user,


534
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,296
we see the email we just sent.


535
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:24,686
We can tap on that URL.


536
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:27,626
And we'll be asked if we
want to join the Share.


537
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,506
When we do that, we're
launched right into Notes.


538
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,626
The Share shows up, the Note
downloads and now we're sharing


539
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:35,726
that Note with the other user.


540
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,716
If I make changes on the
Note from the originator,


541
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:43,756
let's say I check off avocados
on the list and I add limes


542
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:44,756
as something else to pick up.


543
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,286
We'll see those happen in the
note that's being shared to us.


544
00:24:56,276 --> 00:25:00,976
So, let's look at
the code behind that.


545
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:02,716
You're probably all familiar


546
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:05,656
with the CloudKit framework
already which is where CKRecord


547
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,516
and the new CKShare object live.


548
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:10,986
If you want to use this new
system sharing UI, you're going


549
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:15,936
to find that on macOS in
AppKit and in iOS on UIKit.


550
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:23,636
We'll start by looking
at the iOS sharing API.


551
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:27,086
Before we create a Share,
before we bring up the UI,


552
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:28,416
we need to create
a Share of course.


553
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,536
So, we'll create a Share
here with our record.


554
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:34,986
We will set a couple properties
to let the UI show that Share,


555
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,416
title and a thumbnail.


556
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:41,536
And then we move on
to creating a cloud,


557
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,036
a UI cloud-sharing controller.


558
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:46,366
We initialize that with
the Share we just made


559
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:48,026
and we pass it a
preparation handler.


560
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,266
This preparation handler
is going to be called


561
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,746
when it's time to
save that share


562
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:53,836
in the record to the server.


563
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:57,626
So, our handler here will create
a CKModifyRecords operation.


564
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:01,406
Save the record and Share to
the server and when it's done,


565
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,096
it will call the
completion handler.


566
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:08,816
Next, we might want
to set some properties


567
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,726
on this UI cloud
sharing controller.


568
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:14,576
One of the properties we can set
it is the available permissions.


569
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:17,826
We can say whether we want that
Share to be publicly shared only


570
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,846
or maybe we only want
to give the participants


571
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:20,756
read/write permissions.


572
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,016
We also want to set the present,


573
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:27,636
presentation controller source
view so that the pop-up appears


574
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:30,236
in the same place as the button
that we tapped to add people.


575
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:33,326
We'll want to set
ourself as a delegate


576
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,716
so that we get callbacks about
what's happening in the UI.


577
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,256
And finally we call Present.


578
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,536
And when we do that, we're
going to get a pop-up


579
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:43,336
that looks something like this.


580
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,766
Now, if you've already saved
the Share of the server,


581
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:49,106
you can call UI cloud sharing
control with just the Share.


582
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,936
And it will present a
list of invited users


583
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,106
and let them manage
the users on the Share


584
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:55,786
and stop sharing if they'd like.


585
00:26:55,986 --> 00:27:01,286
Everything is taken care of
for you by the system UI.


586
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:05,176
The macOS sharing API is really
similar so we're just going


587
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,156
to go very quickly and
highlight the differences here.


588
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:11,416
First off, you create
an NSItem provider


589
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:14,066
and you register your
CloudKit Share with that.


590
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,876
This handler looks the
same as what we saw before.


591
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:18,786
You save the Share in
the record to the server


592
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,026
and when you're done, you
call the completion handler.


593
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:25,486
Next, you're going to
create an NSSharingService.


594
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,236
That sharing service is
going to have a delegate


595
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:30,796
that you set yourself
and you call perform


596
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,976
with the NSItem provider
that you created earlier.


597
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:39,986
Finally, NSSharingService
is callback based.


598
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:43,436
So, if you want to set options
on what the share can do,


599
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,526
you'll do that with callback
like options for Share.


600
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:52,106
On macOS, the Share create
UI will look like this.


601
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,656
And if you want to
modify the participants


602
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:58,406
on a Share, it'll
look like this.


603
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:02,456
Next, if a user accepts a
Share for your Application,


604
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,556
your Application is
going to get launched


605
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:07,816
and it'll receive this callback
Application user Accepted


606
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:08,606
CloudKit Share.


607
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:11,936
That callback will contain
Share metadata that'll tell you


608
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:13,516
about the Share in
the root record


609
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:14,716
that the user just accepted.


610
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,136
It looks really similar
on iOS with the exception


611
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,826
of using UIApplication
instead of NSApplication.


612
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:25,456
And finally, you need
to tell the system


613
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,706
that your Application
supports CloudKit sharing.


614
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,686
And you do this via the
CKSharingSupported key


615
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:31,746
in your info P list.


616
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,566
We're also happy to announce


617
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,346
that we've added
full sharing support


618
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:40,436
to our CloudKit JavaScript
library so if you're on the web,


619
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:44,656
you can create Shares, accept
them and we've given you some UI


620
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,186
that you can use to
manage the Share.


621
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:50,736
You can try this all out right
now in the CloudKit catalog.


622
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:54,316
So, I'm going to hand things off
now to my colleague, Vanessa,


623
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,776
who is going to tell
you a little bit more


624
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,746
about sharing in depth.


625
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,796le
[ Applause ]


626
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,796
[ Applause ]


627
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:02,966
>> Thank you, Jacob.


628
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:05,606
Hi. And good afternoon.


629
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:08,656
My name is Vanessa Hong
and I'm an engineer


630
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:09,956
on the CloudKit server team.


631
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:14,346
So, today we will deep dive
into sharing by looking


632
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:15,766
at some common use cases.


633
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:20,066
We'll start with the
data that's being shared


634
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:22,016
and then we'll go
step-by-step all the way


635
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,186
down into the internals
of the CKShare object.


636
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,846
Then I'll talk about how you
can call our sharing APIs


637
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,956
if you want to create
your own custom UI.


638
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,676
And then finally we'll close
it out with some special notes.


639
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,216
So, let's get started.


640
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:40,686
Jacob showed how to
Share a single record.


641
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:44,206
But the item the owner wants


642
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,716
to share may not
be a single record.


643
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:47,976
It may consist of many records.


644
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,866
Possibly already
linked via CKReferences.


645
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,656
And your application
may want a participant


646
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,686
to see only a subset
of these records.


647
00:29:57,936 --> 00:29:59,656
This is why we introduced
a new field


648
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:02,556
on the CKRecord called
the Parent Reference.


649
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:06,446
Set the Parent Reference on
any records that you wish


650
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,396
to be included in
the shared hierarchy.


651
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,006
And you can set this up
even before the user decides


652
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:12,436
to share.


653
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:17,256
When the user does share,


654
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:19,956
you will create the CKShare
only with the root record.


655
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:22,256
Then, all of the all
the descendent records


656
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:25,506
that are linked to the root
record via the Parent Reference


657
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:28,206
are automatically included
in the shared hierarchy.


658
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:31,496
So, let's see what this looks
like in the shared database.


659
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:36,216
A shared database is only a view


660
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,936
into the owner's
private database.


661
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,816
So, it doesn't contain
any physical records.


662
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:44,436
When a participant
accepts a Share,


663
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:47,396
they only see what
is shared to them.


664
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,076
So, they see the
shared hierarchy.


665
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:54,156
This means there's no two
copies of these records.


666
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,096
There's only one copy
and that copy lives


667
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:57,416
in the owner's private DB.


668
00:30:57,726 --> 00:31:02,226
So, this means the owner and all
the participants are interacting


669
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,846
with the same set of records.


670
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:07,726
This kind of contention may
end up causing conflicts.


671
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,826
To learn how to deal with
conflicts, I'd like to refer you


672
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:15,966
to a past WWDC talk called
Advanced CloudKit from 2014.


673
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:20,376
Now, a read/write
participant can modify,


674
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:22,446
remove and add records.


675
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:26,156
But we don't want
them to be able


676
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:30,196
to add just anything they
want into somebody else's DB.


677
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:33,026
For instance, they cannot
add a random root record.


678
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:37,636
They also cannot add a record
without a Parent Reference,


679
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:40,476
even if it's somehow linked
to the shared hierarchy.


680
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:47,236
So, the correct way to add a new
record via the shared database


681
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:52,266
is to set a Parent Reference and
link it to the shared hierarchy.


682
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:56,486
So, even though you're
adding a new record


683
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:59,756
for the participant via
the shared database,


684
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:03,006
that new record lives in
the owner's private DB.


685
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,886
So, what this means is
all records that are added


686
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:09,676
by the participant are counted
against the owner's quota.


687
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:12,456
So, the producement's
quota is not affected


688
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:17,296
and your developer
quota is not affected.


689
00:32:17,296 --> 00:32:19,616
The owner's private
database is the only place


690
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:22,076
that we store these records
so we can count them only


691
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,006
against the owner's quota.


692
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:26,146
And that's how you
share multiple records.


693
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:30,726
Let's take a closer look
at the shared database.


694
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:37,736
So, here we have two Shares
from two different owners


695
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,416
but the Shares have
the same name,


696
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:40,886
so how do you tell
the difference?


697
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:45,066
Well, we glossed over a very
important detail which is


698
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:48,146
that all records in
CloudKit live in Zones.


699
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:52,706
And a Zone is identified
by that CKRecord Zone ID.


700
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,926
The Zone name is the name of
the custom Zone that you created


701
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,576
in the owner's private DB.


702
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:03,806
An owner name is the
owner's user record name.


703
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:07,246
So, in our example, the two
Zones have the same name


704
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,206
but different owners.


705
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:11,366
So, let's say the first
owner shares something else


706
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:12,506
but in a different Zone.


707
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,726
So when you call the
FetchDatabaseChanges API,


708
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:17,616
you will see this
new zone appear.


709
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:20,696
And then when you call
FetchRecordZoneChanges,


710
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,126
you'll see the new
record and the Share.


711
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,536
Now, let's say the second
owner shares something else


712
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:28,736
but in the existing Zone.


713
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:32,216
Well, this Zone already exists
so we won't create a new one.


714
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:33,946
We'll just reuse it.


715
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,046
When you call the
FetchChanges APIs, you will see


716
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:38,916
that this Zone has changed and
that there are new records.


717
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:41,996
And that is our shared database.


718
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:45,316
So, let's take this
one level down and look


719
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:46,616
at the CKShare object.


720
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,056
So, before the owner
can create a Share,


721
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:53,446
they must do something to Share.


722
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:56,326
So, the records describe
what to Share.


723
00:33:56,996 --> 00:34:01,196
And the CKShare describes how
those records should be shared.


724
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:05,436
So, we're going to be
looking at the how.


725
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:09,255
So, as Jacob mentioned,
every CKShare is a CKRecord


726
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,856
but it has some additional
properties.


727
00:34:11,906 --> 00:34:14,656
And we've been looking at
how these properties apply


728
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,116
to the lifecycle of a Share.


729
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:17,835
So, we're going to
start from the beginning


730
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:19,866
and the owner will
create a Share.


731
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:24,606
And the owner has to decide
what is the public permission


732
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:25,096
for the Share.


733
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:27,726
So, in this case the owner
says it should be none,


734
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,795
because he wants to
invite participants.


735
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:32,456
And let's say he
invites two participants.


736
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:35,335
Their status is automatically
invited.


737
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:38,286
And then the owner
decides what permission


738
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,636
to give to each participant.


739
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:42,946
Then, the owner saves the Share


740
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:45,065
and then he gets a
URL for the Share.


741
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:47,696
So, there are two
things happening here.


742
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,485
One is that the Share
has a state.


743
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:54,376
And the State says only these
two participants can accept


744
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:54,646
the Share.


745
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,046
The owner is the one with the
URL and it is his responsibility


746
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,726
to tell people about this URL.


747
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:04,026
So, even if he tells 100
people about this URL,


748
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,786
only these two participants
can accept the Share.


749
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,716
So, when a participant
accepts the Share,


750
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:11,286
they accept via the URL.


751
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:15,616
And after that accept,


752
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:18,276
their acceptance
status becomes accepted.


753
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,266
And then the permission


754
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:22,296
in the Share is exactly
what the owner gave them.


755
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:25,696
So, now let's say
the owner wants


756
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,096
to create a more open share.


757
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,616
So, let's start over.


758
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:36,036
The owner sets up a
Share and then he decides


759
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,766
that the public permission
should be readOnly


760
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:38,246
or read/write.


761
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,116
He doesn't add any participants.


762
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:42,156
He just saves the Share.


763
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:44,846
And then he gets a
URL for the share.


764
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,396
So, there's still
two things happening.


765
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:49,386
One is that the Share
has a state


766
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:51,826
and it says anyone can join.


767
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,866
And the owner has a URL.


768
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:57,006
And it's his responsibility
to tell people about it.


769
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,796
So, if he tells 100 people,
then all 100 people can join.


770
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:04,606
So, when they join, they
would have to join via the URL


771
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,546
and then that participant
appears


772
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:08,576
in the Share and accepted state.


773
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,486
Their permission is inherited


774
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,276
from the Share's
public permission field.


775
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:17,956
And that's how you set up the
Share and accept the Share.


776
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:22,326
So, the next phase of
the Share's lifecycle is


777
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,366
when a participant leaves.


778
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:27,736
And a participant
can leave a Share


779
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:32,406
by deleting the CKShare
object from their shared DB.


780
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:36,826
This will also remove the shared
records from their shared DB.


781
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:39,446
So, to be clear, the
CKShare still exists.


782
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:42,146
It exists in the
owner's private DB.


783
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:45,376
It's just that this
participant no longer is


784
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,756
in the Share in accepted state.


785
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:51,736
And the owner has full
power over his Share


786
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:54,246
so he can remove
anybody he wants.


787
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,466
Let's say he wants
to remove everybody.


788
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:01,886
He would do that by
deleting the CKShared object


789
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,006
from his private database.


790
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:05,596
This will also remove
the pointer


791
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:06,826
from the root record
to the Share.


792
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:12,496
And now the owner is back in the
initial state of being unshared.


793
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:18,916
So, let's move on and talk about
the CKShareParticipant object.


794
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:21,696
So, if you've seen this object
before in the lifecycle,


795
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,886
you saw the acceptance
status and the permission.


796
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,476
But now let's look at
the user identity field.


797
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:28,986
This has a look up info.


798
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:32,486
And the look up info is how
this participant was invited


799
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:33,026
to the share.


800
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:36,916
So, it will have their email,
phone or user record ID.


801
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:40,186
And the name components
are the first and last name


802
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,476
and this is populated with
when the participant accepts


803
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,056
the Share.


804
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,396
Every CKShareParticipant is
mapped to an iCloud account.


805
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,986
So, let's say the owner invites
4 participants and we were able


806
00:37:53,986 --> 00:37:58,136
to find iCloud accounts for
the first two but we couldn't


807
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,386
for participant 3 and 4.


808
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,076
This is perfectly okay.


809
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:04,186
CloudKit will create a
temporary placeholder


810
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:05,476
for participant 3 and 4.


811
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:09,306
And the only people who can
accept as participants 3


812
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:11,506
and 4 are the ones who can prove


813
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,666
that they owned the email
address or phone number


814
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:15,456
that the owner invited
them with.


815
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,586
This is called the
verification flow.


816
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:21,626
This will link the email
or phone to their account


817
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,286
so that they never have to go


818
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:24,646
through the verification
flow again.


819
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:29,396
And that's all the objects
that we have in sharing.


820
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:33,166
So, now let's move on and
talk about sharing APIs.


821
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:36,746
So, if you want to
create your own custom UI,


822
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,206
you can call our APIs.


823
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:40,126
And there are two
things that you can do.


824
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:42,146
So, on the behalf of the owner,


825
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:43,936
you can help them
set up the Share.


826
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,036
On behalf of the participant,


827
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,776
you can help them
accept the Share.


828
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:51,996
On watchOS and tvOS, there's
no built-in system UI.


829
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:56,176
So, you can ask your user to go
to a different platform to set


830
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,476
up a Share and accept the Share.


831
00:38:57,866 --> 00:39:01,276
And then the Share data is
available across all platforms.


832
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:05,096
Alternatively, you can
just call our sharing APIs.


833
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,346
And this is how you do it.


834
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:12,426
On behalf of the owner, you
can help them add participants.


835
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:16,766
You would have to look up by
email, phone or user record ID


836
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:21,606
and then translate that to
a CKShareParticipant object.


837
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:23,836
Once you have the
CKShareParticipant object,


838
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,326
add those to the share.


839
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:30,146
And then call CKModifyRecords
operation to save the Share.


840
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:34,146
Now your application
has a URL for the share.


841
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:38,516
And it is up to you, the
application or the owner,


842
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,926
to tell people about the URL.


843
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:43,376
When a participant
accepts a Share,


844
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:44,916
we always start with the URL.


845
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:50,576
You first have to convert the
URL to CKShareMetadata object


846
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:53,196
and then pass that
metadata object


847
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:55,096
to the CKAcceptShares operation.


848
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:59,466
Now, the participant will show
up in a Share in accepted state.


849
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:04,196
Now, there are some
limitations to the accepted API.


850
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:07,576
For privacy reasons,
we cannot return


851
00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:08,936
to you their name components.


852
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,356
And the verification
flow is not available.


853
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,106
So, if you get this error


854
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:16,656
or if it has iCloud
account Boolean is false,


855
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,306
then you can ask your user to
open up the URL themselves.


856
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:24,656
This will trigger the system
or the web to take them


857
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:25,756
through the verification flow.


858
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:29,376
And that's our sharing APIs.


859
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:32,616
So, now let's talk
about your users.


860
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:40,836
A user of your application can
invite anyone they want via any


861
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,556
email or any phone number.


862
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,496
Now, what this means is
the potential audience


863
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:48,636
for your application
is much larger


864
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:49,886
than your current user base.


865
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:53,626
So, these MIT's may not
have installed the latest


866
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:54,426
operating system.


867
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:56,286
They might not even
own an Apple product.


868
00:40:56,356 --> 00:41:01,276
So, when they click on the
URL, we take them to the web.


869
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:04,316
And in the example for Notes,
this is what they'll see.


870
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:06,756
They will be asked
to join a Share,


871
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:09,426
after which they'll
see the shared Note.


872
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:12,866
And they can interact
with this Note just


873
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:13,796
like they would on a device.


874
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,336
But this is the Notes
Web Application


875
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,926
that lives on iCloud.com.


876
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:21,026
What about your Application?


877
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:24,856
Well, by default, your users
will see something like this.


878
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:27,416
It has your App icon
and it asks your user


879
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,896
to go on the latest device.


880
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:32,436
Which is not the
ideal user experience.


881
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:35,226
So, I do have some
good news for you.


882
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,376
You can go to your
CloudKit Dashboard


883
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,446
and configure a fallback URL.


884
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:45,326
So, when an invitee clicks on
a URL that is shared to them,


885
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,816
we redirect them to
your fallback URL.


886
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:52,676
We'll append the token
that is from the unique URL


887
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,926
for the Share so that you
can immediately take them


888
00:41:56,056 --> 00:42:00,216
to accept the Share and then
show them the shared data.


889
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,876
Now, I hope you're excited
to get started on sharing.


890
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:05,366
There is just one last
thing that you need to know.


891
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:09,486
A CKShare is of this
new record type


892
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:12,346
and this record type
behaves just


893
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,816
like any other record
type in CloudKit.


894
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,556
You can create custom
fields on it.


895
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:17,456
You can run queries.


896
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:22,246
You also have the first created
in the development environment.


897
00:42:22,986 --> 00:42:27,746
And the easiest way to create
it is just log in as a user


898
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,556
in your dev environment
and share something


899
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:31,146
from your private database.


900
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,516
This will trigger the
creation of the record type.


901
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,676
And then go to your
CloudKit Dashboard


902
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:38,106
and deploy your scheme
into production.


903
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:41,306
If you don't do this, then users


904
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:43,386
in the production
environment may get errors


905
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:44,166
when they create the Share


906
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:46,766
because the record
type doesn't exist yet.


907
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,496
And that wraps it up.


908
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:54,256
So, you learned today that
CloudKit is available on all


909
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:57,406
of our platforms including
watchOS and is available


910
00:42:57,406 --> 00:43:00,896
on the web via CloudKit JS.


911
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:05,296
Telemetry is available on
our CloudKit Dashboard.


912
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,266
It's a great way to visualize
your application's behavior


913
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,636
including error trends.


914
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:14,016
There are many API improvements
including Long-Lived Operations,


915
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:17,856
[inaudible] and the
new fetch changes APIs.


916
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:20,986
And now you know all about
our new feature, sharing.


917
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:24,716
You've seen this system
UI and you know how


918
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:28,466
to create your own custom UI
by calling our sharing APIs.


919
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:29,796
And you've seen all the
objects that we used


920
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,656
in sharing including
the sharers lifecycle.


921
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,936
And I bet you will go back and
configure those fallback URLs.


922
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:40,716
So, I want to thank you for
sharing this experience with us.


923
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:45,356
I want to draw your attention
to CloudKit Best Practices.


924
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,746
It's tomorrow at 9 AM.


925
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:49,356
It's a great session on how to
use CloudKit more effectively.


926
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,926
Thank you and enjoy the rest
of your WWDC conference.


927
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:57,000
