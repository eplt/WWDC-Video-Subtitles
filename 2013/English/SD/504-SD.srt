00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,496
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:11,216
>> My name is Daniel Kurtz.


3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,946
I'm an iOS engineer on the
Game Center team here at Apple.


4
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:15,976
And I'm here to talk
to you today


5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:17,486
about what's new in Game Center.


6
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,706
So before we really get into
it, let's do a quick recap


7
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,196
of what Game Center actually is.


8
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:27,566
Game Center is a gaming platform
which allows the players


9
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,816
of your games, be they
single player or multiplayer,


10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,606
to be able to interact with each
other by tracking their scores


11
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,386
and achievements that they'd
been earning in your game,


12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,736
sending challenges to
their friends in order


13
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,326
to beat those scores
and achievements.


14
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,366
And then going even further
with the multiplayer support,


15
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,696
we have hosted turn-based gaming
within the game kit framework,


16
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,406
as well as real-time
multiplayer matchmaking.


17
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,636
Now, Game Center has been
incredibly successful.


18
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,176
You might have heard the
other day that we have


19
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:57,036
over 240 million
players in Game Center,


20
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,126
and they're playing games both


21
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,896
on their iOS devices
as well as on OS X.


22
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:06,556
So we've-- when I
asked you what's new


23
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,636
in Game Center this year,
perhaps the first thing


24
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,736
that comes to mind
is our brand new UI


25
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,636
for our Game Center
app on iPhone.


26
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,536
And we're very happy
about this UI.


27
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,196
We think it's very
exciting and fun.


28
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,286
But we're not stopping here.


29
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,936
We've got a lot of things going


30
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:24,046
on under the covers new
this year for Game Center


31
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:27,176
that you can take advantage
of within your game in order


32
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,046
to make it even further
integrated


33
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,306
and social with your players.


34
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:34,006
So today, we've got a
large grab back of topics


35
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,016
that we're going to talk about.


36
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:39,066
First up is the Game
Center in-game experience


37
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,746
with the GK Game
Center view controller.


38
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,346
We also have a lot of new
changes regarding leaderboards


39
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:46,606
and scores, Leaderboard Sets,


40
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,786
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,


41
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:50,746
a new type of leaderboard
that allows you


42
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:51,946
to track scores in a new way.


43
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,636
Also, because we're talking
so much about scores today,


44
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,546
we have improved
security measures


45
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,566
to help you limit
cheating within your game.


46
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:02,896
And building on top of both
scores and achievements,


47
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:04,816
we've improved challenges
even further


48
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,606
to make it more immersive
for your players.


49
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,765
And then, finally,
last but not the least,


50
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,076
we're going to round
it out of talking


51
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:16,856
about how you can take advantage
of handling local player events


52
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,886
and some fundamental API
changes that we've done


53
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,026
with how you can respond
to events relevant


54
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,326
to the local player
of your game.


55
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,776
So let's get right into it.


56
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,466
Let's talk about the Game
Center in-game experience.


57
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:32,596
And you probably all already
know this game, perhaps,


58
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:34,626
it's the in-game menu
for Temple Run 2.


59
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,346
And on that right
column in the middle row,


60
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:38,436
it's the leaderboards button.


61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,066
Now, today, if you were
to pull out your iPhone


62
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,516
and play this game and tap
that leaderboard button,


63
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,016
up would pop the GK Game
Center view controller,


64
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,516
giving you the ability to take a
look at your leaderboard scores,


65
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,496
your achievements, perhaps
new challenges you've earned.


66
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:55,366
In iOS 7, that same
thing still happens


67
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,106
and we've updated the look,


68
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,846
the UI of the GK Game
Center view controller


69
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,306
in a very radical way.


70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,716
We feel that this makes
it much more ingrained,


71
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,636
much more embedded
within Temple Run 2.


72
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,996
As you can see, Temple
Run 2's screen still shows


73
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:11,916
through in the background.


74
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,936
However, the same information is
still available to your players.


75
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,776
You still have the same list
of leaderboards, can still look


76
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,576
at the achievements that
your players have earned


77
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,506
or currently endeavoring
to earn,


78
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,166
and the challenges they've
gotten from their friends,


79
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,196
as well as the ability to rate
the game within the App Store


80
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,376
up in the top left or like the
game on Facebook if they wish.


81
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,836
So programmatically,
nothing has really changed


82
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,686
as to how you're going


83
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,926
to present the GK Game
Center view controller.


84
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:43,236
It's the same exact API
that you'd be using before


85
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,336
with a little bit of a wrinkle


86
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,276
when you're thinking
about performance.


87
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,736
So let's take a look
at some code.


88
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,886
Let's say that you have
a target action setup


89
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:55,666
for that leaderboard button in
your game and you want to hear


90
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,856
when that button is tapped


91
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:58,716
to show the Game
Center view controller.


92
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,846
Well, in your target
action method,


93
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,406
the first thing you're going to
do is grab the shared instance


94
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,006
for the GK Game Center
view controller,


95
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,596
setting up the delegate to cells


96
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,186
so that you can dismiss
it appropriately,


97
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,176
set up your view state


98
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,226
to whatever appropriate initial
view state you wish to show.


99
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,516
And here's a little
bit of a wrinkle,


100
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,036
the throttle rendering call.


101
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,586
We'll get into that
in just a moment.


102
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,755
And then, finally, you're going


103
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,816
to present the view
controller just like you would


104
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,856
with any other UI view
controller within you game.


105
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:29,196
Now that throttle rendering call
that I'm talking about, right?


106
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,886
As I mentioned, the GK
Game Center view controller


107
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,516
with iOS 7 is partially
transparent.


108
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,266
Moreover, it's also
doing some blurring


109
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,406
and other heavy compositing
on the GPU.


110
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:44,036
So in order to make this
present as smoothly as possible


111
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,346
so that players can get in
and out of the menu and back


112
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,706
to playing your game,
you don't really need


113
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,056
to be running graphics at 60
frames per second and you're


114
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:53,766
about to push this
view controller over.


115
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,906
So you can step back in
the gas pedal a little bit


116
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:58,646
and let the view
controller present,


117
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,476
dismiss when you need to,
and get right back to it.


118
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,406
So really, that's
all that's changed


119
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:05,996
with the GK Game
Center view controller.


120
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:11,166
It's really just the exact
same API with a brand new look


121
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,546
that we feel really makes it


122
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,196
that much more ingrained
within your game.


123
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:19,716
So let's move on to the
next new topic of today.


124
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,636
Leaderboard Sets.


125
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,176
This is something we're
very excited about.


126
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:29,116
Today, on-- in iOS 6 device
or on OS X Mountain Lion,


127
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,286
your game currently has
at most 25 leaderboards


128
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,426
that it can define and
use on Game Center.


129
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,026
Now, I'm happy to tell you


130
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:40,406
that we have increased
this maximum limit


131
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,156
to 100 leaderboards.


132
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:45,436
You can have at most 100
leaderboards in a flat list


133
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,506
that your game can
use in Game Center.


134
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,506
And we're not stopping there.


135
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,876
With this new feature that
we have, Leaderboard Sets,


136
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:55,776
we're increasing actually
the maximum amount


137
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,426
of leaderboards you can use
within your game twentyfold


138
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,536
to 500 maximum leaderboards.


139
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,346
And now, with Leaderboard Sets,


140
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,736
we're introducing an
organizational hierarchy,


141
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:08,046
a structure that you can
impose on these leaderboards.


142
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,266
You can think of Leaderboard
Sets as a tagging architecture


143
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,226
where a single leaderboard can
belong to many different sets,


144
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:17,406
and likewise, a single
set can contain many


145
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:18,456
different leaderboards.


146
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,646
Then you have at most
100 sets that you can use


147
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,126
within your game and at
most 100 leaderboards


148
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,186
that you can put
in a single set.


149
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,016
So why are we asking you


150
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:32,396
to use Leaderboard Sets before
you can actually unlock the full


151
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,616
500 leaderboards for
use within your game?


152
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,526
It actually comes down
to usability issue.


153
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,006
Let's say you've got a Water
Planet group of stages, right?


154
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,336
And also, for this
group of stages,


155
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,796
you have a boss level
at the end.


156
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,936
And maybe you've also
got different levels


157
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,586
of difficulty-- easy,
medium, hard.


158
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:52,036
So one possible leaderboard


159
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,296
that your game has is the
Water Planet Boss Level


160
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,236
Medium leaderboard.


161
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:58,926
You, being the endeavoring game
developer that you are, however,


162
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:02,106
also have 499 other leaderboards


163
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:03,486
that you've made
within your game.


164
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,556
So when a player wants to
go and checkout their score


165
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,696
on the Water Planet Boss
Level Medium leaderboard,


166
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,786
either within your game,
the Game Center application,


167
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,776
or the GK Game Center
view controller,


168
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:17,426
how are they supposed to find
this leaderboard amongst all


169
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,636
500 leaderboards?


170
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,036
It really comes down to a needle
in a haystack problem, right?


171
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:27,086
So what sets allow us to
do is to organize this


172
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:30,186
into meaningful groups of
data to make it a lot easier


173
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,226
for players to parse


174
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,656
when they're looking
through your game.


175
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:36,366
Here's an example from the GK
Game Center view controller


176
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,606
for this game, where when the
player taps the leaderboard


177
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:43,156
segment, the first thing that
they are shown is the list


178
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,816
of Leaderboard Sets
within the game.


179
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:49,006
Then if we were to tap that
Water Planet set up at the top,


180
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,746
the very next screen would
show all the leaderboards


181
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,066
that are contained within
the Water Planet set.


182
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,476
Pretty straightforward, right?


183
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:02,126
So let's consider how we
could actually put this single


184
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,206
leaderboard into various sets


185
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:07,386
and how we can start imposing
some order to the chaos


186
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,606
of these 500 leaderboards.


187
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,686
Well, right off the bat, we
have three pretty obvious ways


188
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,626
or three pretty obvious sets


189
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,666
that we could organize a
single leaderboard into.


190
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,816
One characteristic of this
leaderboard is that it belongs


191
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,516
to the Water Planet group
of stages within the game.


192
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,336
There's also the boss
level for the Water Planet,


193
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,396
and its medium difficulty.


194
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,856
So right there, that's
three different sets


195
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,816
that this leaderboard
could belong to.


196
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,256
And while this leaderboard
could belong to these sets,


197
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,285
we could also add all the
other leaderboards that belong


198
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,696
to these appropriate
sets as well.


199
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:45,366
So the Water Planet set
contains all the stages


200
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:49,266
for Water Planet-- water
boss, medium, et cetera.


201
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,376
So just like with leaderboards,


202
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,336
Leaderboard Sets can have
names of players saved.


203
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,786
And moreover, depending
upon the set


204
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,486
that a leaderboard
is contained within,


205
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,536
the name for that individual
leaderboard can change as well.


206
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,956
So let's take a look
at the examples


207
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,286
of what this actually
means and how it works.


208
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,536
So we go back to these three
sets that we've defined


209
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:17,786
that the Water Boss Medium
Level leaderboard can be


210
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:18,486
contained within.


211
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,866
In Water Planet set, we could
simply just name Water Planet,


212
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:27,176
and that Water Boss Medium Level
leaderboard, when it's contained


213
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:30,426
within the Water Planet, that
is when the player has navigated


214
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,756
to the Water Planet set to
look at this leaderboard,


215
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,736
we could just display
the string boss medium.


216
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:39,816
From here, it's clear that
this is the Boss Medium Level


217
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:42,806
leaderboard for the Water
Planet group of stages.


218
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,986
There's no redundant
information.


219
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,486
Everything is very
much contextual.


220
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,646
And we can go and name all the
other leaderboards appropriately


221
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:51,626
for that set as well.


222
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:55,936
Then the Water Boss Set,
just call it Water Boss.


223
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,976
That same leaderboard when
it's in the Water Boss Set,


224
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,116
we only have to call it medium


225
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,516
because it's obvious it's the
medium level of difficulty


226
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:03,976
for the water boss set.


227
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,146
We go and name all
the other leaderboards


228
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,156
in that set appropriately.


229
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,416
And then you're getting
the picture


230
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,806
with medium set, call it medium.


231
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,616
And we could call this
one stage Water Boss.


232
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,056
And name all the other
medium level leaderboards


233
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,386
in the medium set
appropriately as well.


234
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,986
So we've gone and we've
given this single leaderboard


235
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,386
different names depending
upon the way the players have


236
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,636
actually navigated to it.


237
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,966
But it's still the
exact same leaderboard.


238
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:36,216
That is, regardless of the
path that players happen to go


239
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,436
or take in order to find this
leaderboard, the exact same list


240
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,456
of scores is going to be
displayed to the user.


241
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,436
It's just really UI
customization option


242
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,766
that you have at your
disposal in order


243
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,846
to make information
contextual and not redundant.


244
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:57,436
So let's take a look at how
we can actually set your game


245
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,056
up in iTunes Connect in
order to use Leaderboard Sets


246
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:02,096
and start organizing
the leaderboards


247
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,026
of your game into these sets.


248
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:05,706
We're going to take a very,


249
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,546
very quick blow-by-blow
quick flyover here.


250
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,376
I definitely urge you to check


251
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,476
out the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow, however,


252
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,986
if you want to get more
detail as how you can set


253
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,366
up Leaderboard Sets
within your game.


254
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,696
So in the Game Center page for
your game on iTunes Connect,


255
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:25,386
in the leaderboard section of
that page is this new button,


256
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:27,586
Move All Leaderboards
into Display Sets.


257
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:31,886
When you click this button,
you're going to be asked


258
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:34,836
to create the very
first set for your game.


259
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,356
And now, the first thing that
you're going to have to do


260
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:41,226
when you're creating this
set is to find a handle.


261
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,966
This is really just the
name that you're going


262
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,556
to be referring to this set


263
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,756
when you're configuring
it on iTunes Connect.


264
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,586
This isn't the same as the
string that players are going


265
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,976
to see when they're
using your game.


266
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:54,756
It's really just a
convenience for you.


267
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,046
Then, after creating that
handle, that Set Reference Name,


268
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:04,246
you're going to have to
create a leaderboard set ID.


269
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:08,486
Just like leaderboards, you have
to create a unique identifier


270
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,446
for your set on iTunes Connect.


271
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,626
And we suggest that
you create it


272
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,836
as a reverse DNS style string.


273
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,286
So in this case, for
the Water Planet set,


274
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,656
we're going to give it
this reverse DNS string.


275
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,566
Now, after that,
you've created a set.


276
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:25,776
And from creating a set, you
actually have to give it a name


277
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,506
that is going to be
displayed to your players.


278
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,316
So the very next step you're
going to have to take is


279
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:35,386
within the Display Set
Localization portion


280
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,106
of the screen after
creating the set,


281
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,366
there's an Add Language
button here.


282
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,816
And you need to then go


283
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:47,906
and create language-specific
display names for this set.


284
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:52,876
So we could take, say,
English as the first language


285
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:56,186
that we're going to define
a name for, for this set.


286
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:00,226
We're going to name this Water
Planet set just Water Planet,


287
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,586
liked we talked about
in the example.


288
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:06,516
And then we can also create an
English locale-specific image


289
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:09,576
that we wish to be displayed
to players when they're looking


290
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:12,016
at this set on English
locale devices.


291
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,746
And then, further, if
you're creating your games


292
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,296
for multiple languages
either now or in the future,


293
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:22,646
you can create other
localizations as you see fit.


294
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:26,576
So after you've created the
display name for this set,


295
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,866
the next thing you need to
do is actually start adding


296
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:32,486
leaderboards in your
game into this set.


297
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,806
So you'll see another
part on the screen


298
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:37,496
that says Leaderboards in This
Set with Add to Set button.


299
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:41,146
Clicking that button, you're
going to be asked to select one


300
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,046
of the leaderboards that
you've already defined


301
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:43,896
in iTunes Connect.


302
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,766
Let's take that Water Boss
Medium Level leaderboard.


303
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,116
And then you're going to have
to give that leaderboard a name


304
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:53,846
when it's being displayed
within the Water Planet set.


305
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:59,156
So again, you choose a
language, give, in this case,


306
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:00,796
the English language
string that's going


307
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,006
to be displayed to your players.


308
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,916
And then either now
or in the future,


309
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,116
go and give other
languages if you decide


310
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,026
to localize your game
for multiple locales.


311
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:12,296
So that's really all there is to
it for actually setting up sets


312
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:13,066
within iTunes Connect.


313
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,156
Now, using Leaderboard
Sets programmatically


314
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,666
with the Game Kit Framework
is very straightforward.


315
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:23,086
We nowhave a GK Leaderboard
Set class


316
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,066
and it defines three fundamental
properties that you're going


317
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,086
to have to care about
when you're using sets


318
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:29,086
within your game.


319
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,536
The first is an NS string title.


320
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,936
Now this is really just the
display name that you set


321
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,646
up on iTunes Connect
for your set.


322
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,926
And if your game is running
on an English locale device,


323
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:42,296
it's going to display the
English name, Japanese


324
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,816
or Japanese name, et
cetera, et cetera,


325
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,856
just like how leaderboard
titles work today as well.


326
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,136
Then you're going to have
your NS string identifier.


327
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:55,486
This is just the set ID that
you defined on iTunes Connect.


328
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:58,666
And, as well, optionally,
there's the group identifier.


329
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,066
Now we didn't talk about this
in the iTunes Connect overview,


330
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:05,946
but just like how leaderboards
work with game groups,


331
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,526
a feature that we
introduced last year,


332
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:09,896
so too do Leaderboard Sets.


333
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,896
And we're not really
going to talk a whole lot


334
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,056
about the group identifier
in game groups


335
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,126
with Leaderboard Sets today,
but I definitely urge you again


336
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,976
to check out the iTunes
Connect session tomorrow


337
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,116
for more detail on that.


338
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,786
So we've got the GK
Leaderboard Set class.


339
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,606
Just like GK Leaderboard
objects before,


340
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,656
you can actually use
the sets that you've set


341
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,256
up on iTunes Connect
within your game.


342
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,886
The very first thing you need
to do is load all the sets


343
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,806
that belong to your game.


344
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,246
And you can do that calling
Load Leaderboard Sets


345
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,126
with Completion Handler.


346
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,646
Now, when your completion
handler is called, you're going


347
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:46,286
to be passed back an NS array
of GK Leaderboard set instances.


348
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,816
And from there, you're on free.


349
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,586
You can do anything
that you wish


350
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,236
with these leaderboard
set objects.


351
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,476
For instance, you can
load the leaderboards


352
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,016
that are contained
within those sets.


353
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:00,276
So when this completion handler
is called, we can take one


354
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:01,576
of the sets that
we've been given back.


355
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,516
And to load the leaderboards
that are contained


356
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,286
within that set, we could
call Load Leaderboard


357
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,996
with Completion Handler
or Load Leaderboards


358
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,816
with Completion Handler.


359
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:14,376
And when that completion
handler is called back,


360
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:17,316
you'll be provided an NS array
of GK Leaderboard instances.


361
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,796
And now I'm assuming that
you're already familiar


362
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:23,136
with GK Leaderboard
objects, from this point,


363
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,636
you can treat these objects just


364
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,906
like you would any other
GK Leaderboard object


365
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,836
within your game.


366
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:29,926
One other thing that you can do


367
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:33,346
with GK Leaderboard set
instances is to load the image


368
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,636
that you upload with
iTunes Connect for that set.


369
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,826
So within this Load
Leaderboard Sets


370
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:41,406
with Completion Handler called
back, you could take one


371
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,996
of those sets and call Load
Image with Completion Handler.


372
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:47,746
And that completion handler will
pass back a GK image object.


373
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:52,196
So a GK image object is
really just a typedef.


374
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,576
If you're running on iOS,
then that's going to point


375
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:58,476
to UI image, if you're running
on OS X, they'll be an NS image.


376
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:00,926
And once this completion
handler is called back,


377
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:03,036
you can use it just like
any other image asset


378
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:03,686
within your game.


379
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:07,576
So that's Leaderboard Sets.


380
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:11,435
Again, it's-- you can think of
them as a tagging architecture.


381
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:15,185
It allows you to group multiple
leaderboards into a set.


382
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,156
A single leaderboard
can be contained


383
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,526
within many different sets.


384
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,866
An important thing that I
wish to pint out here is


385
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,715
that if you wish to unlock
all 500 leaderboards, that is,


386
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:27,425
if you wish to adopt Leaderboard
Sets within your game,


387
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:30,576
then you must make sure
that every leaderboard


388
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:35,546
that you create within your game
is a member of at least one set.


389
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:39,086
So let's move on to the next new
thing with leaderboards today,


390
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,556
Most Recent Score Leaderboards.


391
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,726
So you're all probably
already familiar


392
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,766
with how leaderboards
work within Game Center,


393
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,656
the best score ranking system.


394
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,746
That is, if you've got
an ascending leaderboard


395
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:53,306
or ascending sort
order leaderboard,


396
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,756
and your player happens to
earn 10,000 points today,


397
00:17:56,756 --> 00:18:00,276
then tomorrow, when they
score 5,000 points, let's say,


398
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:04,916
5,000 isn't better than 10,000,
so 10,000 is going to remain


399
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,206
on the all-time time span
for that leaderboard.


400
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,876
Or what if you want to
implement a leaderboard


401
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,416
where scores can both go
up and down over the course


402
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,366
of people playing your
game, like batting average.


403
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,716
If you want to track your
player's batting average


404
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,216
over a season, that's going


405
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,926
to not just be monotonically
increasing or decreasing,


406
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,916
it's actually going
to be increasing


407
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,566
or decreasing over time.


408
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:29,376
So that's what a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard allows you


409
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,126
to do.


410
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,246
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
they're just an alternative


411
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,586
to Best Score Leaderboards.


412
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,306
And the way that they function
should be pretty obvious


413
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:37,906
by the name.


414
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:41,306
It's just that the next score
that you submit to a leaderboard


415
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:43,726
for your player, that's going
to be the score that shows


416
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,546
up on the leaderboard
in Game Center.


417
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:51,346
So really, what this means, it's
actually a very profound effect


418
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:55,616
of this is that it allows you
to take full 100 percent control


419
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,966
over the ranking system
for this leaderboard.


420
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:01,216
You could do things like power
rankings for your chess game


421
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,376
or your legendary
RPG Heroes game.


422
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,846
You could do win/lose
percentage or even, you know,


423
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,496
simpler things like batting
average or golf strokes or OPS.


424
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:12,356
Really, it's entirely up to you.


425
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,596
And setting up a Most
Recent Score Leaderboard


426
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,236
for your game is really
just a single checkbox away


427
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,976
on iTunes Connect.


428
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,166
Within the Leaderboard
Configuration screen


429
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,556
on iTunes Connect when you're
creating a new leaderboard,


430
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,296
you'll notice that there's a
new field here called Score


431
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,006
Submission Type.


432
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:33,406
Now by default, that Best Score
field is going to be clicked.


433
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:38,536
However, if you click the Most
Recent Score checkbox right


434
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,096
there, that instantly
turns this leaderboard


435
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,786
into a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard.


436
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,666
Now you may already be familiar


437
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,016
with the Sort Order field
right below, we've had this


438
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:51,076
for a long while already.


439
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,346
Sort Order is just as applicable


440
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,906
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards as it is


441
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:58,286
to Best Score Leaderboards.


442
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:02,296
If you say set this
to low to high,


443
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,746
then the lowest scores are going


444
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:04,976
to get the best ranks
on this leaderboard.


445
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,196
So using baseball,
again, as an example,


446
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,166
if you want to track ERA, you'd
probably want it to be low


447
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,126
to high because lower is better.


448
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,646
High to low for batting average.


449
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,486
You want it so that the highest
scores get the best ranks.


450
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:24,296
So Most Recent Score
Leaderboards programmatically


451
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,436
are identical.


452
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:28,946
100 percent identical to
regular best score leaderboards


453
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:30,106
in the Game Kit Framework.


454
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:33,556
However, since you are
now being given the power


455
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,706
to entirely customize the
ranking system that's afforded


456
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,426
to you, there's a lot of
things that you could do


457
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,616
when you're preparing these
scores for submission.


458
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,186
So let's take a look at an
example of what you could do.


459
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,916
Let's say that you want to
create a power ranking system,


460
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:53,216
that is, you have a
multiplayer game and you've got


461
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:56,206
like a ladder ranking system
within your game so that


462
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,996
if a high-rank player and a
low-rank player play each other


463
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,106
in a match and the low-rank
player happens to win,


464
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:04,496
then the low-rank player's
rank is going to jump


465
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,516
up the difference of those two
players' ranks, and vice versa,


466
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,226
the high-rank player,
because he lost,


467
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,766
is going to drop
by the difference.


468
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,576
Well, what we could do here
programmatically is at the end


469
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:20,016
of the match, we could
load the leaderboard scores


470
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,706
for those two players, the local
player and the other player,


471
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,456
setting the identifier for
the GK Leaderboard object


472
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,796
to that Most Recent Score
Leaderboard identifier you've


473
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,636
set up on iTunes Connect.


474
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,446
So once you've loaded the
scores with completion handler


475
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,976
and your completion
handler is called back,


476
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,306
you can grab the score values


477
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,316
for both the local player
and the other player.


478
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:45,936
And then, based upon the
previous power ranking, that is,


479
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,936
the local player's value
of the local player


480
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,216
and the previous ranking of
the other player's value,


481
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,446
as well as the outcome


482
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,026
of the match whether the local
player happened to win or lose,


483
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,056
you can create a new
local player score value.


484
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,976
Then from there, you
submit these scores just


485
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,276
like you would any other score


486
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:06,036
to any other regular
old leaderboard.


487
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:10,656
You allocate a native score
with the leaderboard identifier


488
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:13,526
for the Most Recent Score
Leaderboard, you set the value


489
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,456
to the new local player's
value, and then, finally,


490
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,626
you call report scores
passing in an array


491
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,056
with that local player's score.


492
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,286
So, really, that's all there is


493
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:26,456
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards.


494
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:30,516
It's very, very similar
to how you would work


495
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,686
with Best Score leaderboards
programmatically,


496
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:35,406
but since there's so much
else that you can do in order


497
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:39,006
to customize the
ranking system, really,


498
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:42,976
the opportunities are
endless as to what it can do.


499
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,216
So while we're in the
neighborhood of GK Leaderboard


500
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,356
and its API, I just want to
touch on a couple of changes


501
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,996
that we have this year with iOS
7 for the Game Kit Framework.


502
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,206
First of all, you
may be familiar


503
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,336
with the GK Leaderboard
Category property.


504
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:59,596
That was a pointer for basically
the NS string identifier


505
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:00,846
that you set up on
iTunes Connect.


506
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,206
We're deprecating this in favor
of the identifier property.


507
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,996
And the reason is basically


508
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:10,466
because with GK Leaderboard
Sets, sets and categories,


509
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,886
they sound sort of familiar
or similar to each other,


510
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:16,096
so in order to, you know,
allay any confusion,


511
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,776
we're deprecating the
category property.


512
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,786
You may also be familiar with
the Set Default Leaderboard


513
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,126
with Completion Handler Call


514
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,396
on GK Leaderboard
as a class method.


515
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,526
Now, this basically allowed
you to make it such that


516
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:32,536
when a player is viewing your
game within the Game Center app,


517
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,136
that the very first leaderboard
that they're presented


518
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:38,516
with within your game detail
view is the leaderboard


519
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:39,206
that you're choosing.


520
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,586
But since this is something that
isn't so much of the property


521
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:45,266
of the leaderboard, but
much more the local player,


522
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,326
we're deprecating the GK
Leaderboard method in favor


523
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:53,076
of GK Local Player Set
Default Leaderboard Identifier


524
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,306
Completion Handler method.


525
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,966
So use that instead in
case you're interested.


526
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:02,206
So we've talked a lot about
new leaderboard features today,


527
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:04,416
Leaderboard Sets, to
increase the maximum amount


528
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,626
of leaderboards that
you can use,


529
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:08,116
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,


530
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:11,356
and new ranking systems that
you can create using them.


531
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,086
Let's take a quick
peek under the hood


532
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,496
as to how actual
score submission works


533
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,096
in the Game Kit Framework
in the Game Center platform,


534
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,226
and what's going
on under the hood


535
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,896
when you're communicating
with Game Center.


536
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:28,666
So when your game is running
and it's making submissions


537
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,286
to Game Center, whether it's
running on an iOS device


538
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:35,646
or an OS X system, it's
actually not alone.


539
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:37,356
We have a daemon called gamed


540
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,276
that is always running
in the background.


541
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:42,106
And when your game
is communicating


542
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,696
through the Game Kit Framework
with the Game Center platform,


543
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,866
transparently, as in you don't
need to remember any of this,


544
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:50,996
transparently, your game
is actually establishing a


545
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:53,066
connection with gamed,
our daemon.


546
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,876
Then in turn, gamed is
establishing a connection


547
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,966
with the Game Center
servers in the outside world.


548
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,196
So when you submit
a score, let's say,


549
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:04,546
to the Game Center system,


550
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,176
you're actually submitting
that to gamed.


551
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,876
And now, gamed is going
to automatically relay


552
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,486
that to the Game Center server.


553
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:15,806
So why do we do this?


554
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:20,216
Well, let's say, for instance,
that internet connectivity


555
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:23,636
of the device happens to be
lost, and thus, the connection


556
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:25,876
with the Game Center
server is separate.


557
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,696
Well, for any score submissions
or achievement submissions


558
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,046
or any other type of submissions
happen to fail because of this,


559
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,856
gamed will automatically
store those requests


560
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:36,496
that you're making.


561
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:39,656
Any of the failed ones
or any of the future ones


562
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,986
that you're making to game d,
your game doesn't need to worry


563
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:45,486
about internet connect--
internet connectivity,


564
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,336
gamed is always just
there managing it for you.


565
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:52,066
So that when Game Center
server, the connection


566
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,926
with the server happens
to be reestablished


567
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,366
and the device comes
back online,


568
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:58,226
or even if your game happens


569
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,726
to go offline before these
submissions make it over,


570
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,456
gamed is going to immediately go


571
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,226
and forward those
score submissions


572
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:10,276
over to the Game Center
server on your behalf.


573
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:12,276
Really, you don't need to
worry about any of this,


574
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:14,186
it's all done transparently
for you.


575
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:18,326
So you may be familiar
with the report scores


576
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,756
with completion handler API
and how our completion handler,


577
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:26,306
as a signature, such that it can
pass back an NS error object.


578
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,776
This is largely vestigial.


579
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,546
This whole store and
forward mechanism


580
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,516
with the gamed daemon
is something


581
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,576
that we introduced in iOS 5.


582
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,006
So it's been running
up through today.


583
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,596
As long as your score and/or if
you're submitting achievements,


584
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,526
your achievements
happen to be in it


585
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:48,886
with the proper consistent
identifier that you set


586
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:51,376
up on iTunes Connect,
you don't need to worry


587
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,796
about checking this NS
error object and its value.


588
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,446
We're actually not going
to hand one back to you.


589
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:59,846
In the past, before we
implement the store and forward,


590
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:01,996
we used to ask you
to check to see


591
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,796
if there was an internet
connectivity error


592
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:04,836
that was handed back to you.


593
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,616
And if so, we asked you
to actually do the storing


594
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,016
and forwarding of
these requests later.


595
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,176
But you don't need to do that.


596
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,186
You haven't had to
do that since iOS 5.


597
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,426
So if you've got a code
like that within your game,


598
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,636
definitely take it out.


599
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:20,346
You don't have to worry


600
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,006
about caching your
scores and achievements.


601
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:23,906
In fact, we definitely
urge you not


602
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,276
to because there
are complications


603
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,096
that can arise with challenges.


604
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:30,416
Just the moment that your
player has earned the score


605
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,066
and achievement,
submit right away.


606
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:35,186
Give it over to gamed, it'll
do the heavy lifting for you.


607
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:39,376
And that being said, if you're
submitting multiple scores


608
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:41,866
for a single play-through
session, like, let's say,


609
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,746
your player is going to be
earning coins in the session,


610
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:48,686
they're also going to be getting
a track time around the level,


611
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,026
and then finally,
you're also going


612
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:52,406
to be submitting another
score for their high score


613
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,946
in that level, then those
are three different scores,


614
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,686
you should batch those into
a single NS array and pass


615
00:27:57,686 --> 00:27:59,686
that in via report
scores method.


616
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:03,876
So that's what new
in leaderboards.


617
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,066
A lot of new stuff.


618
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,916
We've got many more leaderboards
with Leaderboard Sets,


619
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,586
up to 500 leaderboards that you
can define within your game.


620
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:13,626
We also have Most Recent Score
Leaderboards that allow you


621
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:16,016
to create custom ranking
solutions for your game.


622
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:18,916
And we also took a quick
peek under the hood


623
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,216
of how gamed works when
you're submitting scores


624
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,416
and also achievements
and other requests


625
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,576
to the Game Center platform,
and how we do the heavy lifting


626
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:29,506
for you so you don't have to
worry about this caching logic


627
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:30,626
and network connectivity.


628
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:34,086
You just have to submit your
scores and then get right


629
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:37,796
on to letting players
play your game.


630
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:40,666
So we've talked a lot
about leaderboards today


631
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:44,266
on a very related topic that I
think dovetails pretty nicely.


632
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:46,986
Let's talk about how we can
limit cheating within your game.


633
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:52,186
Now you may all be familiar a
bit with screens such as this.


634
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,256
In case you don't recognize


635
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,256
that there's some
suspicious score values here.


636
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:00,876
I don't think, you know, the
six top players or however many


637
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,686
in this game happened to
have earned in 64 max,


638
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,366
but I don't think that's
actually ever humanly possible.


639
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:10,256
So clearly, something
suspicious is going on here


640
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,776
and it probably means
that there are people


641
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:12,686
who are cheating in the game.


642
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:16,446
I'm happy to tell you
today that with iOS 7,


643
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:19,906
we are doing three things
in order to help you limit


644
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,486
and combat cheating
within your game.


645
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,926
And the first is
completely free for you.


646
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:28,186
When your game is
submitting scores to gamed


647
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:33,076
on an iOS 7 device, when it
reaches gamed and gamed goes


648
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:35,456
to relay that score to
the Game Center server,


649
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:39,166
it is automatically attaching
a cryptographic signature


650
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,826
to the score submission, as well


651
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,526
as other submissions
like achievements.


652
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:46,046
So that if a nefarious player
happens to go and tamper


653
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,276
with that submission
when it's in midstream


654
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:51,026
to the Game Center servers,
that's going to get picked


655
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,106
up automatically and
Game Center is going


656
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:55,576
to reject that score outright.


657
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:57,736
That's free for you.


658
00:29:57,736 --> 00:30:00,836
You don't have to do any sort of
coding or configuration steps.


659
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,216
If your game is running
on iOS 7, we've gotten


660
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,526
that taken care of for you.


661
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:07,646
Now another thing that
you can do in order


662
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,406
to help limit cheating
within your game


663
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:13,646
like from an exploit
level or angle is


664
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:16,016
with the Score Range property


665
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,776
on the Leaderboard Configuration
screen in iTunes Connect.


666
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:22,326
If you've got a leaderboard
where it's only believable


667
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:27,816
or only humanly possible for
a player to legitimately earn


668
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:31,826
at most 10,000 points within
that leaderboard on your game,


669
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,496
then I definitely suggest
that you set that To Value


670
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,236
in the Score Range
field to 10,000.


671
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:43,256
What this does is it essentially
creates a visible score range


672
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,656
for scores within your
leaderboard for that game.


673
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:49,686
And what I mean by that is if a
player happens to submit, say,


674
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,656
one billion points
to this leaderboard,


675
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,956
when it's really only
humanly possible for them


676
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,856
to earn 10,000 legitimately,


677
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:58,236
then the Game Center
server is going to accept


678
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,476
that score submission, it's
just not going to be visible


679
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:02,946
to other players of the game


680
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,246
when they're looking
at that leaderboard.


681
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,576
So we're hanging on to
these scores, right?


682
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,356
There are a lot of reasons,
one is because circumstances


683
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,246
within your game
might actually change.


684
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,536
You might realize that you
forgot to carry the one,


685
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:19,356
for instance, when you're trying
out your game design docs,


686
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,986
and you realized that it's
actually totally allowable


687
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,626
and believable for a player to
earn at most a billion points


688
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,496
within this leaderboard.


689
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:28,226
So at a later time, you
can come back to the screen


690
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:31,236
in iTunes Connect, vamp that
To field up to a billion,


691
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:35,266
and that player's score
that was earlier hidden


692
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:37,616
by the Game Center server
will now become visible.


693
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:41,466
So this isn't an
unforgiving configuration set.


694
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:46,406
It's just another arrow in your
quiver to help limit cheating


695
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,976
and exploits within your
game, but it will allow you


696
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:51,356
to backtrack in case
you decide that, "No,


697
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:53,206
it's totally OK all along."


698
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,636
The third thing that we are
providing you with iOS 7


699
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,476
and OS X with iTunes Connect


700
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:04,256
to help limit cheating is a
brand new configuration tool


701
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,206
within iTunes Connect.


702
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:08,726
And this tool is going to help
you audit suspicious player


703
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,616
activity on your
leaderboards of your game.


704
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:12,366
And now, we've got
a lot of things


705
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,456
that we're talking about today.


706
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:16,396
So I definitely urge you
to check out what's new


707
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,436
on iTunes Connect session
tomorrow 'cause they're going


708
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,816
to go into in-depth as to
how you're going to be able


709
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,686
to actively manage player
activity within your game,


710
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,036
'cause you know you're
being best, you made it.


711
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,566
And it's a living
breathing thing


712
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,746
so you understand it
as it's being played.


713
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,366
So with this tool, you'll
be able to make sure


714
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:34,006
that everything is
running smoothly.


715
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:39,166
So that's what's new in
security for Game Center.


716
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,286
We've got signed submissions,
this is totally free for you.


717
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:44,146
We are signing every
submission we're making


718
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:46,286
to the Game Center
platform and to the server.


719
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,336
So if anybody happens
to tamper with it,


720
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,586
when it leaves the device and
goes off into the internet,


721
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,826
we're going to detect that on
the other end and we're going


722
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,256
to reject those submissions
outright.


723
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:59,296
Definitely, I suggest you
use the Score Range field


724
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:03,226
within iTunes Connect on the
Leaderboard Configuration screen


725
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:07,706
in order to filter out
anybody who's exploiting issues


726
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:08,416
within your game.


727
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:12,096
And then finally, we've got a
new management tool that's going


728
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:14,566
to allow you to help audit
suspicious player activity.


729
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,456
And you can find out
more about that tomorrow.


730
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:24,276
So we've gone through new
leaderboard features as well


731
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:27,286
as how we can help you limit
cheating within your game


732
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,386
if it's Game Center enabled.


733
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:32,106
Let's move on to the next
topic today-- Challenges.


734
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,186
So Challenges was
a brand new feature


735
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:37,876
that we introduced last
year, and we've been thrilled


736
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:41,546
with the uptake and adoption
of challenges in your games.


737
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:45,386
And we introduced, again, last
year with iOS 6 Mountain Lion.


738
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,776
And what it really does is
whether your game is a single


739
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,996
player or a multiplayer,


740
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,576
challenges add a competitive
element to your game.


741
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:56,566
If your game support
leaderboards or achievements


742
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:59,566
within Game Center, and
players can challenge each other


743
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,716
to either meet or beat
those leaderboard scores


744
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,736
or to earn those achievements
that they've earned.


745
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:08,065
And this was also supported
automatically whether


746
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:11,016
through the Game Center
app on iOS or OS X


747
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,025
or through the GK Game Center
view controller, players that go


748
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:18,076
through our UI, select their
scores, challenge their friends


749
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:19,996
to beat those scores,
same with achievements,


750
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,666
and players would start
receiving notifications


751
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,626
and would complete
everything, and it was great.


752
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:29,536
We also provided you, however,
with API to extend your game


753
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,416
for custom challenge
gameplay to hook into events


754
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,116
when players happen to
complete a challenge,


755
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:37,025
and also to allow you to issue
challenges programmatically


756
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:37,676
within your game.


757
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:42,556
So before we talk about what's
new in Challenges this year,


758
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:44,206
let's just do a quick run


759
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,856
through of how Challenges
work currently.


760
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:49,906
So let's say Tom is playing
a racing game and he happens


761
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,636
to earn a lap time of 50
seconds around the track.


762
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,706
Then he could challenge
Alice to go


763
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:57,516
and beat his lap
time of 50 seconds.


764
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:59,596
So he sends a challenge
to Alice.


765
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:03,846
Alice gets that challenge
and she opens up your game,


766
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,476
and she happens to play that
same track getting a score


767
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:09,256
of 40-second lap time.


768
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:12,006
Now, 40 seconds is
better than 50 seconds,


769
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,436
so Alice has completed
that challenge.


770
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:16,316
She gets a push notification
to her device


771
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,846
from the Game Center
server telling her


772
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,006
that she just beat
the challenge.


773
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,966
Automatically in the background,
since the score challenge,


774
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,656
Tom gets a new challenge
from Alice challenging him


775
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,416
to beat her score of 40 seconds.


776
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:33,226
So that's great and that's
how Challenges work currently.


777
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:36,126
But let's say that
Tom happened to earn


778
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,826
that lap time using a beat-up
old pickup truck per se.


779
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:43,536
So it might be hard to actually
get 50 seconds as a lap time


780
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:46,316
with a beat-up old
pickup truck and much,


781
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,276
much harder than doing it
with, say, a super car.


782
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:52,006
So how can we make it such that
when Alice gets that challenge


783
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,836
from Tom that she can only
complete that challenge as long


784
00:35:55,836 --> 00:36:00,076
as she's earned that score
with the same gameplay context


785
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,516
that Tom used to earn his score?


786
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,246
Well, that's what a new feature,


787
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,476
Modal Challenges,
allows you to do.


788
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,696
Now, Modal Challenges, what
they allow you to do is


789
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:11,956
when you're reporting scores
and reporting achievements


790
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:14,586
to Game Center, you can
optionally provide us


791
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,656
with a list of challenges
that you wish the server


792
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:19,096
to consider for completion.


793
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:21,956
And this entails some new API.


794
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:27,026
Report Scores and Report
Achievements now have extra


795
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:29,536
methods for Report Scores
with Eligible Challenges


796
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,756
with Completion Handler
and Report Achievements


797
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,006
with Eligible Challenges
with Completion Handler.


798
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,806
This API doesn't replace
the current Report Scores


799
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:39,716
and Report Achievements
API that you know.


800
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,356
It's really just an augmented
version in case you wish


801
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,796
to make use of Modal
Challenges within your game.


802
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,826
So let's take a look
at how we can make sure


803
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:52,636
that when Alice is earning
her lap time around this track


804
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:55,026
in your game that she
only completes challenges


805
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,946
that were earned for
that exact same car


806
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:00,436
that Alice has raced
around with.


807
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:03,946
So at the end of Alice's
play through, right,


808
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,246
first thing that you could do
is load the Received Challenges


809
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,916
that Alice got from her friends,


810
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,146
and that completion
handler is called back.


811
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,916
You could filter through
any of the score challenges


812
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,396
because we only really care
about lap times in this case.


813
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:19,716
For every score challenge
that Alice has received


814
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:23,426
from her friend, there
is a context property.


815
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:27,696
Now this is something that has
existed forever in Game Center.


816
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:31,686
Every score has a UN64
property called context


817
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,806
that you can add any value
that you wish to the score.


818
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,766
And when you either submit
it to a leaderboard or attach


819
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,056
to a challenge, that context
is going to be attached


820
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:42,046
to that score on the other end.


821
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:46,506
So you could embed the car
model that Tom happened to race


822
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,896
around the track with on
that score that he used


823
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:49,736
to create the challenge.


824
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:51,786
And then on Alice's device,


825
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,286
you can pull the car
model out of that score.


826
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,846
All you need to do is check
to see whether the car model


827
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:58,916
for that challenge happens


828
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,236
to match the car
model Alice just used


829
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,156
to race around the track.


830
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:04,836
And if it does match,
you can add it


831
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,696
to these challenges
with same car array.


832
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,746
Really, just a list
of challenges you wish


833
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:11,076
to be considered by the Game
Center servers for completion.


834
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,556
And finally, you're going to use
the new API for Report Scores.


835
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:20,316
You're going to pass the
score that Alice just earned


836
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:23,886
in her play through session
and you're going to pass a list


837
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,896
of the challenges that
were created with scores


838
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,686
with the exact same care


839
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,436
that Alice just raced
around the track end.


840
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,086
And then the optional
completion handler.


841
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:35,186
And that's it.


842
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,626
That's how Modal
Challenges work.


843
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:40,916
As well as making sure
that only challenges


844
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:43,056
that makes sense can be
completed within your game,


845
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:45,116
this also allows
you to do things


846
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,696
like challenge-specific modes
within your game so that


847
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:50,166
when a player launches
your game because they wish


848
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,466
to play a single
challenge, you could set them


849
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:56,456
up an entirely new gameplay mode
so that when they are in a score


850
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:58,706
in that mode, only that
one challenge is completed.


851
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:00,806
Really, it's all up to you.


852
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:05,276
A new feature that we
have for Challenges


853
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,526
as well regards programmatically
issuing challenges


854
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:09,966
within your game.


855
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,126
Now, we allowed you to
programmatically send Challenges


856
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:17,636
to players within your game when
we released Challenges in iOS 6


857
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:18,946
and OS X Mountain Lion.


858
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:22,496
And we further augmented
this with iOS 7.


859
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,416
So let's say that your
player just happened


860
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,686
to complete a level and they
earned a score of 500 points


861
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,126
and maybe they even
earned an achievement,


862
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:33,526
right now will be a great
time to allow your players


863
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:35,136
to send a challenge
to their friends.


864
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,926
You don't want them to have to
exit your game in order to go


865
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:40,446
into the Game Center app to
do this, it's better for them


866
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,236
to just do it right here
so that they can get


867
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,696
on with playing your game.


868
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,856
Now again, last year, with
iOS 6 and OS X Mountain Lion,


869
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,376
we allowed you to do this.


870
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:53,776
We're making it even easier
this year by providing you


871
00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:57,466
with a friend picker and compose
controller that we create


872
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:59,306
on your behalf and
present to the player,


873
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:01,746
where they get a list
of their friends,


874
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,286
and if it's an achievement
challenge


875
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,386
which friends have earned
this achievement or eligible


876
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,096
to receive this challenge, the
player can then select friends,


877
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,086
one or many, that they wish
to send this challenge to,


878
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,946
pressing the Next button, up
comes a composed controller


879
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:18,186
with a preformatted
default message


880
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:21,756
that you can optionally pass
to us that they can edit,


881
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,986
and then they can choose to send
that challenge to their friends.


882
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:29,906
Using this composed
controller flow is very,


883
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:31,286
very straightforward.


884
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:33,196
And let's take a look
at how we can do this


885
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,516
with achievement challenges.


886
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:36,856
The first thing that
you're going


887
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:40,856
to do is allocate your GK
achievement object just


888
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,736
like you would in any
achievement challenge


889
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:44,736
that you wish to issue
programmatically previously.


890
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,096
You set up the achievement,
setting the identifier


891
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,386
with the appropriate
identifier on iTunes Connect.


892
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:52,756
And you make sure that you set


893
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:54,816
that percent complete
value to 100 percent.


894
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,796
You can only challenge friends


895
00:40:56,796 --> 00:41:00,096
to 100 percent complete
achievement, not part way.


896
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:04,586
And then, to get this
UI view controller


897
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:06,596
that represents the
composed sequence,


898
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:08,786
you're going to call a new API.


899
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:13,716
And it's available on both
GK achievement and GK score,


900
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,196
and it's this method here.


901
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,486
Its challenge composed
controller with players


902
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,276
where you can pass in an
optional list of friends


903
00:41:21,276 --> 00:41:23,466
of the local player that
you wish to be preselected.


904
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,956
Then a message which is
an optional NS string


905
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,796
that you can pass that will pop
up in the composed controller


906
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:32,066
as the default message
that players can then edit.


907
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:34,056
And then the completion handler.


908
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,796
And when the completion
handler is called back,


909
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:38,496
that means that the
player happen


910
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,356
to either send the
challenge to their friends


911
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:42,706
or cancel sending the challenge.


912
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,396
And at this point, you need
to dismiss the view controller


913
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,286
and then do whatever
post processing you wish


914
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:50,326
because we also tell you
whether the player happened


915
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:54,006
to really issue that challenge,
and if they did, which friends


916
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,946
and player IDs they
sent that challenge to.


917
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:59,586
And then finally, once
you've gotten this incense


918
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:02,246
of the UI view controller,
you just need to present it


919
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,806
like you would any other UI
view controller within your app.


920
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,156
And that's it.


921
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:08,776
That's how you do
programmatic issuing


922
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,036
of challenges with iOS 7.


923
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:14,386
We think it makes it even
easier in order to allow players


924
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:15,686
to send challenges
to each other.


925
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,346
So you may be familiar already


926
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:22,526
with our existing
Issue Challenge


927
00:42:22,526 --> 00:42:23,656
to Players Message method.


928
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:26,646
And since we've really
streamlined the way


929
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:30,766
that you can send challenges to
friends of your local player,


930
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,816
we're deciding to
deprecate this method.


931
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:35,026
And instead, we urge you to move


932
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:37,196
on to using the Challenge
Composed Controller


933
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:41,236
with Players Message
Completion Handler, the new API.


934
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:45,116
Now, in case your game is
running on an iOS 7 device


935
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:48,826
and is still using this legacy
API, they'll still work,


936
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:51,696
but we're going to present
a composed controller


937
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,866
and friend picker to the player
on your behalf automatically.


938
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,386
And this is great, but
I definitely urge you


939
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:00,006
to consider moving
over to the new API


940
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:02,826
because if you were
programmatically sending


941
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:05,196
challenges in the middle of
a gameplay session per se,


942
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:08,096
you definitely don't want
a view controller to pop


943
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:11,516
up in the middle of a player
jumping over a very wide pit.


944
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:13,916
So you know when
the timing is best


945
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,066
to actually present this UI.


946
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:18,466
So definitely move on to
the new API that we have.


947
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,206
So that's what's
new in Challenges.


948
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:25,056
We've got modal challenges
for selective completion


949
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,106
of challenges within
your game based


950
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:28,506
on context that you define.


951
00:43:29,426 --> 00:43:33,186
We've got brand new programmatic
issuing of challenges API


952
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:35,726
to make it even easier to
send challenges to friends


953
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:36,926
with a local player
in your game.


954
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:40,676
And we've also-- because
of this streamlined API,


955
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,826
we've deprecated the
issue challenge API.


956
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:46,036
And if your game still happens
to use it when it's running


957
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:49,566
on iOS 7, it's still going
to work, but the new UI,


958
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:51,776
that new view controller,
is automatically going


959
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:53,136
to be presented to
the local player.


960
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:57,176
So that's Challenges,
that's what's new


961
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:58,616
in Game Center for Challenges.


962
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:00,766
Let's move on to the next
big topic of the day--


963
00:44:01,276 --> 00:44:03,526
handling events relevant
to the local player.


964
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:07,006
Now you may be familiar
with handling events


965
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,806
for the local player in the
Game Kit Framework today.


966
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:12,856
We have a lot of different
singleton objects that you had


967
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:14,126
to declare delegates for.


968
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:18,146
If you want to hook into when
the local player completed the


969
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:20,136
challenge, we have the GK
Challenge Event Handler


970
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:23,216
Singleton and we had the GK
Challenge Event Handler Delegate


971
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:26,496
Protocol that you would set as a
delegate for that event handler.


972
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:28,526
We also had things
for turn-based match--


973
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:31,756
or for a turn-based gameplay,
they had a singleton object,


974
00:44:31,806 --> 00:44:34,226
and the GK Matchmaker
had an invite property.


975
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:39,186
Well, we've thoroughly revamped
the way and redefined the way


976
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:42,266
in iOS 7 that you can
handle events relevant


977
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,146
to the local player.


978
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:45,486
And we're doing it like this.


979
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:49,786
You can think of the GK Local
Player instance as the source


980
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:52,516
of all the events that are
relevant to your local player.


981
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:55,966
And so, whether the players
received the challenge,


982
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,306
completed the challenge,
gotten a new turn,


983
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:01,046
maybe a turn-based invite
or some matchmaking invite,


984
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,706
that's going to be channeled
through the local player.


985
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:08,006
And the local player can have
multiple listeners registered


986
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:08,346
to it.


987
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:11,916
And when a local player
listener is registered


988
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,536
on the local player and a
message happens to come in,


989
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:17,866
an event is triggered, that
listener or any listener


990
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:21,926
that is compatible for that
callback is going to get called.


991
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,256
Your listener object when you
register on a local player,


992
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:28,626
it needs to conform to the GK
Local Player Listener Protocol.


993
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:33,796
And this protocol, in turn,
conforms to three sub-protocols,


994
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:36,156
all defining optional methods.


995
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:38,596
None of the methods in these
protocols are required,


996
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:39,686
so you can pick and choose.


997
00:45:39,726 --> 00:45:42,536
First is the GK Challenge
Listener Subprotocol


998
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:44,656
that defines the
various callbacks


999
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:45,896
that you can optionally conform


1000
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:49,116
to when the player has completed
a challenge or had some sort


1001
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:51,156
of challenge relevant
event occur.


1002
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,136
We've also got GK
Turn-Based Event Listener


1003
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:56,616
for turn-based gaming
specific callbacks


1004
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,476
and GK Invite Event
Listener for GK Matchmaking,


1005
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:02,426
real-time matchmaking callbacks.


1006
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:06,646
Once you've created your
listener, in order to register,


1007
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:07,836
it's very straightforward.


1008
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:10,696
I'm going to adopt one of
these subprotocols or any


1009
00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:13,356
of those methods and those
subprotocols, and you're going


1010
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:16,176
to call on the Local Player
Instance Register Listener


1011
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:19,406
passing this listener
instance that you've set up.


1012
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:23,456
And you can pass-- you can
register multiple listeners.


1013
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:26,746
And you also don't need
to worry about the timing


1014
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,396
that you're registering
these listeners.


1015
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:31,706
You may be familiar that
previously we asked you


1016
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,756
to register or set delegates
on turn-based event handlers,


1017
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,886
challenge event handlers,
all those other singletons


1018
00:46:38,276 --> 00:46:40,596
in the authentication
handler callback.


1019
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:43,176
Well, you don't need to
worry about that anymore.


1020
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:46,616
In case your-- the local player
happened to receive some sort


1021
00:46:46,616 --> 00:46:49,536
of event and there is
no listener registered


1022
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:51,636
for the local player at
that time that could handle


1023
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:54,246
that event, the local player
is going to cache that event.


1024
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,406
So when you register
listener at some time later,


1025
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:01,156
it'll have that event to
dispatch to your listener or all


1026
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:06,326
of the listeners that are
capable of handling that event.


1027
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,376
So since we've talked a
bit about challenges today,


1028
00:47:09,616 --> 00:47:11,186
how about we take a look
at the group of methods


1029
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,776
that you can implement
optionally within your listener


1030
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,386
in order to hook into
challenge relevant gameplay?


1031
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:21,156
The GK Challenge Listener
Subprotocol defines four


1032
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:25,086
different methods that you can
optionally implement in order


1033
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:27,526
to hook into challenge-specific
events concerning the


1034
00:47:27,526 --> 00:47:28,186
local player.


1035
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:31,556
Let's take a quick look
through these different methods,


1036
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,846
what they mean, and
how you can use them


1037
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:37,026
within your listener
object or objects in order


1038
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:40,336
to enable custom challenge
based gameplay in your game.


1039
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,926
The first is concerning
selecting challenges.


1040
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,226
That is, when a player
happens to receive a challenge


1041
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,696
from a friend, whether
they are playing your game


1042
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:54,576
or they're hanging around
in the Game Center app,


1043
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:58,876
and they tap an iOS
notification center banner


1044
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,796
or they tap a play bubble
within the Game Center app,


1045
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,166
or if they tap a play bubble


1046
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,036
within the GK Game
Center view controller,


1047
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,456
we're going to call back to
your listener Player Wants


1048
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:10,266
to Play Challenge.


1049
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,146
And really, what this means is


1050
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,956
that the player tapped this
challenge banner and they want


1051
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:17,276
to play your game in order
to complete that challenge.


1052
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,406
So at that point, if you've
got challenge-specific gameplay


1053
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:24,356
modes within your game, you
can call Self-Start Challenge


1054
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:26,086
for Challenge if you've
got a method like that,


1055
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:27,646
passing in the challenge to set


1056
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:29,816
up this gameplay
mode for challenges.


1057
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,656
Similar to selecting
challenges within your game,


1058
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:36,076
we also got receiving
challenges.


1059
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:39,466
This is an event that
is called back to your--


1060
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:40,966
on your local player listener


1061
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:44,526
when the player is playing your
game currently and they happen


1062
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:45,906
to receive a challenge
from a friend.


1063
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:49,836
At that time, player did receive
challenge is going to called


1064
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:53,356
on your listener and you may
wish to present some custom UI,


1065
00:48:53,356 --> 00:48:55,366
like if Alice sent
Tom a challenge


1066
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,106
to beat her track
score, you might want


1067
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:00,116
to show Alice's picture right
there with the challenge message


1068
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:01,166
that she happened to define.


1069
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:03,196
And you could do that
within this method.


1070
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:08,066
The last two methods in the GK
Challenge Listener Protocol are


1071
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:09,966
concerning completing
challenges.


1072
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:13,516
The first, when the local player
happened to complete a challenge


1073
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:15,806
that they receive from a friend,


1074
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,826
Player Did Complete Challenge
Issued by Friend is called


1075
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,966
when the local player completes
a challenge in your game.


1076
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:24,026
And at this point, you know,
if you want to congra--


1077
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:26,356
display a congrats banner to
the player or whatever UI,


1078
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:29,366
maybe even reward them
gameplay-wise within your game,


1079
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:30,356
you could do that here.


1080
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:35,606
And then, also, when the
local player's friend happened


1081
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,676
to have completed the challenge
that the local player sent then,


1082
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:43,146
that's where Player Issue
Challenge was Completed


1083
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,656
by Friend is going to be
called back on your listener.


1084
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:48,246
At this point, you might
want to inform the player


1085
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,856
that perhaps their friends
are a little bit better


1086
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:53,126
than they thought they were,
and again, do whatever you wish


1087
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,466
in your game that makes sense.


1088
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:58,566
So that's just how
challenges work


1089
00:49:58,566 --> 00:49:59,956
with GK Local Player Listener.


1090
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:02,546
But we're also doing a lot


1091
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,046
of things concerning
turn-based gaming as well


1092
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:06,706
as real-time matchmaking.


1093
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,926
Those are all built with
the GK Local Player Listener


1094
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:11,946
architecture as well.


1095
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:15,726
And as you may guess, that
means that we are, in turn,


1096
00:50:15,956 --> 00:50:18,276
deprecating the GK
Challenge Event Handler,


1097
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:22,136
the GK Turn-Based Event Handler
Singleton and their delegates,


1098
00:50:22,136 --> 00:50:24,206
as well as the Invite
Handler property


1099
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:26,646
of the GK Matchmaker object.


1100
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:30,886
And since this affects
multiplayer as well, tomorrow,


1101
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,416
Nathan's got a multiplayer
session,


1102
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:35,836
making multiplayer
games with Game Center,


1103
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,876
I definitely urge you to
check that out in order


1104
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:41,196
to learn how you can adopt GK
Local Player Listener Protocols,


1105
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,596
in order to use turn-based
gaming


1106
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,546
within your game
and GK Matchmaking.


1107
00:50:47,616 --> 00:50:51,366
So we've learned a lot of
different things today.


1108
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:54,476
In addition to our brand new
UI that we've also got going


1109
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:56,446
on with the GK Game
Center view controller,


1110
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,066
we've increased the maximum
amount of leaderboards


1111
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,046
that you can use within your
game to 500 leaderboards.


1112
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:04,446
And you can impose a
hierarchical structure


1113
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:07,696
on these leaderboards with a new
feature called Leaderboard Sets.


1114
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:10,726
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
in case you want to make it


1115
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:14,006
such that player scores on
a leaderboard can go both up


1116
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:17,556
and down, and completely
customize the way


1117
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:19,516
that you rank players
within a leaderboard


1118
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:21,086
for your game, we've
got those too.


1119
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:25,236
Security measures that
we're taking on your behalf


1120
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:28,886
and we're also allowing you to
take in order to help combat


1121
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,046
and limit cheating
within your game.


1122
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,936
Challenges, we've
got modal challenges,


1123
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:36,916
further augmenting
challenge-based gameplay,


1124
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:39,866
and making it even easier
for you to allow your friends


1125
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,396
to send-- or your
players to send challenges


1126
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:43,726
to their friends
within their game.


1127
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:48,126
And then finally, we have
totally redefined the way


1128
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,926
that you can handle
events with--


1129
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:51,896
concerning the GK Local Player--


1130
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:53,976
with the GK Local
Player Listener API.


1131
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,046
So it's a ton of stuff that
we've got going on this year,


1132
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,516
and that means that you probably
have a lot of questions.


1133
00:52:01,046 --> 00:52:02,936
So Allan Schaffer,
he's our Graphics


1134
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:04,386
and Game Technologies
Evangelist.


1135
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:05,966
You can reach him at
this address right here.


1136
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:09,276
Ask him if you've got any
questions after the conference.


1137
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,456
Also, we've got brand
new documentation updated


1138
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:15,346
for this year's Game Kit
Framework available at the URL


1139
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:18,746
in the screen, as well as
at developer.apple.com,


1140
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:21,496
we've got some sample code
exhibiting how you can make use


1141
00:52:21,496 --> 00:52:25,926
of best practices in order to
adopt Game Center features,


1142
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:29,456
both new for this year
with iOS 7 and preexisting.


1143
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:30,956
So definitely check that out.


1144
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:34,736
As well as Apple developer
forms, definitely use those.


1145
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:38,676
So a couple of sessions, what's
new in iTunes Connect tomorrow,


1146
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:40,806
check that out if you want
to learn more about how


1147
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:42,546
to use game groups
for Leaderboard Sets,


1148
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,616
this new auditing tool
to help limit cheating,


1149
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,836
turn-based gaming
with Game Center.


1150
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:48,726
So thank you so much everybody.


1151
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:49,896
Have a great WWDC.


1152
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,446
It's been a pleasure.


1153
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:53,016
[Applause]


1154
00:52:53,016 --> 00:53:02,436dle
[ Silence ]


1155
00:52:53,016 --> 00:53:02,436
[ Silence ]
