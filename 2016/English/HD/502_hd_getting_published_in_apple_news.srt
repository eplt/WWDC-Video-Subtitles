00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:19,000
[ Music ]


2
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:22,406
>> Alright.


3
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,556
Good afternoon, everyone.


4
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,061
[ Applause ]


5
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:28,876
Welcome, and thank you for
coming to this session.


6
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,735
My name is Ryan Griggs, and I
work on the Apple News team,


7
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:36,546
and I am thrilled to be here
this afternoon to talk to you


8
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,346
about some of the great things
you can do in Apple News,


9
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,326
how to get set up, and
some best practices.


10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,866
So we have a lot to cover
today, and so I wanted to go


11
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,716
through a quick agenda
so we know where we are


12
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,566
in the presentation as
we, as we go through it.


13
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:53,336
So first we'll do a quick intro
to News to get an understanding


14
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,836
of sort of why News exists,
and what it's all about.


15
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,446
We'll also take a quick look
at the app to get some context


16
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:01,276
as far as where your,
your content


17
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:02,586
and your publication
will show up.


18
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,796
And then next we'll
learn how to set


19
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:09,816
up your channel using News
Publisher, which is the tool


20
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,976
that we use to manage
content in Apple News.


21
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,136
Then we'll do a quick
overview of RSS,


22
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:20,896
and then we'll dive a bit
deeper on Apple News Format.


23
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,826
Then we'll also talk about how


24
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,016
to publish articles
in Apple News.


25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,096
We have a few different
options and make it really easy


26
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,896
to author and then deliver
content into our system.


27
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,736
We'll talk about how to
make money off your content.


28
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,306
Talk about analytics
and insights.


29
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,706
Specifically, what's
available to you


30
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:41,306
as an Apple News Format
Publisher, and then talk


31
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,536
about a few best practices


32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,976
for making your publication
successful in Apple News.


33
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:51,186
So, first, let's do a quick
intro to the Apple News app.


34
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:56,126
So News was launched with
iOS9 last year with the goal


35
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:58,976
of delivering the best stories
from the best publishers,


36
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,846
and then personalizing
it for you.


37
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:06,596
And so News is built right into
iOS, which means it's available


38
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:12,116
to anyone with an iOS device
as long as they live in one


39
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:15,056
of the three countries News is
available in, and so News is


40
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:18,536
in the U.S., U.K. and
Australia right now.


41
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,856
And so one of the big parts
of News is Apple News Format,


42
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,316
which is our JSON
based document format.


43
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:30,086
It makes it possible to create
some amazing very engaging


44
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,426
experiences within
your articles.


45
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,596
And so we'll talk a bit
more about that later.


46
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,876
But in order to understand
how cool Apple News Format is,


47
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,986
I wanted to show you a few
articles that are good examples


48
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:41,866
of what you can do with it.


49
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,556
So this one is an
article from "Wired,"


50
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,316
and we'll actually
scroll through this


51
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,246
and take a look at
what's in there.


52
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:51,436
You can see there's a little
bit of parallax as we scroll.


53
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:52,556
There's beautiful imagery.


54
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,216
This is a photo mosaic.


55
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,916
Can tap in on the photos,
swipe through them.


56
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,926
It's really great,
immersive, and beautiful.


57
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:02,866
And you'll also notice, too,
that as we scroll, this is,


58
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,286
of course, a, a "Wired" article.


59
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:05,886
This looks like "Wired".


60
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,496
And so we give you the
tools to make your articles


61
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,456
and your channel
look like your brand.


62
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,916
So here's another
one from "Bloomberg."


63
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,666
Very different look to this,
but, again, very striking


64
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,956
with some beautiful photography.


65
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:21,736
You see we have some of
type on top of the images.


66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:25,156
As you scroll, some really
beautiful bold topography.


67
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,816
Great use of parallax here.


68
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,376
It really shows a lot of emotion
and depth in this article.


69
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,336
So another great example.


70
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,276
Show you one more.


71
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,116
This one in iPad.


72
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,966
You can really do a lot of
cool stuff with Apple News,


73
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,166
and this is an example of
a publisher of the BBC who,


74
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:43,216
who really created something
at the beginning of the article


75
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:44,876
that makes you want
to read further


76
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,426
and see what other great
stuff you might find.


77
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,176
So Apple News Format gives you
a lot of really cool tools.


78
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,686
So let's take a quick
look at the News app.


79
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,466
Just understand where
your content shows up.


80
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,936
So News is organized
into five separate tabs.


81
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,206
So first we have For You.


82
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,176
For You is a personalized feed
of articles that deliver content


83
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,156
that you're interested in based
upon what you're following


84
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:08,816
and what you're reading.


85
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,726
And it's got a huge update,
as you saw yesterday.


86
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,736
We have a completely new
redesign and all new look


87
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:19,766
and feel but also the concept of
sections, which include things


88
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,996
like trending, topic groups
based upon what you're following


89
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,736
in News, and then featured
stories which allow our editors


90
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,176
to find some of the
most beautiful,


91
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:30,286
engaging Apple News
format articles


92
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,176
and feature them
right in for you.


93
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:34,516
Favorites.


94
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:35,896
This is where your
publication goes


95
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,866
when a user taps the Plus
(+) button to favorite it,


96
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:41,306
and it allows you just to return
to your publication at any time.


97
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:43,546
And then we have Explorer.


98
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,606
This is where users will
go to find new channels


99
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:51,156
and then new topics, and so we
have topics and news in addition


100
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:55,386
to publications, and these
are essentially combinations


101
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,126
of articles from
different publishers all


102
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,286
around a specific topic.


103
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,546
So you can follow
things like sports


104
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,516
or heavy metal or
whatever you like.


105
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,576
Then, of course, we have Search.


106
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:08,706
We have hundreds of
thousands of topics in News,


107
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,216
and you can search for topics


108
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,476
and publications
in the News app.


109
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,196
And then, finally, your
articles can end up in Saved.


110
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:18,016
If a user starts reading
them but feels like they want


111
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,556
to finish reading it
later, and you can also look


112
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,746
at your history and clear
it if you like as well.


113
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,376
So that's how News is
organized within the app.


114
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,196
So during this session, we're
going to talk about some


115
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,556
of the best practices when
publishing news and how


116
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,816
to get set up, but, first,
let's discuss your publication


117
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,806
and how it shows up in News.


118
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,906
So publications in News
are called channels.


119
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,326
So what is a channel?


120
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,966
Well, this is what a
channel looks like,


121
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,676
and this is the one
we're going to create


122
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:48,126
in News today in
this presentation.


123
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,256
So channels represent your
publication in News are sort


124
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,896
of like your home page.


125
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:56,036
Articles you publish
appear in your channel,


126
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,556
and it's where users can
return to to engage more deeply


127
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,806
and directly specifically
with your brand.


128
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:06,046
So a good example for, of
a channel would be, like,


129
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:09,486
a magazines, a newspaper,
or a blog.


130
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:11,876
They're very customizable.


131
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,306
So you can really make them
reflect the look of your brand.


132
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,706
So you can do things
like customize the logo,


133
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,856
add a cover image, which
we'll talk about a bit later


134
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,256
and customize sections
to organize your content.


135
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:24,996
And you can create
more than one channel.


136
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:28,406
So if you have more than one
blog or more than one newspaper,


137
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,286
you can have a separate
channel for each one.


138
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:35,396
They can be based on Apple News
format or RSS, and you can link


139
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,546
to them just using
a regular link.


140
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,256
So how do we set up a
channel in News Publisher,


141
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,826
or to set up a channel
in Apple News?


142
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:49,216
You go to our web, online web
tool called News Publisher.


143
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,996
And so News Publisher
makes it really easy


144
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,666
to manage your presence
in Apple News.


145
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,706
It lets you do things like
set up and configure options


146
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,606
for your channels to
make sure it looks like


147
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:00,776
and works like you want it to.


148
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,786
It lets you assign roles to
people in your organization.


149
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:08,276
It lets you view analytics, set
up reports, and gain insight


150
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,576
on how your articles and
your channel is performing.


151
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,156
It also helps you set
up delivery of content


152
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,096
and helps you manage it.


153
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:20,036
It even lets you create Apple
News format articles right


154
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:22,266
from News Publisher, and we'll
do a demo of that shortly.


155
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,176
So a few things to think


156
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,006
about before you sign
up for Apple News.


157
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:28,676
You want to consider who will,


158
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:29,946
who's going to manage
the account.


159
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,746
Think about people like interns.


160
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,116
They eventually leave, and
you don't want to leave access


161
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,016
to your account to an intern


162
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,216
that won't be here
in a few months.


163
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,726
So make sure you give
access to someone


164
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,056
who will be with
you for a while.


165
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,826
So a common problem
that we have.


166
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,576
You also want to use a real
e-mail address that you own.


167
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,556
Sounds like an obvious thing,
but we actually communicate


168
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,236
with you via this e-mail
address if we find issues with,


169
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,996
for example, your RSS
feed or what we're finding


170
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,376
in your Apple News
format articles.


171
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,606
And so we want to be able to
use that to get a hold of you.


172
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,706
And also think about
international distribution.


173
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,706
So News is available in the
U.S., U.K., and Australia.


174
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,816
You want to make sure
that you've got rights


175
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:10,076
to deliver whatever
content, images,


176
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,186
etc. in Apple News
in these territories.


177
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:17,016
And so the easiest way to sign
up to publish in Apple News is


178
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,396
to go to our developer page or
just go to Apple.com/news scroll


179
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,926
to the bottom, and then
click on Sign-Up Now.


180
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,556
That will take you
directly to News Publisher.


181
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,046
So News Publisher
requires an Apple ID.


182
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,306
If you don't have one already,
then you'll be prompted


183
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,775
to set one up, although I
suspect most people here


184
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,216
have one.


185
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,025
And then once you've signed
up to publish in Apple News,


186
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:39,525
the News Publisher icon
will show up in iCloud next


187
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,856
to your other icons so you can
get back to it really quickly.


188
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:44,706
It's one of the great things
about using Apple ID is


189
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,596
that when you use the same one


190
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:47,986
as on your iOS device
it allows you


191
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,986
to easily preview articles
before you publish right


192
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:50,656
on your device.


193
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,486
So this is what News
Publisher looks like.


194
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:58,636
We're not going to dive into
it just yet, but we're going


195
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,896
to start up by talking about
a few of the things you need


196
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,856
when you're setting
up your channel.


197
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,276
So every channel, no
matter if it's using RSS


198
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,116
or Apple News format,
needs a few things.


199
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,406
One, it needs sections; two,
it needs a channel logo;


200
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,306
and it needs a cover image.


201
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:18,086
And so let's talk about the best
practices for a few of these.


202
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,066
So, first, sections.


203
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,836
So sections make it possible
to group your articles by type.


204
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:27,416
So, like, entertainment,
top stories, or sports.


205
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,516
You can have a lot
of sections in News,


206
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,286
but we really recommend
only having three to four


207
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,866
because essentially we
don't see people scrolling


208
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,706
to find more channels that are
off screen, and you want them


209
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:42,646
to fit on an iPhone
screen at rest.


210
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:47,146
And for the same reason as
using only as many sections


211
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,686
as you need, keep
the name short.


212
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,166
You don't want to
have really long names


213
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,706
that push your other
sections off the screen.


214
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:56,026
It's important to note that
the first section is always


215
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:56,646
the default.


216
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,306
So when users come to your
channel or return to it,


217
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,976
this is what they
will see first.


218
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,576
It's sort of like
the first impression


219
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,456
that they'll, that
they will see.


220
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,486
Another really important
note is when Apple News goes


221
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:12,216
and builds the For You feed,
it's going to look at articles


222
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:16,006
that are in your default first
section in your channel and pull


223
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,836
from there and not
your other sections.


224
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:21,786
So if you want to have your
articles potentially show up in


225
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,606
For You, for, in user's Apple
News app, you need to make sure


226
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,296
that you're publishing them
to the default section.


227
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,306
So for the channel logo,


228
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,206
the channel logo is
essentially an image


229
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,206
of your publication's logo.


230
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,806
And so for maximum
legibility, you want your logo


231
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,906
to be horizontal
text on one line,


232
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,866
use transparent background
with no fill.


233
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,926
If you don't use a transparent
background, you're going to end


234
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,026
up with a logo that looks
something like this.


235
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,966
Something that we see fairly
often, and we, we need to,


236
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,856
to reach out to publishers
to fix.


237
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,806
Also avoid using
just raw photos.


238
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,466
They're going to end
up being really small


239
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,436
in the various places
that we use them in News,


240
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,526
and sometimes we end up just
being a, a grey box as well


241
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:04,836
because they don't
have transparency.


242
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:10,326
We recommend having a logo
that's 256 pixels tall,


243
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:13,066
and then not more than
10 to 1 aspect ratio,


244
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,796
but don't make it any
wider than you need to.


245
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,656
Otherwise, it will make
it incredibly small


246
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,116
in some places like 4U Feeds.


247
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:22,466
If you can, avoid
things like copyrights


248
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,916
and trademarks alongside
your logo.


249
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,416
In many places, the logos
are very small on the screen,


250
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,686
and they just get lost
in the [inaudible].


251
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,516
And then, finally, with
promotional text or URL's,


252
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,036
you typically want to avoid
using those if you can.


253
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,546
The promotional text will be
very hard to read in places,


254
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,936
and just makes your
logo smaller.


255
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,546
And then URL's set
up the expectation


256
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:45,846
that they will be tappable,
which, of course, they won't be.


257
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:52,426
And so this is what a channel
logo looks like in the 4U Feed.


258
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,826
And so this is a
really important place


259
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:58,436
for your channel logo to look
great because the vast majority


260
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,856
of our users spend time in 4U,
and so you want to make sure


261
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,236
that your logo looks great
and is highly legible here.


262
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,416
So your logo also appears
in your channel tile,


263
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,036
and so the channel tile is a
combination of the channel logo


264
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:12,766
and what we call a cover image.


265
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,346
And a channel tile is
essentially your billboard


266
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,896
within News to bring readers
in, and this is what it looks


267
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:24,826
like in favorites, but it's also
featured in several other places


268
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,506
in News, including our
on-boarding experience.


269
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:30,806
This is where users first
enter News and make decisions


270
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,296
about who they're going to
follow in the Apple News app.


271
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,656
And so this is going to be
your only representation,


272
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:38,266
especially for those users
who don't know anything


273
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,206
about your publication.


274
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,376
You want to make sure
that you have a great logo


275
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,386
and a great cover image
that's representative


276
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,626
of what your brand is all
about and is super engaging.


277
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:50,886
We also have channel
tiles in Explorer


278
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:54,956
where editors can feature them,
and we have recommendations come


279
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,106
in the For You feed
occasionally.


280
00:12:57,296 --> 00:13:01,366
So it's a really important way
to drive users to sign up for,


281
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:03,806
to follow your channel
and to read it.


282
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,266
So to make the cover image look
as great as possible, please,


283
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,866
please submit a high-quality,
high-resolution images.


284
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,266
We recommend 600 x 600 pixels.


285
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,076
You can choose two
paths for this.


286
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,006
You can either do
a static cover,


287
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,136
which means that it
will always be the same.


288
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,816
This is great for brands


289
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,356
that have a really
identifiable logo mark, or an,


290
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:29,096
an image that users will
recognize when they see it,


291
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:32,856
but you can also choose to have
a dynamic cover image as well.


292
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,826
This is great if you want users
returning to your channel,


293
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,916
and they see your tile,
and it actually pulls image


294
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,146
from articles in your feed,
and so it stays very up to date


295
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:43,866
and dynamic with what's
happening in your channel.


296
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:48,116
So when you're signing up
to publish in Apple News,


297
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,826
you'll eventually
see this screen


298
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,826
where you can choose whether to
sign up for Apple News format


299
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,246
or whether to use RSS.


300
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,586
So we're going to talk
about each of these.


301
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,236
Let's briefly talk about RSS.


302
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,116
So when does it make
sense to use RSS?


303
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,046
So News supports displaying
articles from your RSS feed


304
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,026
if you have one, and it's
an appropriate solution


305
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:13,386
if you already have a website
or you already have an RSS feed,


306
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,956
and you want to get your content
into News really quickly.


307
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:20,066
But, ultimately, we only
really recommend using RSS


308
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,056
as a stepping stone to
get to Apple News format.


309
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,576
It's important to note that the
vast majority of articles read


310
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,136
in Apple News are using
Apple News format,


311
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,806
and so they're really engaging.


312
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,996
They have animations and
parallax and all of the things


313
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,296
that Apple News format allows.


314
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:38,516
And so if you're not using
Apple News format, it's a,


315
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,066
it's not a great comparison.


316
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,596
So we, it's always best
to use Apple News format.


317
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,006
But if you do need to use Apple
News format, or if you do need


318
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,466
to use RSS, these are some


319
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,386
of the features that,
that RSS supports.


320
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,356
Gives you the ability
to, to pull in images,


321
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:53,526
headlines, and excerpts.


322
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,366
We also show a preview
page of RSS articles


323
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,606
that it pulls from your feed.


324
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:02,816
And so this allows
those to, those previews


325
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,796
to load really quickly
so we don't have


326
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,146
to load from your web page.


327
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,506
We host the RSS excerpt.


328
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,566
So when you use a [inaudible]
article, it loads immediately.


329
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,596
And then, of course,


330
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,626
you ultimately will host your
web page if users choose to tap


331
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,526
through to your web page.


332
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,306
So there's some best
practices for RSS.


333
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:25,376
You want to make your
preview full and enticing.


334
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,186
If you make it really short,
the odds are users will tap in,


335
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,786
see that it's only a sentence
or two, and then go back out


336
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:34,066
and look for one of the many
Apple News format articles


337
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,046
that offer a full experience.


338
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:41,486
So use long form, full
text RSS when you can,


339
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,516
and avoid links to
unrelated content.


340
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,086
Things like boilerplates,
article footers,


341
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,836
terms and conditions, user
agreements, privacy policies.


342
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:52,226
You don't really need
that in your preview,


343
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,066
and it just clutters up the
experience and takes away


344
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,666
from the simplicity and
the beauty of your article.


345
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,526
And then Apple News
already has built


346
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:05,066
into some great sharing features
that users are accustomed


347
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,366
to using to share your
content is you don't need


348
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,906
to include links like tweet
this or like this on Facebook.


349
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:13,126
The app already takes
care of that, and, again,


350
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,656
it just adds noise
to your article.


351
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:20,506
Make sure your actual web page
is optimized for Safari on iOS.


352
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:22,866
The worst thing you can
have is a user follows


353
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,386
through the preview,
goes to your web page,


354
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,926
and then they have a big
desktop formatted website.


355
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,246
Then, finally, similar to
a point I made earlier,


356
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,286
make sure you provide a
dedicated point of contact.


357
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,336
So something happens
with your RSS feed,


358
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,986
and we're having trouble getting
your content to appear in News,


359
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,506
we want to be able
to reach out to you.


360
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,846
So when you first set up your
channel, your RSS channel,


361
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:47,176
you can configure your feeds,
and you do that by setting


362
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,026
up your sections that
we talked about earlier.


363
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,646
So you start out with
your default section.


364
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,746
This is the one that
For You pulls from,


365
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,246
and you can customize
that default section.


366
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,806
You can change the name, and
then there's a field to set


367
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:01,036
up your RSS feed, you can have
multiple RSS feeds for sections,


368
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,406
per section if you like.


369
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:05,016
And so this is what it looks
like once you have it populated.


370
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,715
You can reorder them, and change
them later if you like as well.


371
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:13,086
And so once you're up and
running and approved to go


372
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:17,935
in Apple News, this is what your
News Publisher interface will


373
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:18,465
look like.


374
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,915
You'll see we have a couple
tabs there where you can return


375
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,386
and manage your sections,
manage your channel info, etc.


376
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,196
But, ultimately, you want to
up, upgrade to Apple News format


377
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,526
as soon as you can, and so
we have a big blue button


378
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,096
at the top that makes
that really easy.


379
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,286
Once you click that, you can
just click OK in the dialogue,


380
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,166
and that'll move you on
to Apple News format.


381
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,086
So what can you do
with Apple News format?


382
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:42,926
Why is it so great?


383
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:48,406
Well, first, we provide a, a
robust content delivery network.


384
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,306
We have points of
presence around the world


385
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,926
that ensures lightning
fast loading and no delay.


386
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,806
Nothing will ensure people
won't read your article


387
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,426
like an article that
doesn't load.


388
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,846
We also supply rich analytics,


389
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:03,786
and we also automatically
optimize for each device.


390
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,906
Apple News format is really
focused on author wants


391
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:10,296
and having it look great on
any device automatically.


392
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:14,576
We provide simple but
powerful monetization tools.


393
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:19,166
We have a dedicated Apple News
editorial team that's just


394
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,116
looking for great
content every single day,


395
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,066
and that's a huge
opportunity for you


396
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,326
if you're creating really
engaging cool stuff.


397
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,016
We also have built-in
cross promotion.


398
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,296
So if publish an article
using Apple News format,


399
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,956
it's really easy to have at
the bottom of it, more articles


400
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,846
from your channel and related
articles from other channels.


401
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,816
It's a great way to
drive additional traffic.


402
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,826
Apple News format itself
supports lots of cool features


403
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,956
like animations,
parallax, galleries,


404
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:50,796
videos, photo mosaics.


405
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,666
It's incredibly powerful
and really easy


406
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,496
to add these elements
to your articles.


407
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:58,026
We also support dynamic
text sizing.


408
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:02,806
If you have that set in iOS
for improved legibility,


409
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,506
and then we're also
very accessible.


410
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,366
We have great support for
the accessibility features


411
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,626
in iOS like voice over.


412
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:11,146
And we have lots of
options for delivery


413
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,476
of content into Apple News.


414
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:17,306
So lots of advantages to
using Apple News format.


415
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,556
And so we clicked our
blue button in RSS,


416
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:25,436
and we've been approved
to use Apple News format.


417
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,236
And so we've got our channel
ready, but now we need


418
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:31,316
to deliver an article into Apple
News so we can take a look at it


419
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,616
and make sure that it's
formatted correctly and,


420
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,636
and is working as it should,


421
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,286
and so you can do
that a couple ways.


422
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:39,976
You can do that by creating
an article using the built-in


423
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,866
authoring tool, or you can
deliver an article via the API.


424
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,316
And so we'll talk about both
of those in more detail later,


425
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:50,386
but let's say that you've
delivered your article.


426
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,356
We'll take a moment to look
at it, and then we'll go


427
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,086
through a pending state.


428
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,846
And then once you're
ready to go,


429
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,326
you'll see at the top
available in News status,


430
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,976
and that means your channel
is live, ready to go.


431
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:04,556
You're starting, you're ready


432
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,296
to start publishing
articles in Apple News.


433
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:09,656
And so once you're approved,
you're going to notice


434
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,526
that you're going to have more
tabs there tha were available


435
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,436
to RSS, to your RSS channel.


436
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,406
And so there are
some new ones here,


437
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,716
and some of these
work differently


438
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:21,186
than the RSS sections.


439
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:25,116
So one example is the
sections tab itself.


440
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:28,096
You can see here that there
are no longer RSS feeds


441
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,626
that are associated
with each section.


442
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,236
You don't need your
RSS feed anymore


443
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,656
because Apple News format
handles all of that.


444
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:34,796
And, of course, you
can reorder them,


445
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,606
rename them here as
you like as well.


446
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,516
We also have the
ability to manage members


447
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,346
and roles within Apple News.


448
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,846
So if you work in a multi-person
team, it's really easy


449
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:47,736
to invite new users,
assign roles from admin,


450
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,306
which has full access
to everything


451
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,156
in News Publisher all the
way down to sales people


452
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:57,566
who only access analytics and
view articles or just viewers


453
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,776
who can only view
the content in it.


454
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,146e
So very powerful.


455
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,146
So very powerful.


456
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,236
So a few best practices when
you're using Apple News format.


457
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,516
First, you want to make sure
you're using appropriate


458
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,306
subject matter.


459
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,706
You want to avoid
things like click bait


460
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,696
or misleading headlines.


461
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,206
It's really not what
we look for in News.


462
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,786
News is also not
allowed to be created,


463
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,346
to be used as a marketing
platform.


464
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:18,426
We really encourage you to
create content that's going


465
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:21,366
to engage, inform,
and delight users.


466
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,896
And then take advantage of
Apple News format capabilities.


467
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:30,486
So use things like the animation
and the beautiful galleries


468
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,786
and imagery that
really draws users in


469
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:34,556
and makes them come back
and makes them read longer.


470
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,096
And use analytics
to your advantage.


471
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,636
Pay attention to what
users are reading,


472
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,806
and maybe they're reading a
lot of one type of article


473
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,866
or a specific article that
you've, that you wrote,


474
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,866
and they may want
to, you may want


475
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,956
to write more articles
like that.


476
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,386
Then, of course, you
want to monetize,


477
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:49,316
which we'll talk
about in a minute.


478
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,036
So three ways to get your
content into Apple News.


479
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,496
One is web authoring,
another is Apple News API,


480
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,626
and the third is plug-ins.


481
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,506
And so, first, let's
talk about web authoring.


482
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,746
So News Publisher supports
a rich drag-and-drop web


483
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:08,706
authoring experience.


484
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,896
The output's beautiful, simple,


485
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,826
Apple News Format
articles directly


486
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:13,836
to your channel in News.


487
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,476
So rather than showing
more slides,


488
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,976
let me show you a quick demo,
show you how easy it is.


489
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,556
Alright. So this is News
Publisher, and if you want


490
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,306
to make a new Apple
News Format article,


491
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:33,926
you can just click create
article, and then we land


492
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,236
in the authoring interface.


493
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,496
And so just a quick
tour of this.


494
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:39,556
We have our standard
toolbar for iCloud up here.


495
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:41,316
You have undo, redo.


496
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,446
We have a styling palette
that lets you change the look


497
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,826
and feel of each article.


498
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:46,566
We have a Publish button


499
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,586
that lets you publish
directly to your channel.


500
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:51,786
We also have a Help Link up
here, which is really useful


501
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,026
and very rich, very deep
if you're having any issues


502
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:55,736
with publishing in Apple News.


503
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,026
And then we've got
our header image


504
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,946
and the content of
the article below.


505
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,486
So let's start off
by making an article.


506
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:03,956
So for our header
image, we can choose


507
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:06,266
to have an image
with a text on top.


508
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,356
You can have the
text below the image,


509
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:11,696
or we can have a text-only
article with no image.


510
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:14,086
So let's go and create
an article


511
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,986
that has a beautiful image.


512
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:23,456
OK. And so let's go, and let's
bring in a nice header image.


513
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,236
Alright. So that looks nice.


514
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:35,516
Let's add a nice
title and a subtitle.


515
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:41,156
Let's go to an extra space here,
and then, and have the author,


516
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,046
let's put that in
the right spot, too.


517
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,186
And let's add some body text.


518
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:48,376
Rather than typing it, just
do a quick copy, paste.


519
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:51,326
Alright. So now we've
got the beginnings


520
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,046
of a beautiful Apple
News format article.


521
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,236
So you can do a lot of things


522
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,156
to make it really
rich and engaging.


523
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,146
So it's really easy to
add a link, for example,


524
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,486
if we can just, let's
go grab our link here,


525
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:06,686
and we can just select the text
we want to turn into a link,


526
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,506
and then we get a
nice pop over here.


527
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:11,626
We can just click the link
button, paste the URL in,


528
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,486
hit OK, and we've got a link.


529
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,206
And so you can also
add rich text.


530
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,766
For example, if we
just select some text,


531
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,316
we can make it italic.


532
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,766
We can also make it bold.


533
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:25,166
And so pull quotes are one
of the really cool things


534
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,176
about Apple News, and
so let's make one here.


535
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:31,226
Let's grab a piece of text,
and let's add it here,


536
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:34,076
and then if we select
this text, we can make it


537
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:35,886
into a pull quote
just with one click.


538
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,426
And so that really makes it
stand out and look beautiful.


539
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:42,106
Now let's do some, some work
on the styling of this article.


540
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,006
So if we click on
the Styling Palette,


541
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,456
we can very quickly jump
between different styles.


542
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:47,186
Here's modern.


543
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,656
A nice sanserif.


544
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,876
Here's bold, and let's
do classic for this one.


545
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,756
I think classic looks,
looks really nice.


546
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:59,386
OK, and let's mess around
with the colors a bit.


547
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:02,026
You can go with a darker
format if you'd like,


548
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:06,006
or you can try different
colors, but let's go with a blue


549
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,106
since that looks pretty nice.


550
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,716
It's also really easy to add
images in the body of your text.


551
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,666
So we just grab a
couple of images


552
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,666
from the desktop and drag it in.


553
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:23,866
The images pop right in, and
you can even add a caption


554
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,486
just by typing right
into the article.


555
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:26,876
So that looks pretty good.


556
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:28,346
I think we're ready to publish.


557
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,616
So we can just go up
to the Publish button,


558
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,176
and then remember what
I said about publishing


559
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:35,216
to your default section if you
wanted to show up in For You.


560
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,416
So let's publish it to Top
Stories, which is our default,


561
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,206
and then let's also
publish to Honeycrisp


562
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,156
because that's what
this article is about.


563
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,966
And we click publish, and
that article will be published


564
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:46,716
into Apple News.


565
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,496
Alright. So you can see
it's really easy to publish,


566
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:56,486
and this is what the articles
will look like on your devices.


567
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:00,116
Beautiful, formatted
perfectly for iPhone


568
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,886
and iPad automatically.


569
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:04,546
You can see at the
bottom we even have a more


570
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:07,116
from this channel
automatically added


571
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,116
to the end of this article.


572
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,216
So a few things to think


573
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,546
about when you're
authoring using the web tool.


574
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:16,106
First, choose a striking
cover image.


575
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,036
Great imagery drives
users into your article.


576
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:21,406
Use a consistent methodology
for fonts and for themes.


577
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:22,876
You want to have an
identity for your channel


578
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:25,746
that you follow regularly
without changing it up on users.


579
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,846
Try to include images
throughout the article.


580
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:30,406
This is really true for any
Apple News format article.


581
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,696
Use imagery and, and multimedia.


582
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:35,886
Also try to use pull
quotes and embedded links.


583
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,426
You know, use all of the
tools at your disposal


584
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,086
in the authoring tool.


585
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,476
Alright. So that's
the authoring tool.


586
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,886
Let's talk a little
bit about the API.


587
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:43,366
We're just going to
touch on this briefly.


588
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:46,796
So Apple News offers
a RESTful HTTP API.


589
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:49,346
This is great for medium
to large publishers


590
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:50,776
with existing CMS'
that they want


591
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,796
to plug directly
into Apple News.


592
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:58,016
It provides functions like read,
list, create, update, search,


593
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:01,436
and also offers plug in support.


594
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:04,266
So if you want to
know more about this,


595
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:06,966
if you have specific questions
or are having issues getting set


596
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,916
up with the Apple News
API, please attend the labs


597
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,866
that we have a lab today, and we
also have one on Friday as well.


598
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,916
We'll have Apple News
engineers on hand


599
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,456
to answer any questions
you might have.


600
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,936
Alright. Third, let's
talk about plug-ins,


601
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:22,696
the third way you can get
content into Apple News.


602
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,096
So WordPress is one of
the plug-ins we offer.


603
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:28,516
We actually offer
several of them,


604
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:31,416
and the published Apple News
plug in is a really easy way


605
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,666
to publish articles directly
into News from WordPress.


606
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,046
It's also one of the most
popular integrations we


607
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:37,656
have today.


608
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,546
And so this is what it
looks like in WordPress.


609
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:44,346
As a, WordPress is a nice
simple authoring interface,


610
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:47,496
and there's an Apple News
section off to the right side


611
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,286
that gives you many
features you need to publish


612
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:51,636
in Apple News including
choosing which section,


613
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:54,056
adding a pull quote,
and, and other features.


614
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,376
So it's really simple
and very integrated.


615
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,806
We also support publishing
directly from Drupal,


616
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,326
which is a content
management software system


617
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:07,636
that many websites that you
use every day are powered by.


618
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:10,296
And so you can publish directly
from Drupal and Apple News.


619
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:15,886
And today we also announced that
Craft cms is also integrating


620
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:17,926
with Apple News, and
you can publish directly


621
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:18,696
from their system.


622
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:19,966
It's very exciting.


623
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:23,276
And then next, I'm really
thrilled to announce


624
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:26,816
in this session that we have a
brand-new Apple News integration


625
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,296
with Squarespace.


626
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:33,736
And so Squarespace,
as you guys know,


627
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:36,206
helps anyone build
beautiful websites online.


628
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:40,986
The Apple News integration lets
Squarespace customers really


629
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,866
seamlessly publish into Apple
News and share their brand


630
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:46,736
with the world, and, of
course, because of Squarespace,


631
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:48,846
it's really beautiful
and easy to use.


632
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,016
So, it's a really
exciting integration.


633
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:52,966
We're thrilled to, to
have them on board.


634
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:57,646
So integrations of these four
platforms make it really easy


635
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,686
to publish into Apple News using
the tools you already use every


636
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:01,406
day instantly.


637
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:02,986
So I really urge
you to go check them


638
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:03,886
out if you use any of these.


639
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,086
So next let's talk about
making money off your articles


640
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:10,186
and channels in News.


641
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:14,436
So News makes it really easy
to generate revenue using ads.


642
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,486
Now as a publisher,
you're able to sell ads


643
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,496
in a few key places
-- in your channel,


644
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:23,516
in articles, and
between articles.


645
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:25,846
And so one of the great
things about monetizing


646
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,436
in Apple News are
the business terms.


647
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,706
So if you sell your own ads,


648
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:31,956
you get to keep 100
percent of the revenue.


649
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,136
And for the inventory
that you didn't sell,


650
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:39,956
you can have Apple backfill, and
keep 70 percent of the revenue.


651
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:46,026
So it's a, a really great,
a great way to make money.


652
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:50,116
One note, though, is that ads
in Apple News are only available


653
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:53,976
for articles delivered
by API at this time.


654
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,996
So a quick look at
some of the ad formats


655
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,086
that are available
in News today.


656
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:04,676
So we've got standard, we've got
double, we have large ad format,


657
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,976
mrects in articles,
interstitial.


658
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,136
This is when you're swiping


659
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,526
between articles
in your channel.


660
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:16,596
We also have sponsored
native ads.


661
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:21,336
And then video ads, if
you have video content,


662
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,316
and this is what they
look like on iPad.


663
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,976
So they're really simple, and
they really enhance the content.


664
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:29,336
So a few things to think


665
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:31,986
about when you're
monetizing and using ads.


666
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,576
Avoid some common mistakes.


667
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,546
Keeping, keeping an
eye on the settings


668
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,196
that you have for your ads.


669
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:42,766
If, for example, you've booked
a campaign for, for double ads,


670
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,656
and you have mrects
in your articles.


671
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,026
Those, obviously, aren't going
to deliver, and so you want


672
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,746
to make sure that you're not
making any little mistakes


673
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,816
like that.


674
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:54,446
You also should enable backfill
where you're not planning


675
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,716
on selling ads, but you should
really sell your own ads


676
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:57,216
if you can.


677
00:30:57,596 --> 00:30:59,746
That's the best way to
make money in News today.


678
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,906
Also, we also give
you the ability


679
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:08,276
to exclude certain categories
of ads in your channel,


680
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,536
but if you exclude too
many, you're going to end


681
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,376
up with too low of an ad
supply, and so only exclude


682
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:17,546
where you need to so you don't
cut yourself out of revenue.


683
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:21,426
You can also experiment
with larger ad formats.


684
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,546
We found out the larger ad
formats have much higher


685
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,336
click-through rates.


686
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,676
So think about things
like the interstitial ads.


687
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,176
And then consider video
free role if you're finding


688
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,456
that users are engaging
with your video content.


689
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:36,116
And so we have a tool that's
made for managing your ads


690
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:37,466
which is called Workbench.


691
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,326
And so you can do a couple
main things with this.


692
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,166
First, you can monitor
the News revenue


693
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,506
for the campaigns you
already have set up.


694
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,316
It's really easy to keep
an eye on things there,


695
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,256
and you can also
set up campaigns.


696
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,066
You can book, manage, report


697
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:53,226
on individual campaigns
right from Workbench.


698
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:55,706
It's a really simple
and intuitive tool.


699
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,536
Next, analytics and insight.


700
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:03,576
So we offer powerful
analytics tools in News.


701
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,336
Once you've started
delivering articles,


702
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,196
you can get some great insight


703
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,816
on how your content
is performing,


704
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:10,536
which articles are doing
better than others,


705
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,116
how your traffic
looks like over time.


706
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,616
It's a really great
exclusive tool


707
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,186
for Apple News Format
Publishers.


708
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,636
We offer a dashboard that gives
you great at-a-glance insight


709
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,986
on the content performance,
and if you're a power user,


710
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,746
you can download the
raw data via CSV,


711
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,026
but Apple News Format only.


712
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,516
This is what the analytics
dashboard looks like.


713
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,366
This is a view of channel data,


714
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:38,246
and so you can see these are
how many unique viewers this


715
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:42,846
particular channel has over
the course of a few days.


716
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,566
So it's a really nice,
rich way to get a, a,


717
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,506
some sense at a glance of
how your channel's doing.


718
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:50,686
You can even see at
the bottom we have a,


719
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:54,006
a list of the best performing
articles in a given channel,


720
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,166
which you can sort
by several vectors.


721
00:32:57,806 --> 00:33:01,776
And here's a chart for,
for a specific article,


722
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:04,996
and so this one shows shares
for a given day, and you can see


723
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:07,056
that they're split up
based upon share method.


724
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,896
So you can really get a sense if
your users' sharing via Facebook


725
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:12,076
or Twitter or messages or mail,


726
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,056
and that can help you
reach out to them.


727
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:19,376
And then, of course, if you have
an existing analytics platform,


728
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:22,466
and you want to pull the
data from Apple News into it,


729
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,156
you can download the CSV


730
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,826
from the analytics tab
right from News Publisher.


731
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:34,306
So we've talked about a lot of
different vectors of Apple News.


732
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,306
Let's talk a little bit


733
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,496
about how you can make
your content successful


734
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,406
in Apple News.


735
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,886
So there are lots of ways
you can drive readers


736
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:42,516
to your channel.


737
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:45,216
We're going to cover
three main ones right now.


738
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,516
So, first, you, you want
to link to your channel


739
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:49,226
from wherever you can
and drive traffic to it.


740
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,896
Use the promoted articles
feature, which I'll show you.


741
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:57,066
And then use conical URL's,
and we'll talk about what


742
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,266
that is in a minute, too.


743
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,466
And, in addition, we have a link
at the end of the presentation


744
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,356
to our Marketing
Guidelines page.


745
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,606
There's lots of information
about how you can,


746
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,016
can promote your
channel outside of News.


747
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,286
So getting the word out about
your channel is critical,


748
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:15,496
and make it really easy to
get the link to your channel,


749
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,326
you just go into News Publisher
under the channel info tab,


750
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,085
see that there's a
shared link link.


751
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:22,886
So you click on that, and
it brings up a dialogue


752
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:23,946
where you can just
copy your link


753
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,485
and then share it
with the world.


754
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:30,335
So we also have a
promoted articles features,


755
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,025
and so what this does is
when you promote an article,


756
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:35,896
it will ensure that every user
sees that article at the top


757
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:37,356
of your channel when
they visit it.


758
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:40,326
And then when they come back,
that article will start to move


759
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:43,045
down as you deliver more
articles, but it will ensure


760
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,795
that everyone sees it at the top
of your channel at least once.


761
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:50,076
And it also, make sure it
appears in the more from section


762
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,565
at the bottom of articles
that you delivered.


763
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:56,976
You can promote up to
three articles per section.


764
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:58,976
It's really easy to promote.


765
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:03,756
You just click on the little
star next to an article,


766
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:08,006
and then it moves up to the
promoted articles section


767
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,026
in News Publisher.


768
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:11,386
So you can always see what you
have promoted at a given time.


769
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:15,506
So a great way to add some
visibility to certain articles.


770
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,386
Alright. So, finally,
conical URL's.


771
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,856
It's really easy
to share in News.


772
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,396
You can just swipe
and tap to share.


773
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:25,356
In iOS10, we've made
it even easier.


774
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,106
You can, we have a share
icon on every single article.


775
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:30,996
So users will be sharing a
lot, and you want to make sure


776
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,916
that users can get to your,
your articles no matter


777
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,036
which platform they're on.


778
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,276
And so conical URL's are
essentially a link back


779
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:40,806
to your original website.


780
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:45,116
So if you have a website, and a
user shares an Apple.News link,


781
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:48,626
if you included a conical URL
when you delivered your article,


782
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:52,706
if a user visits that link on
a Mac or other non-iOS device,


783
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:56,166
it will redirect them to Safari
to your original web page.


784
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,876
So it's a great way to make sure


785
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,546
that users can read your
articles no matter what platform


786
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,936
they're on.


787
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,026
And so it falls back
if you're on non-iOS.


788
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,816
And this is an example
of an Apple.News link,


789
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,236
and then its accompanying
conical URL.


790
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:17,036
If you don't have a conical
URL, users will see this screen,


791
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:19,036
which isn't an ideal screen.


792
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,706
And so if you do have a website,


793
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,986
you should include
your conical URL


794
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:26,906
so users can view
it on any platform.


795
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:30,346
Alright. So some of the
best practices overall


796
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,086
for publishing in Apple News.


797
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,836
Write great stuff.


798
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:37,546
Try to check for errors and
typos and things like that.


799
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:40,216
If you have errors or
problems with your text,


800
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:41,616
it makes it harder
for us to classify


801
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,836
and then recommend it to users.


802
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:46,316
So really make sure you're
writing the best quality


803
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:46,706
you can.


804
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:50,156
Deliver high-resolution
images and use galleries.


805
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,946
Nothing drives engagement
like great visual content.


806
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:57,166
Use Rich Text and pull quotes,
animations and parallax.


807
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,706
Anything else that Apple
News Format lets you do


808
00:36:58,706 --> 00:36:59,676
and be creative.


809
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,546
There are so many interesting
cool tools you can use.


810
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,156
Dig around in the documentation,
and see what else you can do.


811
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:08,856
We really recommend that you
spend some time creating great,


812
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,616
great articles.


813
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:12,856
And then use Apple.News
when linking,


814
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,686
but use conical URL's
when you can.


815
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:18,376
And then we also recommend
having a somewhat consistent


816
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:21,936
publishing cadence so
users know what to expect


817
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,856
if you're publishing
on a regular basis.


818
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,136
They'll come back
to your channel


819
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:26,346
on a regular basis as well.


820
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:32,676
And so Apple News is very much
an Apple app, and we love great,


821
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,686
beautiful, and inspired stories,
and we have many actual humans


822
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:40,286
on the Apple News team, the
editorial team who go through


823
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:43,046
and look for amazing
Apple News format content.


824
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,876
They're looking for the
best stuff to feature,


825
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,886
and so we encourage you to
be creative and ambitious


826
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:48,806
with what you publish,


827
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:51,556
and if you're doing great
engaging Apple News Format


828
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:54,356
stories, our editors may notice,
and they might promote you


829
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,436
and help you find
the new audience


830
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,006
that you wouldn't
have otherwise found.


831
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,886
So a few places we do
this are in top stories,


832
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:03,826
in our new Featured
Story section in iOS 10,


833
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:08,556
in the Explore tab, in the
recommended widget, and for you.


834
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,656
We also have an Apple News
Twitter account where we tweet


835
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,766
out some of the best articles


836
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,166
that have been published
throughout the day,


837
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,466
and then we have a weekly
e-mail that we send out to many,


838
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:21,026
many users, and it's another
great venue to be discovered.


839
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,786
So some homework to do.


840
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,946
So first you want to sign
up for Apple News Format,


841
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,296
create a channel, and then start
publishing articles using either


842
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:36,196
your CMS via the Apple News API,
download and set up a plug in,


843
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,646
or you can author
in News Publisher.


844
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,256
So this is more information
about some of the links


845
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,366
and other places
in, in this link.


846
00:38:50,186 --> 00:38:53,656
And then there's also a
related session on Friday.


847
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,356
This is an amazing session
dedicated to teaching you how


848
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:59,426
to create incredible Apple
News Format articles.


849
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,996
So I can't recommend this
session highly enough.


850
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,026
Casey and Dan will help
you make standout stories


851
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:07,566
that really engage and
delight your users.


852
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:08,596
They use some really cool stuff.


853
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,616
So I highly recommend
checking this one out.


854
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:12,786
So thanks, and I hope you're
having a great time at WWDC.


855
