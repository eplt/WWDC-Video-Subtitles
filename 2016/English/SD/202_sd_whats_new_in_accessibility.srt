[ Music ]


2
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:20,656
>> Hi everyone.


3
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,246
I'm Conor Hughes, an engineer


4
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,746
on the Accessibility
Team here at Apple.


5
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:26,086
And welcome to What's
New in Accessibility.


6
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:29,166
Today we're going to learn about
some cool new assistive features


7
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,746
in our operating systems and
learn about what you need


8
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,776
to know to make sure your
apps are usable by everyone.


9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,166
So let's get started.


10
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,116
So accessibility is a big word


11
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:40,316
and many are not
familiar with it.


12
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,286
What does it mean?


13
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:44,636
To us, accessibility means
making a system usable


14
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:47,216
for everyone, with all
of their unique needs.


15
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,316
This means both designing
in accommodations for people


16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,166
with different needs
and being careful


17
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,056
about your basic
design to avoid issues.


18
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,886
This being WWDC, we're going
to focus on accessibility


19
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,856
on Apple platforms
where we're concerned


20
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,436
with four major classes
of ability: Motor,


21
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,775
vision, hearing and learning.


22
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,666
Motor encompasses
things like Parkinson's


23
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,446
and Multiple Sclerosis and
affects things like the ability


24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,646
to push with force on the screen
or accurately tap targets.


25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,316
Vision accommodations
encompass both blindness


26
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,596
and partial vision loss.


27
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,626
Hearing covers hearing
loss of various gradations.


28
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:27,686
And learning, which includes
things like dyslexia and autism.


29
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:31,266
Our operating systems can do a
lot to provide accommodations


30
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,356
in all of these areas.


31
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,466
But apps are a core part of
our platform experiences.


32
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,236
So for our platforms to be
truly accessible environments,


33
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,216
we need you to make sure your
apps are accessible as well,


34
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,626
which is why we're so happy
that you're here to learn


35
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:44,866
about how to do just that.


36
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:47,016
So let's go over what we're
going to talk about today.


37
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,926
First we'll go over some of
the new assistive features


38
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:52,916
in Mac OS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS


39
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,316
so you can see some
concrete examples


40
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,566
of how software can
provide accommodations


41
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,666
for people with different needs.


42
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,906
Then we'll take an iOS app
as our example and audit it


43
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,116
for accessibility issues.


44
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,566
Then dig into the
APIs that you can use


45
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,336
to make sure your
apps are accessible.


46
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,376
And finally, we'll
use those APIs


47
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,516
to fix the issues we
identified in our audit,


48
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:16,626
including using some new API
we think you're going to love.


49
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,046
So what new assistive features
do we have to show this year?


50
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,386
Well, there are quite a few, so
let's go through and take a look


51
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:24,736
at what's new in
each major area.


52
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,436
First off, motor.


53
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:32,476
So some people may only be able
to interact with their devise


54
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,186
through pressing a
single physical button,


55
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,896
for instance a switch on
a wheelchair headrest.


56
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:40,096
They can interact with the
rich touch interface of iOS,


57
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,946
for instance, through Switch
Control, which presents a cursor


58
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,156
which moves through the
interface elements on screen.


59
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,966
When someone wants to
interact with the element


60
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,926
under the cursor, they
press their switch.


61
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,326
Switch Control lets people with
motor disabilities do everything


62
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,596
from simple taps to
complex gestures.


63
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,646
iOS and OS X have had Switch
Control for several years.


64
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,176dle
So what's new?


65
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,176
So what's new?


66
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,946
Well, we're excited to announce


67
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:05,066
that we're bringing
Switch Control to tvOS.


68
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,646
Now, people who use
Switch Control can use it


69
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,916
to directly interact
with the tvOS interface.


70
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,886
The familiar Switch interface
is available with that cursor


71
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,216
that highlights elements
onscreen.


72
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,256
Or an alternative
interface is available


73
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,306
with an onscreen remote.


74
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,786
And what's more,
people can do this


75
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,306
without repairing their switch.


76
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,166
Someone using Switch
Control on their iOS device


77
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,656
or their Mac can immediately
start controlling their TV


78
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,496
totally autonomously
without any external help.


79
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,456
We think this is a
huge improvement.


80
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:36,966
And we can't wait for
people to try it out.


81
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,426
Next up, Dwell Control.


82
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,886
There are a number of
assistive technologies


83
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,226
that track someone's focus when
they're using their computer.


84
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,996
So they may take the form
of tracking a reflective dot


85
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:48,696
on a headband, or actually
tracking eye movements.


86
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,816
Dwell Control is a
new feature in Mac OS,


87
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,586
which integrates
support for these devices


88
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,256
by allowing them to
control the mouse.


89
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,926
When the mouse dwells
on a certain location,


90
00:03:58,556 --> 00:03:59,956
Dwell Control presents
a timer [inaudible].


91
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,826
And when a timer expires,
it invokes an action,


92
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,886
for instance a mouse click.


93
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,266
This allows someone to control
their Mac without having


94
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,376
to manipulate the mouse.


95
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:11,036
And of course, it's customizable
with custom actions,


96
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,156
just like Switch Control.


97
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,176
So next, let's look at vision.


98
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,745
So, for many years Mac OS and
iOS have supported features


99
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,315
like invert colors
and gray scale


100
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,526
to help people increase
the contrast of the content


101
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,926
on their device, deal
with light sensitivity


102
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,186
or work around color issues.


103
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,636
This year we're expanding
that support


104
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,116
across Mac OS, iOS and tvOS.


105
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,706
We've added color
adjustments to help people


106
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,476
with color blindness, which
can help something that appears


107
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,966
like this, appear
more like this.


108
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,366
And we've also added the ability


109
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,366
to tint the entire
display a certain color,


110
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,546
which can significantly increase
reading ability in people


111
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:52,776
who find reading black
on white text difficult.


112
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:56,026
So in watchOS, someone using
VoiceOver can have the time


113
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,196
spoken aloud to them
by raising their wrist


114
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,336
or tapping on the watch face.


115
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,356
But sometimes they may want
to discretely check the time


116
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,116
without disturbing
those around them.


117
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,546
So in watchOS 3 we're
introducing Taptic Time.


118
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,006
Taptic Time is a VoiceOver
feature that uses a series


119
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,956
of distinct taps from
the Taptic engine


120
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:15,096
to help someone tell time
silently and discretely.


121
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:20,276
So iOS has a lot of
features that help people


122
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,596
with visual disabilities
discover and interact


123
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,816
with the content
on their device.


124
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,766
But what about their
physical environment?


125
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:29,106
In iOS X we're introducing
a feature called Magnifier.


126
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,986
Magnifier is available
from anywhere in iOS.


127
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,356
And it lets someone use
their device's camera


128
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:36,496
to magnify objects in
their physical environment.


129
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,886
And I'd love to show
that to you now.


130
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,716
Okay, so I'm going to
turn on Magnifier by going


131
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:51,626
into Settings, General,
Accessibility, Magnifier


132
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,596
and flipping the switch.


133
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,346
Now I can turn on Magnifier


134
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:56,726
by just triple clicking
the Home button.


135
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,066
So here we are.


136
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,916
So, if I want to read what's
on this bottle of medicine,


137
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,846
for instance, I can
just zoom in quite far.


138
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,146
I have access to things
like the camera torch


139
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:10,896
for a low light environment.


140
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,766
I can lock focus on a
certain focal length.


141
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,586
And in case I have trouble
keeping the device steady,


142
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,396
or I'm pointing at
something far away,


143
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:23,416
I can take a freeze frame
here with the Center button.


144
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,926
And we captured this image


145
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,566
at the device's native camera
resolution, so we can zoom


146
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,286
out and in, move around.


147
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:33,336
And Magnifier also supports
various color filters


148
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,166
to help someone increase
the contrast.


149
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,976
So for instance, maybe
I find this grayscale,


150
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:42,696
maybe inverted grayscale,
increase the contrast a bit.


151
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,586
So that's pretty
easy for me to read.


152
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:48,186
Okay, so that's an example
of Magnifier on iOS X.


153
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,596
Okay, so what's new in hearing?


154
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,696
iOS has supported hardware
TTY devices for some time.


155
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,676
TTY technology allows
someone with hearing loss


156
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,956
to hold text conversations
over standard telephone calls.


157
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,556
Here is what an existing
TTY machine looks like.


158
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:05,956
As you can see, it's
fairly large


159
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,966
and probably difficult
to carry around.


160
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,646
But it's incredibly important
for someone who's deaf,


161
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,906
especially when you factor in
relay operators who translate


162
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:17,146
from TTY to voice, allowing
someone using this machine


163
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,116
to contact businesses,
services and family and friends


164
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:20,936
who may not be using one.


165
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,476
We thought it would be
great if the functionality


166
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,216
of this device was
available to everyone


167
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,656
without any additional hardware.


168
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,386
So new in iOS X anyone can
play software TTY phone calls


169
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,236
in a familiar interface
without having


170
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,436
to use any additional hardware.


171
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,156
These calls work with legacy
TTY technology and make it easy


172
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,286
to dial a non-TTY number through
your carrier's relay service.


173
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:43,896
Plus, it has built


174
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,356
in TTY-specific quick type
predictions so it fits


175
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,206
in with existing
TTY user culture.


176
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:50,656
And finally, learning.


177
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:54,766
Dyslexia is an incredibly common
learning disability affecting


178
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,716
the ability to read
and write of millions


179
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:57,576
of people around the world.


180
00:07:58,246 --> 00:08:00,276
In iOS X we're excited
to bring a number


181
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,476
of enhancements designed to
help people with dyslexia.


182
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,606
We've implemented
improvements to Speak Selection


183
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:08,656
and Speak Screen to help people
better understand the text


184
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,506
that's already been entered.


185
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,216
And we've implemented new
audio feedback for typing


186
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,936
to help people immediately
catch mistakes.


187
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:16,136
And I'd love to show
that you now.


188
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:19,716
Okay, so I've turned on typing
feedback features already


189
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,016
in Accessibility
Speech Settings.


190
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,366
So I'll just fire up Notes.


191
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,296
And what I'm going to
do here is I'm going


192
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,906
to type the word
Welcome and I'm going


193
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,496
to pause after typing the O.


194
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:29,896
And I've turned on
Character Feedback


195
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:33,306
where iOS will read the last
character that I typed back


196
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,236
to me after a pause
so I can be sure


197
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,476
that I didn't enter a visually
similar character like an E.


198
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:41,655
>> E.


199
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,216
>> So, it may be difficult
to hear a little bit,


200
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,666
but iOS just read
back an E to me.


201
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,186
So that wasn't correct.


202
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:50,986
>> O.


203
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:55,016
>> Great. Now, I'm going
to keep typing, excuse me,


204
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:58,006
and iOS is going to read
back each word to me,


205
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,566
because I've turned
on Word Feedback.


206
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,046
So I can get immediate feedback


207
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:03,476
as to whether the word I've
entered is the one I wanted.


208
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:10,096
>> Welcome to our session.


209
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,316
>> Okay. So that's
a quick example


210
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:16,976
of enhanced typing
feedback in iOS X.


211
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,356
So, hopefully I've whetted
your appetite as to the kinds


212
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:23,096
of accommodations
software can provide


213
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,296
to make sure the entire
experience is accessible


214
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:25,766
to everyone.


215
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,516
So if you're new
to accessibility,


216
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,166
you may be wondering about
how you can put similar


217
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,476
accommodations into your apps.


218
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,006
And if you've used the
accessibilities APIs before,


219
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,316
maybe it's time for a quick
refresher before we jump


220
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,146
onto some new API.


221
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:40,246
So, how do we use the
accessibility APIs


222
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,536
to make sure our
apps are accessible?


223
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,376
Well, the first step is to
audit our app for accessibility.


224
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,296
Traditionally, the best way
to do this was just to fire


225
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,686
up an assistive app like
VoiceOver or Switch Control


226
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,476
and see what happened.


227
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,216
You'll want to check that
all your interface items


228
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:54,856
are exposed.


229
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,196
That everything that is
exposed has a good label


230
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,506
so someone using
VoiceOver can identify it.


231
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:03,406
You'll want to check that
someone using your app


232
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,786
with VoiceOver can do everything
that any other use can do.


233
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:09,706
And finally, you're designing
the accessible experience


234
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:10,136
for your app.


235
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,286
So you'll want to make sure
that someone using your app


236
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,566
with VoiceOver, for
instance, has just as great


237
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,496
and smooth an experience
as anyone else.


238
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,596
So this year we're also excited


239
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,266
that there's a brand new
accessibility inspector that's a


240
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,736
lot of more powerful and
can help you immediately


241
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:25,486
catch mistakes.


242
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,406
If you want to learn more about
this inspector I encourage you


243
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:32,096
to check out the
session Auditing your App


244
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,706
for Accessibility on Wednesday
to learn more about it.


245
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:38,356
For this session we're going to
focus on auditing with VoiceOver


246
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,636
because it's still the best
way to get intimately familiar


247
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,536
with accessibility
of your app's flows.


248
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,846
Okay, so let's do it.


249
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,216
Let's take a look at a live app


250
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,656
and find its accessibility
issues.


251
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:51,856
So, for this presentation
I'm going to be using iOS,


252
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,636
but the same basic flow
applies to all of our platforms.


253
00:10:56,176 --> 00:11:01,806
Okay, so the first thing I'm
going to do is add VoiceOver


254
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:04,476
to my accessibility
triple-click shortcut by going


255
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,836
into Accessibility Settings.


256
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:07,356
And all the way at the bottom,


257
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,916
Accessibility Shortcut,
turn on VoiceOver.


258
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,296
Okay, so let's fire up
our app now, DogRoutePro,


259
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:16,166
a pro app for selecting
routes to walk your dog.


260
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,016
And turn on VoiceOver


261
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:19,736
by triple-clicking the Home
button and Select again.


262
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,206
>> VoiceOver on.


263
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,716
DogRoutePro.


264
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:23,326
Routes.


265
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,816
>> So, there are two, excuse
me, there are two ways


266
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,736
to navigate your app
when VoiceOver's on.


267
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,626
You can take one finger
and pan around on screen


268
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:31,706
and VoiceOver will select


269
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:32,926
and read what's underneath
your finger.


270
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,296
Or you can swipe with one
finger, right or left,


271
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,556
to move forward or back
through the list of elements.


272
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,826
So let's see how accessible
these table cells are.


273
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,516
>> Avenue Loop.


274
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,126
0.8 miles.


275
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,966
>> So, immediately I
noticed that I know


276
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:49,776
that if you activate this cell,
we can go somewhere on our app.


277
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,416
But nothing conveys that
to a VoiceOver user.


278
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,956
Let's keep going.


279
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:56,556
>> [Inaudible] button.


280
00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:00,046
>> So this button has a label
that's derived from the name


281
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:03,046
of the image I used
to initialize it.


282
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,136
That's the framework's
falling back


283
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,576
on the only information
I gave it.


284
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,026
So we'll have to give
it a better label.


285
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,156
All right.


286
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:10,216
So let's activate this cell.


287
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,956
To activate an item
with VoiceOver,


288
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,656
when the item is
selected you'll want


289
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,336
to double-tap onscreen
with one finger.


290
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,466
>> Avenue Loop.


291
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,536
0 -- Avenue Loop.


292
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,986
Routes. Back button.


293
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:21,956
>> Okay, let's go
through this UI.


294
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,886
>> Avenue Loop.


295
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:25,176
Avenue Loop ratings.


296
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,986
Heading. Distractions.


297
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,126
Smells. Greenery.


298
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:29,666
Friends.


299
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,396
>> So for this ratings graph,


300
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,506
the graph values are
totally inaccessible


301
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:34,586
to someone using voiceover.


302
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,526
Let's keep going.


303
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,816
>> Avenue Loop route.


304
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,926
Heading. Broadway and Ridgeway.


305
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,906
Hazard. Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.


306
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,616
41st and Broadway.


307
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:49,046
>> So, because I gave these
annotations good titles,


308
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:52,726
the frameworks were able to use
that as the accessibility label


309
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,076
for the map annotations.


310
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,126
So that's good.


311
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,276
Let's move on to this Steps tab.


312
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,186
>> Steps. Text selected.


313
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:01,106
Step 41st.


314
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,716
-- Broadway and Ridgeway.


315
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,826
Turn right at Broadway
and Ridgeway.


316
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,886
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.


317
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,086
Boys' Choir between Gilbert
and Montgomery on Ridgeway.


318
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,996
Continue along Ridgeway.


319
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,256
Be careful of cars and children.


320
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,576
>> So, VoiceOver was
able to read all the text


321
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,576
in these table view cells.


322
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,206
But you'll notice that these
cells that represent hazards


323
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,396
on the route are not
differentiated at all


324
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:28,616
for someone using VoiceOver even
though a sighted user can see


325
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,086
that there are hazards from the
red text and distinctive icon.


326
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,886
Okay, let's jump
out to the slides


327
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,366
and discuss how we
can fix these issues.


328
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,286
So, what did we learn
about our app?


329
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,296
First, those route list cells.


330
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,346
The Favorite button has that
odd label that's derived


331
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:46,576
from the name of the
image we're using.


332
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,556
In addition, it isn't clear


333
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,066
that the table cell itself can
be activated to go somewhere.


334
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,666
Now, for the ratings graph,


335
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,956
those graph values were totally
inaccessible to VoiceOver.


336
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:04,696
And finally, in the route step
list the cells representing


337
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,326
waypoints that were hazards
are not differentiated


338
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,426
from the other steps
on the route.


339
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,076
So how can we fix
these problems?


340
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,526
Well, to understand how, we need


341
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:17,136
to understand how VoiceOver
is able to access information


342
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,296
from our interface and drive it.


343
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,416
VoiceOver interacts with our app


344
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,076
through the UIAccessibility
protocol.


345
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,466
So let's take, as an
example, that Favorite button


346
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,846
in the app we just saw.


347
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,596
Assistive apps like
VoiceOver need


348
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:33,356
to ask your app's user
interface items questions.


349
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,156
So for instance, when Voiceover
is on and someone touches


350
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,666
that button, VoiceOver
asks the button, "Hey,


351
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,716
what kind of thing are you?"


352
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,906
And the button says,
"Well, I'm a button."


353
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,546
VoiceOver then asks,
"Who are you?


354
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:45,186
What's your name?"


355
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:49,006
That button should respond
with something like "Favorite."


356
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,536
Finally VoiceOver asks,
"Where are you on screen?"


357
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,036
And the button replies with
"Its screen space frame."


358
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,886
This is the information
VoiceOver needs to announce,


359
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,826
"Favorite, Button" and draw
a cursor around the element.


360
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,326
So these messages from
assistive technologies


361
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,596
to your app take the form
of method invocations.


362
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:09,376
The methods are all part of
the UIAccessibility protocol.


363
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,866
By implementing the methods


364
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,846
of this protocol you
make your custom view


365
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,896
hierarchies accessible.


366
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:17,766
So standard UI controls
have accessibility baked in.


367
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,106
But depending on how you
configure them, you may need


368
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,836
to set or override
certain properties.


369
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,076
So what properties?


370
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:23,846
Let's take a look.


371
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,966
Now, there are a lot of methods
on the UIAccessibility protocol


372
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,916
that you can use for
fine-grained control


373
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,226
over how your interface
items expose themselves


374
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:32,916
to accessibility.


375
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:34,346
But for most work you need


376
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,906
to only concern yourself
with a few.


377
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,826
Let's go through the basic
properties one by one.


378
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,166
First, there's
isAccessibilityElement.


379
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,006
This property determines if
an interface item is serviced


380
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,456
by an assistive technology
at all.


381
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,126
So for instance, if you have
an image view that's background


382
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,746
decoration, you can
leave this as False.


383
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:54,916
However, if it represents a
photo that someone uploaded


384
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,356
to your service, you'll
want to set this to True


385
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,446
so someone using VoiceOver
can discover the image,


386
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,486
focus on it and learn about it.


387
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,226
So now your interface element
is surfaced by VoiceOver.


388
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,856
You'll want to give it a name
so that users can identify it.


389
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,696
That's what the accessibility
label is for.


390
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,616
The label is a concise
identifier of the element.


391
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,326
For instance Send
Message or New Alarm.


392
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:21,496
So how does someone know that
they can activate your element?


393
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:25,306
New Alarm doesn't convey
that the item is a button


394
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,326
in the same way that its
visual styling might.


395
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,556
That's where the
accessibility traits come in.


396
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:31,776
Accessibility traits declare


397
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:34,386
to the assistive technology
what your element is


398
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:35,516
and how to interact with it.


399
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,656
So for instance, a button
should have the trait


400
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,016
UIAccessibilityTraitButton.


401
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,336
An adjustable control


402
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:43,166
like a slider would
have the trait


403
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,686
UIAccessibilityTraitAdjustable.


404
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,506
The traits are a bit masked,


405
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,946
so an element could
have more than one.


406
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,276
For instance, a selected
button should have both


407
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:54,156
UIAccessibilityTraitButton and
UIAccessibiltyTraitSelected.


408
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:57,216
The Button trait is what
makes VoiceOver speak "Button"


409
00:16:57,636 --> 00:16:59,336
so someone knows they can
activate your element.


410
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:03,386
Next there's the
accessibility frame.


411
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,366
This determines where
your element is onscreen


412
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,866
and is used both for hit testing


413
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,756
and for drawing a cursor
around the element.


414
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,886
Now, for UI views you usually do
not have to set this explicitly


415
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:17,046
because it's computed for you
based on where the view is


416
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:17,806
in the view hierarchy.


417
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,455
But you can modify it if needed.


418
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,695
Just remember that it is
in screen coordinates.


419
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:26,496
And finally, there's
the accessibility value.


420
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,036
This is useful for
elements that have some sort


421
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:30,986
of conceptual value
associated with them.


422
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,366
So for instance, a slider
returns its current value


423
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,946
in percent through the
accessibility value.


424
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:38,486
An on-off switch
returns on or off.


425
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,336
And if you had some
sort of custom control


426
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:41,966
that controlled the
magnification level


427
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,886
of an instrument, you'd want to
convey that magnification level


428
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:47,016
through the accessibility value.


429
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:52,016
Okay, so what do you do
if you do custom drawing


430
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,406
where each logical piece of your
interface doesn't map directly


431
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,086
to a UI view?


432
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,776
When you need to do that,
use UIAccessibilityElement.


433
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,086
UIAccessibilityElement objects
represent logical accessible


434
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:04,946
regions onscreen.


435
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:08,006
And they interact with the
UIAccessibility protocol just


436
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,106
like your views do.


437
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,396
You can use them, for instance,
to expose each individual piece


438
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,716
of a control that's built
as a single UI view.


439
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:19,856
So to do so, make the element
whose pieces you want to expose


440
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,246
into an accessibility container


441
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,736
by setting its accessibility
elements property to an array


442
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,496
of UIAccessibilityElement
objects


443
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:29,226
that represent each
individual piece of the control.


444
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,386
So, UIAccessibilityElement
is a natural choice to expose


445
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:37,386
that graph we saw earlier where
I was doing some custom layers


446
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,786
to present the graph bars.


447
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,316
But if you're a very astute
listener you may have noticed a


448
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:42,916
slight snag.


449
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,916
UIAccessibilityElement
objects aren't views,


450
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,986
so we need to set their
accessibility frame manually.


451
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:53,876
However, those graph bars
were inside of a scroll view,


452
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,316
so their frames and
screen coordinates change.


453
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,386
Now, to rectify this
we could subclass,


454
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,746
or we could set accessibility
frame after each scroll.


455
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,806
Or, in iOS X we can
set accessibility frame


456
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:06,806
in container space.


457
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,676
When you set this property to
a container-relative frame,


458
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:14,816
UIAccessibilityElement will
automatically follow its


459
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,236
container's position onscreen.


460
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,446
So those are the
most basic methods


461
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,016
in the UIAccessibility
protocol along


462
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,216
with UIAccessibilityElement.


463
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,196
And you'll get most of the
way there with just those.


464
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:26,536
So what are the takeaways?


465
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,806
First, know that the methods


466
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,646
in UIAccessibility protocol are
how you expose your interface


467
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,606
items to accessibility.


468
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,456
Through the methods of this
protocol your app answers


469
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,796
questions about what
its interface items are


470
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,096
and what they can do.


471
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,226
Now, for many classes
support is baked in,


472
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,146
so there's nothing
for you to do.


473
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,436
But you may need to set
or override properties


474
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,166
to get the behavior you need.


475
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,856
Finally, if you have
pieces of your interface


476
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,216
that don't map directly
to views,


477
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,176
use UIAccessibilityElement.


478
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,996
So, let's go in and use
what we just learned


479
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,016
to make our app accessible.


480
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:01,486
The first thing we're
going to do is we're going


481
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:05,106
to fix the fact that that
table view cell didn't convey


482
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:07,756
that it was able to be
activated through VoiceOver.


483
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,386
So, the way we're going to do
that is, in its AwakeFromNib,


484
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,236
all we're going to do is "Or"


485
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:15,546
in the trait
UIAccessibilityTraitButton.


486
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,656
Done. All right, now
let's fix the label


487
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:20,676
for that Favorite button.


488
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:25,616
What we're going to do here
is when we set the route


489
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:28,426
for this cell we're going
to grab the Favorite button


490
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:32,796
and set its accessibility
label property to say Favorite


491
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:33,886
and then the name of the route.


492
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,526
I'm putting the name
of the route in there


493
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,466
so it's unambiguous which
route I'm going to Favorite


494
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,516
if I activate that button.


495
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:45,166
All right, let's move
on to that graph we saw.


496
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:49,216
So, like I said, I'm doing
some drawing here with layers.


497
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:51,516
So we're going to use
UIAccessibilityElement.


498
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,906
Now, what I want to do
here is first I'm going


499
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,466
to add some ivars to keep track


500
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,236
of the UIAccessibilityElement
objects.


501
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,636
So, just four ivars, one
for each bar of the graph


502
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,556
that are
UAAccessibiliytElements.


503
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,326
Next I'll add a short
little helper function


504
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,226
to help me translate
from a numeric rating


505
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,586
into a user-friendly string.


506
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,706
So, rated X of 5.


507
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:17,796
And then, for each of
these didSet callbacks


508
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:20,116
for these rating
properties I'm going


509
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,846
to set the accessibility value


510
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:26,406
of the appropriate accessibility
element to a friendly string


511
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,286
that describes the rating.


512
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,806
So, for smells -- oops.


513
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,246
Put distractions first.


514
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,526
Smells. Greenery.


515
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,076
And friends.


516
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,076
So again, just grabbing
the correct element,


517
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,776
setting its accessibility value


518
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,916
to be the value string
for the rating.


519
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,046
Okay, now we need to
actually set the ivars


520
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:51,566
to be valid accessibility
elements.


521
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:58,196
So in AwakeFromNib here, for
those four ivars I'm just going


522
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,816
to set it equal to a
UIAccessibilityElement


523
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,466
with our self as the
accessibility container.


524
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:06,516
Now, we're going to set the
labels for these elements


525
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:10,916
to just be the text from the
label that's already there,


526
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,246
the UI label, I should
say, that's already there.


527
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,466
And then finally, we'll set
the accessibility properties


528
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,366
of our self, because we want to
be an accessibility container,


529
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,166
to just be those four elements.


530
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:25,036
So now we have valid
accessibility element objects


531
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,476
with a valid label,
or a good label,


532
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,076
and a good accessibility value.


533
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:30,826
Now we just need
to set their frame.


534
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,586
So what we're going to
do is when we're laying


535
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:40,456
out the graph bars, we'll
just grab the appropriate


536
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,176
accessibility element and
set its accessibility frame


537
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:44,016
in container space.


538
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:49,076
Okay. Then the last thing we
needed to fix is the label


539
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,526
of the cells in the
Route List view.


540
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:56,216
So, I'll go to the
Route Step cell.


541
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,416
And when we set the
appropriate waypoint


542
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,886
that that cell represents,
what we're going


543
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:03,066
to do is add some code


544
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,986
to manually set the
accessibility label


545
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,846
to be the waypoint's name and
then the waypoint's description.


546
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,366
And then if it's a
hazard we'll add "Hazard."


547
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,056
And then the hazard description.


548
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,826
Okay, so before we build
and run this, let's go back


549
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,876
to the slides and think about
whether there's anything


550
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,406
that a sighted user
can do easily


551
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,166
that a VoiceOver user still
will have trouble with.


552
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:28,826
All right.


553
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:33,646
So again, first, that route map.


554
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:36,806
VoiceOver users can discover
the steps on the map, however,


555
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:40,246
the route order is lost because
VoiceOver is reading those


556
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:43,266
elements in a spatial,
top-down, left to right order.


557
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,916
In addition, someone who's
sighted can easily see the


558
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,006
hazards on that graph by
the distinctive icons.


559
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,456
But someone using VoiceOver will
have to navigate through all


560
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,566
of the waypoints on the graph
to discover all the hazards.


561
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:00,326
Now, for the route step list,
there's a similar problem


562
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,206
in that it's easily
skimmable for a sighted user


563
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,656
who can scroll through quickly
looking through their cells


564
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,766
with the distinctive red
text and distinctive label.


565
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,606
But for a VoiceOver user,
it's not as skimmable.


566
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,616
They have to go through
each individual cell.


567
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,486
So how can we fix these issues?


568
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:18,646
We're going to use the rotor.


569
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,836
The rotor is a VoiceOver feature
that lets someone navigate


570
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:24,536
across an interface by searching
for elements of a given type.


571
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,726
So one of the built-in
rotors, for instance,


572
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,766
is the Headings rotor,
which allows someone


573
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,746
to navigate an interface by
jumping between the headings.


574
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:35,846
To use the rotor you take two
fingers and twist onscreen


575
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,846
as though you're
manipulating a physical dial.


576
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,436
Do that to select the rotor
setting to use, and then swipe


577
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,466
up or down with one
finger to search previous


578
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,506
or next with that rotor.


579
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,636
So this year we're
introducing the ability for you


580
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,276
to add your own custom
search rotors.


581
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,206
We hope you'll take
advantage of this


582
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,796
to add a totally new
navigational power to your apps


583
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:57,576
when people are using
them with VoiceOver.


584
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:00,656
On iOS, to add your
custom rotors,


585
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:03,936
set the Accessibility Custom
Rotors property on a super view


586
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,626
that contains the elements
through which you wish


587
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,946
to search, or that super
view's view controller.


588
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,756
You'll want to set
this to an array


589
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:13,746
of view accessibility
custom rotor objects,


590
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,526
which are initialized
with a name,


591
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,536
and also an item search block
that's called each time someone


592
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:22,066
swipes up or down to
search for the previous


593
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,176
or next match to for that rotor.


594
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:28,116
All right.


595
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,456
Let's switch back over
to the demo machine


596
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,706
and see this new API in action.


597
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:40,806
Okay. So, let's first
add a Hazards rotor


598
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,586
to the Route Step
View controller


599
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,556
so someone can easily navigate
to the appropriate table cells


600
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:47,016
that represent hazards.


601
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:54,756
So, I'm going to open up the
Route Steps View controller.


602
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,816
And I'm going to set this
property inside of AwakeFromNib.


603
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:00,466
So basic skeleton here.


604
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,406
I'm going to make a Hazards
rotor an accessibility custom


605
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:05,756
rotor object with the name
Hazards and a callback.


606
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:08,596
And I'm going to set the
accessibility custom rotor's


607
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,286
property to be just that rotor.


608
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:15,286
And inside of the callback here,
the search block, I'm just going


609
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:17,306
to get our reference
to our data model here,


610
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:18,236
an array of waypoints,


611
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,586
and determine whether we're
going forwards or backwards


612
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:23,656
by inspecting the
predicate that we're passed.


613
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,326
Next, we're going to find where
we need to start our search.


614
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:29,986
So, by default, if
there is no selection


615
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:31,096
in the table view right now,


616
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,786
we're going to start
either before the first item


617
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:34,976
or after the last item,


618
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,426
depending on whether we're
going forwards or backwards.


619
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,086
So we go into the list of cells.


620
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,916
Otherwise, if we
have a current item,


621
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,706
we're going to get it as a cell.


622
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,916
And then start at the
appropriate row that represents


623
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:50,186
that item in our data model.


624
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,116
Okay. Then we're going to search


625
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:58,206
through our data model
with this loop here.


626
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:02,106
And we're going to search
until we find a match.


627
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:06,196
And a match is just a
waypoint that is a hazard.


628
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:10,886
So if we find a result, we're
going to get an index path


629
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:15,576
for that result, scroll to
that row in the table view,


630
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,916
grab the cell that we
potentially just scrolled


631
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,926
onscreen and return a
UIAccessibility custom rotor


632
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:23,676
item result with the
target element the cell.


633
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:27,066
Now, it also supports
a target range property


634
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,406
in the initializer.


635
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:32,696
If we conform to UI text input,
we could use this to rotor


636
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,526
through different
pieces of text.


637
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,036
However, we're not doing that,


638
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:37,466
so we're just going
to leave this as nil.


639
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:42,386
And if our While Loop terminates
without returning anything,


640
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,866
we'll return nil to say we
weren't able to find a result.


641
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:48,256
Let's do a similar thing
in the route map cell.


642
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:54,076
Sorry, we have this
helper here, which already,


643
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,476
which searches our
annotation views starting


644
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:59,736
from one annotation view
going forwards or backwards


645
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,736
with a given predicate
that corresponds


646
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:07,256
to whether we should return
that annotation view based


647
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:09,596
on what data model
item it represents.


648
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:14,086
So we're going to use this
to do a similar thing.


649
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,946
We're going to override
awakeFromNib.


650
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:19,326
We're going to make a
short closure that's going


651
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:21,306
to help us make multiple rotors,


652
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:24,026
because we're basically
all we're changing


653
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,106
for the various rotors
is what items we return.


654
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,956
And then we're going to use this


655
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,916
when setting our accessibility
custom rotors property.


656
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,966
We're going to have
a Route Steps rotor


657
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,286
that just returns
every waypoint.


658
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:39,106
And a Hazards rotor that
returns just the hazards.


659
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,116
Okay, so in this fact array,
what are we going to do?


660
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:45,586
Well, we need to create a
UIAccessibility custom rotor


661
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:48,006
object with the appropriate
name.


662
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:52,006
We're going to use our Search
Annotation Views helper.


663
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,306
Pass it the current element.


664
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:57,676
Whether we're going
forward or backward.


665
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,106
And what the predicate was.


666
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:04,386
And again, if we were able to
find a result, we're just going


667
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,186
to wrap it up in a customer
rotor item result and return it.


668
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,976
Otherwise we'll return
nil, saying we weren't able


669
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:12,756
to find a previous or
next match to the rotor.


670
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:14,336
All right.


671
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,556
Let's build and run this.


672
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:17,156
>> Avenue --


673
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:17,826
>> There we go.


674
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:18,496
>> Heading.


675
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:19,236
>> All right.


676
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:22,056
So let's look at
whether our changes took.


677
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:22,966
>> Avenue Loop.


678
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,566
0.8 miles.


679
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,486
Button.


680
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,236
>> Okay. So VoiceOver
spoke "Button."


681
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:27,736
That's great.


682
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,756
Someone can know that they
can activate this item now.


683
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:31,196
Let's take a look at
this Favorite button.


684
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:33,166
>> Favorite, Avenue Loop.


685
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:33,876
Button.


686
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:34,636
>> Great.


687
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:36,026
>> Selected.


688
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,926
Favorite Avenue Loop.


689
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,376
>> So the selected
trait was taken care


690
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:41,636
of for us by the frameworks.


691
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,146
So I'd like to activate
this cell.


692
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,396
>> Avenue Loop.


693
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,706
Avenue Loop.


694
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,126
Avenue Loop distractions.


695
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:50,156
Rated 3 of 5.


696
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,516
Smells. Rated 2 of 5.


697
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,996
Greenery. Rated 5 of 5.


698
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,386
Friends. Rated 4 of 5.


699
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:57,776
>> Excellent.


700
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,476
So our graph bars
are now accessible.


701
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,426
>> Avenue Loop route.


702
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:02,946
Broadway and Ridgeway.


703
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:05,316
>> Okay. Now let's try
and use our new rotors.


704
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:06,286
>> Headings.


705
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:07,476
Words. Characters.


706
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:10,146
Hazards. Route steps.


707
00:30:10,146 --> 00:30:11,796
Hazard. Hazard.


708
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:12,866
Ridgeway and Piedmont.


709
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,366
Piedmont and 41st.


710
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,886
41st and Broadway.


711
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:17,496
>> Great. So our Route
Steps rotor works.


712
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:19,126
>> Use the rotor to access --


713
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:21,026
>> Excuse me.


714
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:21,746
>> Hazards.


715
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:25,386
Hazard. Ridgeway and Piedmont.


716
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:27,566
Hazard. Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.


717
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:30,876
>> And the Hazards rotor
lets us jump right to


718
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,326
and through the list of
all the hazards there.


719
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:36,196
So, let's check out
the Steps tab again.


720
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,026
>> Steps. Selected.


721
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,826
Steps. 41st and Broadway.


722
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:41,516
Start at --


723
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,766
>> That was me.


724
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:43,526
>> Hazards.


725
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,026
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.


726
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,016
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.


727
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:53,296
Boys' Choir between Gilbert
and Montgomery on Ridgeway.


728
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:55,016
Continue along Ridgeway.


729
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,536
Hazard. Be care --


730
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:57,866
>> Oh, sorry.


731
00:30:57,966 --> 00:30:59,436
The switch was cut off there.


732
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,786
So you heard, though,
that it said "Hazards."


733
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,196
So our modification to the
accessibility label took.


734
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:07,086
It's now conveyed that these
cells do represent hazards.


735
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,276
And in addition, we were
able to jump directly


736
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,786
to them using the Hazards rotor.


737
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:12,246
All right.


738
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,216
Let's jump back to the slides.


739
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,716
So, a quick word on tvOS.


740
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:23,636
tvOS apps are built with UIKit,
so everything we've been talking


741
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,886
about earlier applies
directly to them as well.


742
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,766
But there are a few
considerations you need to keep


743
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:31,876
in mind when building your
accessible TV apps that stem


744
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:34,796
from the fact that tvOS has
a focus-driven interface.


745
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:40,096
So a common pattern on
tvOS is to use headers


746
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:43,716
to group content onscreen
and to separate it visually


747
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:44,656
from the other content.


748
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,166
You can give a similar
experience


749
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,806
to someone using your app
with VoiceOver through the use


750
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:51,676
of the Accessibility
Header Elements API.


751
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:56,126
Set this property on
your Accessible Views,


752
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,866
their super views or on
applicable view controller


753
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,876
to be the headers that are
associated with that content.


754
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,176
Then when someone
navigates to your items,


755
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,626
VoiceOver will read
the associated headers


756
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:12,446
in a distinctive pitch to give
someone using your app a sense


757
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:13,746
of place in your content.


758
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:22,906
So I recorded a short video
here of a art gallery app.


759
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:26,516
And when I play it,
I'm going to move focus


760
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:29,246
down into the collection view of
available works at the bottom.


761
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,696
You're going to hear
VoiceOver say "Available Works"


762
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:33,896
in a distinctive pitch.


763
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,626
And that's because
I set that label


764
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:40,836
to be the Accessibility Header
element of the Collection view.


765
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:42,736
Now, you'll also
hear something else.


766
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:47,766
When I pause, VoiceOver will
start reading through all


767
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,546
of the non-focusable
accessibility elements onscreen.


768
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:53,186
So let's hear that now.


769
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:54,386
>> Available works.


770
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,076
Grain. Button.


771
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,756
Title. Grain.


772
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,086
Author. Vivian Li.


773
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:01,776
Description.


774
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:03,966
Close up of a strand of grain.


775
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,216
It glistens with morning dew.


776
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:07,646
>> So, the reason I showed you


777
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:11,286
that secondary Read All behavior
is to hammer home that all


778
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:14,546
of the information your app
provides needs to be exposed


779
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:15,876
through an accessibility
element,


780
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,346
even if it's not
natively focusable


781
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:19,996
by the tvOS focus engine.


782
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:25,026
When you do that, when you
pause navigating with VoiceOver,


783
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:27,446
VoiceOver will then read all


784
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,486
of the non-focusable
content onscreen


785
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,036
so that information
will be conveyed


786
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,976
to someone using the
app with VoiceOver.


787
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:36,286
Okay. Let's wrap up.


788
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,236
So, when you're out there
implementing your apps


789
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:40,796
with an eye to accessibility,


790
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,886
keep in mind what
you've learned here.


791
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:45,136
First, accessibility
is about everyone.


792
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,466
It's about making the great
experiences your app provides


793
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,456
available to as many
people as possible.


794
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:54,236
You'll want to design
with accessibility


795
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,226
in mind from the start.


796
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:58,346
Is anything difficult to use
in your interface for someone


797
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,256
with a motor disability?


798
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:01,366
Is anything too low contrast?


799
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,186
Excuse me.


800
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:07,476
UIKit helps your apps become
accessible through your adoption


801
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:08,956
of the accessibility APIs.


802
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:13,436
And finally, accessible apps are
what make our platforms great.


803
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:14,906
So thanks so much for being here


804
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:15,906
and learning about
how to do that.


805
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:19,886
So for more information you can
check out this session online.


806
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,235
It's Session Number 202.


807
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,896
And there are some
related sessions this week


808
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,806
that you should check out.


809
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:29,005
At 10:00 a.m. in this very
room there's a session


810
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,376
on Inclusive App Design.


811
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,565
So make sure you stick around.


812
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,795
And on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m.


813
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,806
in Nob Hill there's the
session Auditing your Apps


814
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:40,166
for Accessibility, which again
is where you can learn more


815
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,396
about that new accessibility
inspector,


816
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,306
which I definitely
recommend you check out.


817
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,306
So that's all I have for today.


818
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,025
Thanks so much and have
a great conference.


819
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:59,170
[ Applause ]
