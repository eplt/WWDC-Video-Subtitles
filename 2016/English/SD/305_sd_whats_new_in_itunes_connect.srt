00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:29,606
>> Hi, good afternoon.

[ Applause ]


5
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:35,916
Good afternoon, and welcome to
What's New in iTunes Connect.


6
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:37,696
I'm Dave Van Tassell,


7
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,686
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.


8
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,606
I'm excited to spend some times
this afternoon talking to you


9
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,676
about what we've been up
to and where we're headed.


10
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:50,046
Now iTunes Connect covers the
whole lifespan of your app,


11
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,996
from uploading the metadata,
submitting to App Review,


12
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,736
releasing your app onto the
App Store, and even tracking


13
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,316
to see how well you're
doing on the App Store.


14
00:00:57,396 --> 00:00:59,546
And so, today we're
going to touch on a few


15
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:02,176
of these different
pieces of iTunes Connect.


16
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:06,896
We're going to start with
all the changes we're making


17
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:10,896
to in-app purchases and
also talk a little bit


18
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:13,236
about iTunes Connect for iOS,


19
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,486
our mobile companion
app to iTunes Connect.


20
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,596
We're also going to
talk about App Analytics


21
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,626
and what's new with
App Analytics.


22
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:29,356
And then something
completely different and new,


23
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,966
which is screenshot
simplification,


24
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,076
and this is about the
rules and requirements


25
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:37,966
about uploading images and
app previews for your app.


26
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,886
We want to talk a little
bit about iMessage apps,


27
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,736
what you have to do in iTunes
Connect in order to set up


28
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,486
and submit your iMessage apps.


29
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:50,996
And then we're going to finish
off with the updated guidelines.


30
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,706
So let's get started.


31
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:56,646
We're going to talk
about in-app purchases,


32
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,886
and the first area we're going
to talk about are subscriptions.


33
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,356
Now when we talk
about subscriptions,


34
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:04,026
what we're talking about are
autorenewable in-app purchases,


35
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:07,306
and the biggest change we made
there is we're opening them


36
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:08,846
up to all categories.


37
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,976
[ Applause ]


38
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:16,086
So no longer is it
only a few categories


39
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,006
that can use autorenewables.


40
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,716
Everybody's eligible
to use them.


41
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,156
Now we're also introducing
a new feature


42
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:25,966
so that you can price your
subscriptions differently


43
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,966
in each territory.


44
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,286
Instead of selecting one price
tier for all the territories,


45
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,856
you can select individual
price tiers for each territory.


46
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,246
And to go along with that, we're
actually increasing the number


47
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:39,766
of available price
tiers for autorenewables


48
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,636
to over 200 different
price tiers,


49
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,556
and this should really let
you pick the right price


50
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:48,716
in the right country
for your subscriptions


51
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:49,906
and your subscribers.


52
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,196
Another new feature we're adding


53
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,716
to the subscriptions is
called price preservation.


54
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,296
Now this is for your
existing subscribers.


55
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,896
When you raise the price of a
subscription, you can choose


56
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,366
if you want them to also
pay this new, higher price,


57
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:09,056
or you can let them keep
their existing price


58
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,036
so when they renew,
they will continue


59
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,656
to pay their existing price.


60
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:19,506
And the last change we're making
is for subscribers who have been


61
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:20,686
with you for over a year.


62
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:24,476
When they renew,
they'll get 85 percent


63
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:27,036
of the proceeds, and
this is live now.


64
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:31,406
So you no longer have to
wait 12 months until works.


65
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:32,956
Anyone who's already
been subscribing


66
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,736
to your in-app purchase for
more than year, when they renew


67
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,136
with their next subscription
period,


68
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,976
you will receive 85
percent of those proceeds.


69
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,171
[ Applause ]


70
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:41,836
This is a good one.


71
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:44,508
[ Applause ]


72
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,716
Now there's actually so much
to talk about with the changes


73
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,876
to subscriptions we've
created two sessions


74
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,036
that are dedicated just to this.


75
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,666
The first is a more
technical deep dive and how


76
00:03:55,666 --> 00:04:00,136
to actually program a
StoreKit, work with it in Swift,


77
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,536
check your receipt,
and validation.


78
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:03,646
It's a great session.


79
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:07,066
The second one is more about
what subscriptions actually are


80
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:10,406
and how to set up all this new
information in iTunes Connect.


81
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:15,586
To change the price in
different territories


82
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:18,995
and preserve your price, so
these are both on Tuesday.


83
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,245
If you didn't get a
chance to see them,


84
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,625
then I highly recommend
you check it out.


85
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:26,356
And those are the changes
we have for subscriptions.


86
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,456
Now this next change
is applicable


87
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,016
to all in-app purchases,


88
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,716
and this is in-app
purchase promo codes.


89
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:36,500
[ Applause ]


90
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,546
In-app purchase promo
codes are going to live


91
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,206
in iTunes Connect right next to
where you get the promo codes


92
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:43,996
for your app versions.


93
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:48,166
So you go to the features
tab for your app, and up top,


94
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,066
you have where you can
select your promo codes


95
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,046
for your app version.


96
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,106
And then down below,
we're going to let you set


97
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,886
up in-app purchase promo codes.


98
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,606
The first thing you
do is you select


99
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,686
which in-app purchase you
want to get a promo code for.


100
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,696
I'm going to do Dream
Trips to Europe.


101
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,916
I just need the one right now.


102
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,346
And so we go through
the next step.


103
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:09,506
It's how many promo
codes do you want?


104
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,636
So we can select in here.


105
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:14,226
I think right now I need 25.


106
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,546
That ought to do it.


107
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:17,856
And that's it.


108
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,536
Now I'm ready to
generate my promo codes.


109
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,666
I can download them as a text
file and distribute those,


110
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,606
and people can download my
in-app purchase via promo code.


111
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,806
Now this feature, as well
as the rest of the changes


112
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,386
to subscriptions, will be
available later this fall.


113
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:36,896
And those are our changes
to in-app purchase.


114
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:41,786
Now the next thing
I want to talk


115
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,736
about is iTunes Connect for iOS.


116
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,736
And to do that, I'm
going to introduce Mike


117
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,046
on state to tell you more.


118
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:48,726
Mike?

[ Applause ]


120
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:56,436
>> Thank you, Dave.


121
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,096
Good afternoon, everyone.


122
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:01,076
My name is Mike Amirault, and I
am very excited to be here today


123
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:04,396
to talk to you about
iTunes Connect for iOS.


124
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,586
Before I begin, how many of you


125
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:09,336
out there have downloaded
and used our app?


126
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,656
All right.


127
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,546
Quite a few.


128
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:12,646
We'll try to get the rest of you


129
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:14,236
to download it before
this session's over.


130
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:17,266
For those of you who
haven't downloaded it,


131
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:20,316
let me give you a brief
description about what it does.


132
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:24,556
iTunes Connect for iOS is
our mobile companion app


133
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,106
to the iTunes Connect website.


134
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:29,896
It allows you on-the-go access
to your sales and trends,


135
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,296
ratings and reviews
for all your apps,


136
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:37,576
the ability to reject a
binary or at least your app


137
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,566
for the store, and
push notifications,


138
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,836
so you can be immediately
notified


139
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,726
of any changes to your apps.


140
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:50,546
It is available for
free in the App Store.


141
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:51,866
Let's talk about what's new.


142
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,646
In the past year, we
released many new features


143
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:58,706
for the mobile app, but
there's three that I would


144
00:06:58,706 --> 00:06:59,936
like to highlight for you today.


145
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:07,206
First, new push notifications,
second, multiprovider support,


146
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:11,736
and third, full access
to Resolution Center


147
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,476
within the mobile app.


148
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,176
Let's look at each of these.


149
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,886
New push notifications,
we added three new types


150
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,696
of push notifications
in the past year.


151
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:28,476
First, if your app contracts
are about to expire, second,


152
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:30,436
if you get a message
from our App Review team,


153
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,956
you can now get a push
notification so you can deal


154
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,316
with the issue immediately.


155
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:39,026
And lastly, and this has been
a developer favorite so far,


156
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:41,026
you can get a push notification


157
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:44,216
when your app has finished
input processing for the store.


158
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,546
[ Applause ]


159
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:48,996
I know. It's the little things.


160
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:53,396
So let's talk about
multiprovider support.


161
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:54,916
What does that mean?


162
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:57,866
Some of you work on apps
for more than one provider.


163
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:00,406
In the past, this was
not the easiest thing


164
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:01,036
in the world to do.


165
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,356
You would have to have
a separate user account,


166
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,036
and you would have to
log out and log back in,


167
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:07,676
in order to see all your apps.


168
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:11,606
With multiprovider support,
you can one account,


169
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,126
and you can have it associated


170
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,336
with all the providers
that you work for.


171
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:19,636
I'd like to show you how
that works in the mobile app.


172
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,836
When you log in, we'll
automatically set the provider


173
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,586
to the last one that
you logged in with.


174
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,816
If you want to change it,
simply tap on the settings icon


175
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:34,556
in the bottom right, and then
tap on the providers line.


176
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:38,405
This will show you all
the providers associated


177
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,166
with your account.


178
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:45,006
Simply pick the one you want,
and now you're seeing content


179
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,186
for just that provider.


180
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,956
Now push notifications
are unique per provider.


181
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,086
So you can turn them on
for some of your providers


182
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,596
or turn them off for others.


183
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,176
It's completely up to you
how you want to set it up.


184
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:01,036
So that's multiprovider support,
and I hope that helps those


185
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,106
of you that work with
more than one provider.


186
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:08,216
Resolution Center, this was the
biggest new feature we've added


187
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:11,146
in the past year, full
access to resolution center


188
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,666
within the mobile app.


189
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,226
Let me show you what
that looks like.


190
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,316
Anywhere within the mobile
app where we display a list


191
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:23,376
of your apps, either in recents,
favorites, or search results,


192
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,306
any of your apps that have
active Resolution Center issues


193
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,886
will be displayed
with a red badge.


194
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,026
Let's tap into one of those.


195
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:34,286
So you can see at the top


196
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,586
of the view it gives you a
brief description of the number


197
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:40,576
of active issues you have and
which platform they're on.


198
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:41,956
Let's tap on that header.


199
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,856
Here you can see the
full text of the issue,


200
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,056
and you can get a
complete history


201
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,956
of all the replies
associated with it.


202
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,676
If you tap on the reply
icon in the top right,


203
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,996
you have the option here
to forward this issue


204
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:02,666
on through email to another
member of your team to look at,


205
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:08,006
or you can reply directly
within the mobile app


206
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,526
to the App Review team.


207
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:16,576
When App Review responds, you
can get a push notification


208
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,706
so you can deal with
the issue immediately.


209
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:23,426
So that's the Resolution
Center feature.


210
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:24,976
It's just one of the three --


211
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,996
So that's the Resolution
Center feature.


212
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:34,686
Now let's talk about
what's coming next.


213
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:41,176
Now there's one feature
that's been at or near the top


214
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:46,236
of this list for most
developers, sales and proceeds,


215
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:50,396
the ability to see exactly
how much money you're making


216
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:54,636
in gross sales and proceeds
directly within the mobile app.


217
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,646
I am happy to say that
this feature will be coming


218
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,976
in our next release, and I would
like to show it to you now.


219
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:06,226
So this is the Sales and
Trends module as it looks


220
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,176
when you sign in today.


221
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,616
On the left side, you'll
see the number of downloads


222
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,646
for each line item, and on
the right side in the red


223
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:16,606
and green rectangles,
you see the delta change


224
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,676
between the current
period you're looking at


225
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,836
and the previous period.


226
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,966
Much like the stocks app,
if you tap on one of the red


227
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,406
and green rectangles, you
can change the display.


228
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,116
So let's tap on it, and now
we're looking at proceeds


229
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,276
for each of these line items.


230
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:37,216
If we tap on it again, now we're
seeing the gross sales figures.


231
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,146
As we tap through
the various displays,


232
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,726
the graph at the bottom
of the page will change


233
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,606
to represent the dimension
that you're looking at.


234
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,376
Let's look at top products.


235
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:51,606
Here we're showing the
gross sales numbers


236
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,046
for your top products.


237
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:57,796
This will allow you to easily
see exactly how much money your


238
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:01,096
most popular apps are
generating for you, and again,


239
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,976
you can tap the red or
green rectangles to change


240
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,446
between sales, proceeds,
and units.


241
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:10,136
Let's look at a specific app.


242
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,166
When you're looking
at a specific app,


243
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,816
you can get the daily
sales breakdowns.


244
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,876
Here we're showing the
number of downloads.


245
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:22,476
If we tap on the view line,
we can switch between units,


246
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:24,486
proceeds, sales, and updates.


247
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:30,396
Let's look at sales.


248
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,166
Then we hit back.


249
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:33,596
So now we're displaying
the gross sales numbers


250
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,286
on a per day basis.


251
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:39,426
So that's our new sales
and proceeds feature.


252
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:41,786
It will be available
in our next release,


253
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,776
and we know you've been
waiting for it for a while,


254
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,646
so it'll be available today.


255
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:53,626
[ Applause ]


256
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:56,966
Now since we're going to be
releasing this feature today,


257
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,576
I'd like to take this
opportunity to demonstrate


258
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,336
for you my favorite
feature of our mobile app,


259
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:03,856
and that's the ability


260
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,016
to release your app
for the App Store.


261
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:11,136
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you


262
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:15,666
on the current version
of iTunes Connect for iOS


263
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,486
to release the new version
of iTunes Connect for iOS.


264
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,976
So we're going to do that now.


265
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,836
First off, you want
to find your app.


266
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,596
Mine's very easy to find because
naturally it's in my favorites.


267
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,646
And you can see we
have two versions.


268
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,056
One is currently
live on the store.


269
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,266
We don't want to be
downloading that one right now.


270
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,936
And our second one is
pending developer release.


271
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:42,626
So let's look at
our new version.


272
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:46,006
And you can see we
have two options here.


273
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:49,556
We can either release this
version, or reject the binary.


274
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,356
We don't want to reject
the binary right now.


275
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,726
So we're going to tap
on release this version,


276
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:56,886
and it will give us
a confirmation panel


277
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,336
because we don't want you
to accidentally reject


278
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,116
or release your binary.


279
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,466
And we're going to
tap on release.


280
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,706
And there it is.


281
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:05,896
The app is now ready for sale.


282
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:11,556
[ Applause ]


283
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:13,716
So the app is now
live in the App Store,


284
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,726
and it'll be available
for download shortly,


285
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:18,646
and I'm now going to hand
you back over to Dave.


286
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:19,796
>> All right.


287
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:20,286
Thanks, Mike.


288
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,736
That's what's coming up
in iTunes Connect for iOS,


289
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,796
with enhanced notification
support,


290
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,986
Resolution Center built
right into the app,


291
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:31,386
as well as the just released
sales and proceeds updates.


292
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,796
So I'm going to talk about
App Analytics, and it's hard


293
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,796
to believe that it's
been just over a year


294
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:40,756
since this has become
such a great tool


295
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,076
in iTunes Connect Toolbox.


296
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:45,786
And to talk more about what
is new with App Analytics,


297
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,176
I'm going to invite
David on stage.


298
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:48,786
David?


299
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:51,796
[ Applause ]


300
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:52,656
>> All right.


301
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,176
Thanks, Dave.


302
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:56,246
I'm David Hopkins, and I'm going
to talk to you a little bit


303
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,496
about what's new
in App Analytics.


304
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:02,506
For those of you who
haven't used App Analytics,


305
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,446
it's available as a
part of iTunes Connect.


306
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:05,776
It's free.


307
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,116
There's no integration
required, no SDK,


308
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,826
and it has customer
privacy built in.


309
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:15,246
So let's talk about
why App Analytics.


310
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,776
Why are analytics important?


311
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:20,576
First, analytics
provides answers.


312
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,386
Are customers finding my app?


313
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:24,466
Are customers downloading
my app?


314
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,646
Are they using my app?


315
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:26,656
How stable is my app?


316
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,476
These are some of the questions


317
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,996
that App Analytics
can help you answer.


318
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:34,826
Next, App Analytics reveals
missed opportunities.


319
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,666
Perhaps you have a large
customer base in Japan,


320
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,646
and you didn't realize


321
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,526
that customers were
using your app in Japan.


322
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,936
Well, that's an opportunity
for you to go


323
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,506
and localize your
app to Japanese.


324
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:49,266
And App Analytics can help you
find opportunities like this.


325
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:52,386
Next, App Analytics helps
you build a better app.


326
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,036
There's been a lot of great
sessions this week helping you


327
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,666
design and build great apps.


328
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:59,396
But we believe that building
great apps doesn't just stop


329
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:00,826
when you release
the first version.


330
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:05,056
It's important to continue
to iterate on your app,


331
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,776
and App Analytics can
provide you the information


332
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,636
to make great decisions
moving forward.


333
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:15,126
So let's talk about the types of
analytics data that we provide.


334
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,156
First, we provide
App Store data.


335
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,216
This is data about how many
times your app is being viewed


336
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,886
on the App Store, how many
customers are purchasing


337
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:24,806
your app.


338
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,436
Next, we provide sales data.


339
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,146
This is data about how much
money customers are spending


340
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:35,806
in your app, how many users
are spending money in your app,


341
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:39,256
and how much -- and how many
in-app purchases are occurring


342
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:40,966
in your app.


343
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,126
And finally, there's usage data.


344
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,206
This is data about how
frequently customers are using


345
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,476
your app, what your
customer retention is like,


346
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,396
and how stable your app is.


347
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,896
So with this data, we're able
to provide you data all the way


348
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,716
from the time that
you're acquiring customers


349
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,396
with App Store data
down to engaging


350
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,106
with customers with usage data.


351
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,946
But today, we're primarily
going to be focused


352
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,695
on updates to App Store data.


353
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:10,425
And App Store data starts
with product page views.


354
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:15,156
Every time a customer views your
App Store page on the App Store,


355
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,006
this registers a
product page view.


356
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,516
So, for example, we have
our app, Trip Guide,


357
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,935
and this is our product page.


358
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,185
Customer views this.


359
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,036
This would count as
a product page view.


360
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,916
If a customer goes on to
purchase our app, it's $3.99.


361
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,176
They purchase our app.


362
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:32,136
This would count as an app unit.


363
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,186
So app units help you track
the number of new users


364
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,226
that you have in any
given time period.


365
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,146
So this helps you understand
your App Store presence.


366
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,356
You're able to see
the number of times


367
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:43,626
that your product
page was viewed.


368
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,866
You're able to see the
number of new users you have.


369
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:49,846
But it doesn't tell the whole
story of your App Store presence


370
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,696
because it doesn't tell
you all the other places


371
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,006
in the App Store that
customers can view your app.


372
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,486
And so, to help you
understand that,


373
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,976
we're introducing a new
measure called impressions.


374
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:07,076
[ Applause ]


375
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,606
So impressions are going to
show you the number of times


376
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,926
that customers have viewed
your app on the App Store.


377
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,716
So we talked about one way
that customers view your apps.


378
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:17,476
That's your product page.


379
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,186
But let's talk about other ways


380
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,846
that customers view your
app on the App Store.


381
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,506
First, there's search.


382
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,426
A customer searches for
guides, for example,


383
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:28,876
and our app Trip Guide shows
up in the search results.


384
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,796
This will count as an
impression as well.


385
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,526
If you're taking advantage
of the new search ads


386
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,326
and your app shows up in
search results this way,


387
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,986
this will also count
as an impression.


388
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:44,706
If your app shows up
in the category section


389
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,726
or in our top charts or
featured, these are all ways


390
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,866
that will register
impressions in App Analytics.


391
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,176
So this is the new
feature impressions.


392
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,266
Let's take a look at what this
looks like in the product.


393
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,096
This is the App List.


394
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:03,626
This the entry point to
the App Analytics product.


395
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,506
From here, you can see a
snapshot across all of your iOS


396
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,256
and Apple TV apps
across five key measures,


397
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:11,926
starting with your impressions


398
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,596
to see how many customers
are viewing your app


399
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,516
on the App Store, app units


400
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,256
to tell you how many
new users you have,


401
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,056
sales to tell you how much
money customers are spending in


402
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:24,716
or on your app, sessions to tell
you how many times customers


403
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:27,916
have opened your app, and
crashes to give you an idea


404
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,706
of how stable your app is.


405
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:33,416
We show you the value for
the current period as well


406
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,486
as the percentage change
from the previous period


407
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,876
to help you understand whether
this number is good or bad.


408
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,536
So we can see our
app, Trip Guide.


409
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:42,896
It's in the first row here.


410
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:46,056
And we can see that
in the last 30 days,


411
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,456
we had around 300,000
impressions.


412
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,716
This is a 17 percent increase
from the previous period.


413
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:55,186
If we want to find out more
information about this number,


414
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:56,796
you can click into that number,


415
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,546
and it'll take you
to the metrics view.


416
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,406
So the metrics view allows
you to see a little bit


417
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:04,486
of more information about
any of these numbers.


418
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,986
You can see this data
charted over time,


419
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:10,526
and you can also slice this
by various dimensions to see


420
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:11,706
if you want to see something --


421
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,206
drill down to something
more specific,


422
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:17,016
perhaps how many impression you
have just in the United States.


423
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,736
In addition to providing
a count of impressions,


424
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:25,346
we're also providing unique
devices on impressions.


425
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:27,876
So if you select
that, you'll filter


426
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,456
down to just the unique
devices for impressions.


427
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:33,086
So if I were to view
my app Trip Guide


428
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,976
on the App Store three times
in one day on the same device,


429
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,056
that would count as
three impressions,


430
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,316
but one unique impression.


431
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:45,196
So if I select that, now I'm
viewing just the unique devices


432
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:45,976
for impressions.


433
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,986
This helps us better understand
the total number of customers


434
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,206
who are viewing our
app on the App Store


435
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,396
at any given time period.


436
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:57,186
With this, we can start
to compare that number


437
00:20:57,696 --> 00:21:00,556
to the number of new users we
have, and then we can start


438
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,006
to understand our App
Store conversion rate,


439
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:06,996
how well our App Store presence
is converting to new users.


440
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,386
So I'll walk you through that.


441
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:13,086
You can select compare to
and compare to app units.


442
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:17,066
Now you're viewing app units
compared to impressions


443
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,226
on the same graph, but
it'd be a little easier


444
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,726
to view this data as a ratio.


445
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:25,276
So if you change from single
access and select ratio,


446
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:29,446
now you can view this as
a ratio trended over time,


447
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,696
and we can see that
our app has about --


448
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:35,746
it takes about ten
impressions for one app unit.


449
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:39,226
And so, we can start to --
as we update our screenshots


450
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,726
and our description to our
App Store page, we can start


451
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:45,366
to see what effect that has on
our App Store conversion rate.


452
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:50,066
So that's the impression feature
and how you can start to use it


453
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,786
to look at your App
Store conversion rate.


454
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,336
And we're excited to announce


455
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,796
that all this is available
now in App Analytics.


456
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,786e
[ Applause ]


457
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,786
[ Applause ]


458
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,756
So let's talk about what's
next in App Analytics.


459
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:07,196
We've given you impressions to
help you understand the number


460
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,386
of customers that are viewing
your app on the App Store,


461
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,296
but the next question we want


462
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,916
to help you answer is how
are customers finding my app?


463
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:18,636
And we do this today
with sources.


464
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,136
And so, let's talk about what
types of sources there are


465
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,906
for customers to find
your app on the App Store.


466
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,586
The first source is
browsing the App Store.


467
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,426
So we talked about
one example earlier


468
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:34,896
with searching on the App Store.


469
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:35,986
We've searched for guides.


470
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:40,646
That's one way that
customers discover your app.


471
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,056
Similarly, if we were to find
our app browsing the App Store


472
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,676
in the top charts, in featured,
in the categories section,


473
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,486
these are all ways that
customers are finding your app


474
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:52,106
by browsing the App Store.


475
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:56,256
So that's one source for
customers to find your app.


476
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,416
But we recognize that
there are other ways


477
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:02,556
that customers are finding your
apps outside of the App Store.


478
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,696
And so, the first source
that we're going to talk


479
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,426
about outside of the
App Store are websites.


480
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:12,556
So websites are tracked any
time a customer taps on a link


481
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:15,336
from a website in Mobile
Safari, and that takes you


482
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,286
to the App Store page.


483
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:19,526
This counts as a
source type of websites.


484
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:23,836
So we have our app Trip Guide
here, and we've included a link


485
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,996
on our website,
TripGuide.Apple.com.


486
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:29,576
This would be a situation
where the source is website,


487
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,676
and the website is
TripGuide.Apple.com.


488
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:36,096
So that's one source


489
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:40,426
where customers can find your
app outside of the App Store.


490
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,876
The other source that
we're going to talk


491
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:44,046
about for customers to
find your app outside


492
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:46,976
of the App Store are other apps.


493
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:52,606
So for example, we tweeted
about our app Trip Guide here,


494
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,706
and we included a link
to our App Store page.


495
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:57,036
We're trying to promote our
app socially on Twitter.


496
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,486
Someone follows that link.


497
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:02,036
That would be an
example of a case


498
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:05,396
where the source was another
app, and the app was Twitter.


499
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:10,456
Similarly, if customers are
sharing your app using mail,


500
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:13,856
if you're taking advantage
of the new messages features


501
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:16,946
in iOS 10 and customers are
sharing your app on messages,


502
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,786
these are other examples


503
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:21,086
of where the source
would be another app


504
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,646
for customers to find your app.


505
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,726
And the apps here would
be mail and messages.


506
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,866
Okay. So those are the
three sources types


507
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,306
for how customers
are find your apps.


508
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,586
Let's take a look at how we plan


509
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:37,326
to visualize this
in the product.


510
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:39,616
First, if you've been
using the product today,


511
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,516
you're probably familiar
with this view.


512
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,816
This is the list of
your top websites.


513
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:46,126
From here, you're able to see


514
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:49,006
which websites are driving
the most traffic to your app,


515
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:51,556
and not only are you able to
see the number of impressions


516
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:54,326
that came from these websites,
but you're also able to see


517
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,536
that across your app units


518
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,586
to understand how many new
users came from each website.


519
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,616
You're able to see the sales


520
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:03,056
to understand how much money
these customers are spending


521
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,266
who came from each website.


522
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,176
And you're able to see sessions
so you can understand the usage


523
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,226
from customers who
came from each website.


524
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,616
So we talked about the Twitter
mobile app as an example.


525
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,516
Well, if a customer also is
viewing your app and came


526
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,196
from Twitter.com in
Safari, this would show


527
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:20,856
up under your top websites.


528
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:21,546
All right.


529
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:25,106
So that's the list
of your top websites.


530
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:26,416
Let's talk about how we plan


531
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:29,446
to visualize the list
of your top apps.


532
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,656
This is the App List.


533
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:37,606
From here, you're able to view
the top apps that contributed


534
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:40,086
to traffic for customers
finding your app.


535
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:43,206
So we talked -- again,
we talked about Twitter,


536
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:44,746
the Twitter mobile app.


537
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:45,536
It'll show up here.


538
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,916
Messages, if that's a source
for customers finding your app,


539
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,436
this will show up here as well.


540
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,316
So as you start to
promote your app


541
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,716
across many different
channels, you'll be able to view


542
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,926
which channels are the
most effective and be able


543
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:02,016
to compare them not just across
impressions, but across all


544
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,956
of the measures that
you have available


545
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:04,936
on App Analytics today.


546
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:10,500
[ Applause ]


547
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:17,386
So that's the new app sources
feature with the new top apps.


548
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,786
Next we're going to
talk about how we plan


549
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,996
to visualize the three sources


550
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,186
that I talked to
you about before.


551
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:25,616
And the first way is
with the Source Overview.


552
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:29,716
With the Source Overview, we're
planning to give you visibility


553
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,406
into each of these three sources
so that you can understand


554
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,046
which of these three
sources is contributing


555
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:38,206
to the most customers
discovering your app.


556
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:41,626
So you can see customers
who found your app


557
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:44,386
from browsing the App
Store, customers who came


558
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,526
from an app refer,
and customers who came


559
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,576
from a web refer,
all in one place.


560
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:50,816
And you can see a percentage
from each of those sources.


561
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:52,936
Right now, we're
looking at impressions,


562
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,136
but you can also look at
any of the other measures.


563
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,856
So again, you can
look at your sales.


564
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,976
You can look at your sessions


565
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,306
and understand how
customers are using your app


566
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:03,506
that came from each source.


567
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,286
And so, we talked before about
the App Store conversion rate


568
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:09,826
and how you're able to look at
your App Store conversion rate.


569
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,516
Well, you could also look at
your App Store conversion rate


570
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:14,286
across each of these sources.


571
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,886
So let's do that.


572
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,666
When we left off in the
metrics view, we were here


573
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,866
in the App Store
conversion rate.


574
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:24,796
If we want to view this rate
across each of our sources,


575
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,086
we can select view by.


576
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:29,856
And you can see in there we have
all of our sources available.


577
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,966
We could look at territory


578
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,546
to understand how our App
Store conversion rate is


579
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,576
on each territory.


580
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,736
But for right now, we're
going to select source type.


581
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:40,356
And so, if we select
source type, now we're able


582
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,936
to see our App Store
conversion rate for each


583
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,696
of the three sources
that we talked about


584
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,196
and better understand


585
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:51,036
which source is converting
the best on the App Store.


586
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:53,196
So that's the new sources
feature and how we plan


587
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:54,456
to visualize it in the product.


588
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:56,976
We're excited to say that this
will be coming later this year.

That's what's new
in App Analytics


592
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,016
and a little bit
of what's coming.


593
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,256
I'm going to hand it
back over to Dave.


594
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:07,956
Thank you.

00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:12,500
[ Applause ]


596
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:17,266
>> All right.


597
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:17,776
Thanks, David.


598
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,066
That's what's new
in App Analytics.


599
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:25,016
So let's talk about
screenshot simplification.


600
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:30,016
And to talk about this,
the best way to do it is


601
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:33,776
to take a step back and think
about what are our screenshots?


602
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:37,056
So you can have up to
five screenshots for each


603
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:40,626
of your devices that give
customers a real quick snapshot


604
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:42,226
into what's going on in your app


605
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,436
when they're browsing
the App Store.


606
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:48,496
And since we give
you five screenshots


607
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:52,016
for each device size, when
you're developing for iPhone,


608
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,296
that's going to give
you 20 screenshots.


609
00:28:56,256 --> 00:29:01,266
As you start to include
iPad into your app,


610
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,326
that number increases to 30,


611
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,206
and this is before you've even
done any kind of localization.


612
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,906
And we support up to
28 different languages


613
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:14,556
on iTunes Connect and the
App Store, bringing you


614
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:17,136
up to 840 different
screenshots that you can upload.


615
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,226
And we haven't even
included the Apple Watch.


616
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:24,006
With Apple Watch, that
number increases to up


617
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,156
to 980 screenshots,
and this is great.


618
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:27,716
There's a lot of power in this


619
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:31,526
because you can actually
get the right screenshot


620
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,626
for the right device and
the correct localization.


621
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,576
But you don't always
need this much power,


622
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:42,646
and that's what screenshot
simplification is about


623
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:46,556
and how we can simplify
this into just one set


624
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:48,686
of screenshots per
device family.


625

626
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:50,976
Yeah, we can clap for this one.

[ Applause ]


628
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:57,806
So let's see what this is going
to look like in iTunes Connect.


629
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,926
So we're going to start
on the version page,


630
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,226
and the first thing
you'll notice is that there


631
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:05,906
at the top we just have the
two sections, iPhone, iPad.


632
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:10,986
And now the [inaudible] will
support our larger sized iPhone


633
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,206
screenshots, the 5-1/2 inch.


634
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:17,026
So we drag those on in.


635
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:18,466
They fill in.


636
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,246
We have our app preview first,


637
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,486
followed by our five
screenshots.


638
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,616
And if we want to see our other
sizes, that's just down below.


639
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:29,156
We can open it up,
and we can see


640
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:30,916
that automatically we've begun


641
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,806
to share those screenshots I
uploaded from my 5-1/2 inch


642
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,466
down to these smaller sizes.


643
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,686
In fact, if we zoom in,
we can tell we've written


644
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,976
on the screenshot where
these images came from.


645
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,886
And if we want to change
this, what screenshots we have


646
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:50,526
for these other sizes,
then we have a new area


647
00:30:50,526 --> 00:30:52,276
of iTunes Connect
called the Media Manager.


648
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,396
Now let's look into this.


649
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,276
This Media Manager is going
to hold all of our information


650
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,756
about all those screenshots
and app previews that we upload


651
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,326
across different languages
on all of our devices.


652
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:06,546
So you can see at the top we
have our 5-1/2 inch screenshots,


653
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:09,426
and they've been shared down
below with the smaller sizes.


654
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:13,056
In fact, if we change
our screenshot order


655
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:16,136
for the 5-1/2 inch, it's
also going to change those


656
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:16,756
that have been shared.


657
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:21,226
But not every app looks
and behaves the same


658
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:25,526
on the 5-1/2 inch iPhone as
it does on the smaller sizes.


659
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,856
So you may want to
upload screenshots


660
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:29,756
that are more specific
for your device size.


661
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:35,376
In order to do that,
there's a checkbox right here


662
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,576
for our 4.7 inch.


663
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:40,286
We're going to stop sharing
by unchecking that box,


664
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,686
and that's going to clear
out these shared screenshots.


665
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:47,086
We simply drag in the
new 4.7 inch screenshots,


666
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:53,136
and now these screenshots
are actually sharing


667
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:54,446
with those that are smaller.


668
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,376
We're going to find the
next closest larger size


669
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,096
from which we can
share screenshots.


670
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:05,436
Now if we want to localize our
app on our app screenshots,


671
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,576
we can do the same thing
in other languages.


672
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:10,916
So let's pick German.


673
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,036
When we look at our German
images inside of Media Manager,


674
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,906
we're going to see that the
5-1/2 inch German screenshots


675
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,446
came from my default
localization,


676
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:23,176
in this case my US English.


677
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:28,516
And the 4.7 are copied from
the 4.7 default localization.


678
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:32,106
If I want to upload
German-specific screenshots,


679
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:36,146
I can come here to my
checkbox, uncheck this sharing,


680
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:38,136
and this is actually
going to clear out all


681
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,206
of my screenshots for German.


682
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,626
We're going to favor your
localized screenshots


683
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,906
over all else.


684
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:47,886
So now we can drag in my
5-1/2 inch German screenshots,


685
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,446
and they're going to fill in
not only this larger size,


686
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,156
but everything down below.


687
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:57,466
And since my German app
also behaves differently


688
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:00,756
on these different
sizes, I can come in here,


689
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:03,676
uncheck the sharing
for this 4.7 inch.


690
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:08,136
They get cleared out, and I
drag in my new screenshots.


691
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,766
And that's it.


692
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,676
And that's how we use
screenshot simplification.


693
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:17,836
There's two different
kinds of media management.


694
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:20,306
We start with iPhone and iPad
where they're going to share


695
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,776
across all the different
localizations as well


696
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,006
as the different
size that you have.


697
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,996
But there are some device types
that don't have multiple sizes,


698
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:30,236
Apple Watch, Apple
TV, and the Mac.


699
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,956
You can still use
screenshot simplification,


700
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,756
but in this case, all
you're going to share


701
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:36,286
across are the localizations.


702
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:42,536
What if you do want to still
upload all 980 screenshots?


703
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:46,646
Well, the best way to do that
is for the Transporter XML Feed.


704
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,966
This is a command line
automation tool that we provide


705
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,366
that lets you upload
all screenshot sizes,


706
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:56,286
all your app previews, as well
as any other localized metadata.


707
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,716
You can set your
pricing for your app.


708
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,486
You can include metadata
for your in-app purchases,


709
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,636
your leaderboards, and
achievements in Game Center.


710
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:05,156
And if you want more
information about this,


711
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:08,426
you can go to the Resources and
Help section of iTunes Connect,


712
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,786
or last year we had a great
session on getting the most


713
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:14,396
out of iTunes Connect, where
we went over a little bit more


714
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:17,406
to Transporter XML Feed.


715
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:20,735
So what is screenshot
simplification?


716
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:23,525
Quite simply, create only
the required screenshots


717
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:27,076
that you need and share those
across localizations and sizes.


718
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:30,085
And this will be
available later this summer.


719
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:33,456
Now I want to talk
about iMessage apps.


720
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:36,186
This is a great new
feature that we're providing


721
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:37,386
so you can really interact


722
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:39,576
with the people using
your app in new ways.


723
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,846
And we wanted to touch
on what do you have to do


724
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,596
on iTunes Connect to get these
apps ready for the App Store?


725
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:49,746
We tried to make it as simple
as possible and as relatable


726
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:50,936
to what you're already doing.


727
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:52,786
So the first thing is,


728
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,126
is if you're creating a
Stickers iMessage app,


729
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,616
then we have a new category
for you, a Stickers category,


730
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,686
with some more subcategories,
all about Stickers.


731
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:07,586
And the second thing is we
have device screenshots just


732
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:08,366
for your iMessage apps.


733
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:11,856
So you can show what it'll be
like to use your app inside


734
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:13,866
of messages, and
we can show those


735
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,626
on the App Store
for iMessage apps.


736
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,526
Now how does this work
with the Media Management?


737
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,046
iMessage apps behave
just like iPhone and iPad


738
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,296
in that we have different
sizes we take


739
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:29,066
so you can show how it works
on all of your devices as well


740
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:30,436
as across localizations.


741
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:34,136
And this works the same way
with screenshot simplification.


742
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:38,686
Now if you want to know more
information about iMessage apps,


743
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,926
we have two great
sessions on that.


744
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,676
If you didn't get a
chance to see those, again,


745
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:44,186
I encourage you to
check those out.


746
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:48,496
And that's what it
takes in order


747
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,716
to use your iMessage
apps on iTunes Connect.


748
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:54,406
Now the last thing
we want to talk


749
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,836
about today are the
guideline changes.


750
00:35:56,376 --> 00:36:01,016
And those of you who
are frequent viewers


751
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:02,146
of "What's New on
iTunes Connect?"


752
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:05,416
know that often we take this
time to talk with App Review


753
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,136
about do they have any
suggestions for you on ways


754
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:11,636
to maybe get your app through
App Review more efficiently


755
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:15,416
or perhaps some common stumbling
blocks that developers run into.


756
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:17,786
And this year, we're going to
do it a little bit differently


757
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:18,566
for a couple of reasons.


758
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,186
The first is that App Review
times have gone way down,


759
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:24,826
and we've worked really
hard to make that faster.


760
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:31,136
[ Applause ]


761
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,016
And the second is that
we've updated our guidelines


762
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:37,006
to hopefully make it easier
for you to get these answers


763
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:39,236
to the questions, and you
can get this information


764
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:39,836
much faster.


765
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:44,696
So the biggest change in
our guidelines is the way


766
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:45,396
in which they're worded.


767
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:46,856
You could call it
more human readable.


768
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:50,806
Instead of a list of things,
don't do this, or don't do that,


769
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:54,096
we've really tried to give you
advice on what makes a good app


770
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,826
and what are the best ways


771
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:56,966
to get your app ready
for the App Store.


772
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:05,126
In fact, we've also
included information in here


773
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:09,106
for when you're ready to submit
your app, sort of a checklist


774
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:14,146
on things you can be thinking
of, such as is my server ready


775
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:17,336
to go when I submit to App
Review, not just when it's ready


776
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,056
to go on the App Store?


777
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:21,396
Does your app require a
login in order to work?


778
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,736
If that's the case,
go ahead and put


779
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:25,896
that on iTunes Connect before
you submit to App Review.


780
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:30,376
These guidelines are
really meant to be read


781
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:33,216
so you can understand them,
just sort of sit down.


782
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:34,896
In fact, how many people
have already read the new


783
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:35,686
App Guidelines?


784
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:38,206
So that's not enough.


785
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,546
Those at home can't see this.


786
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,716
It takes about 20 to
30 minutes to sit down


787
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:45,096
and read the guidelines and
get a feel for what they are.


788
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:50,106
The great thing about
them being human readable


789
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:52,596
in English is it's much
easier to translate them


790
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:54,916
to be human readable in Spanish
or human readable in Chinese.


791
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:58,066
And so, we've localized in
these App Guidelines in up


792
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,136
to ten different languages.


793
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:07,256
We've also combined our macOS
guidelines with iOS guidelines.


794
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,606
You only have one place
to go to get an answer


795
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:12,426
to what is appropriate
for my app.


796
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,186
And lastly, I want to talk


797
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,926
about the organization
of these guidelines.


798
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,116
We want to try to make
it easier, like I said,


799
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:26,306
to find answers to questions
that you have about your app


800
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:29,456
and getting it through App
Review, sort of changing it


801
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:32,576
from more of a feature-based
system to more contextual.


802
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,696
And so, we broke this
into five different areas.


803
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:39,316
And in fact, it kind
of shows some


804
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:40,656
of the changes with
the guidelines.


805
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:43,536
We've created a comic book and
broke these five different areas


806
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:45,296
into five different
parts of that book.


807
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:47,476
So let's talk about
this different areas.


808
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:51,796
The first is safety, and
this is really the safety


809
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:56,006
of the people using your app,
the content, if it's appropriate


810
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:57,926
for kids, if it's safe for kids.


811
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,026
And also, are the
people that are going


812
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,496
to be using your
app doing some harm


813
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:02,696
to themselves or to the device?


814
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:05,916
It's that kind of safety.


815
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:08,886
The next area is performance.


816
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:11,996
What kind of hardware
does your app need?


817
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:12,786
How is it running?


818
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:17,256
Then we can talk about business.


819
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,416
Is your app appropriate
for these in-app purchases?


820
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,216
How does it work
well with Apple Pay?


821
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,676
Do you have a alternate
business model?


822
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,626
You want to understand what kind


823
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,646
of business models are
appropriate for the App Store.


824
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:32,946
You can check with the
business area of the guidelines.


825
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:39,166
Let me talk with design
and what makes a great app


826
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:40,036
for the App Store?


827
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:47,976
Simple, refined,
innovative, and easy to use.


828
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,226
And last, everybody's
favorite, legal.


829
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:53,926
A couple of people
thought that was funny.


830
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:58,656
This is where we can talk
about the rules around privacy,


831
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,096
intellectual property,
and gambling apps.


832
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:04,096
If you want to know when do I
need to have a privacy policy


833
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,066
and more information about
that, you can check these out.


834
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:10,336
And these are our different
areas for the guideline changes.


835
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:14,216
Again, instead of reading
the guidelines and finding


836
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:17,136
out that you need a privacy
policy for a kid's category


837
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,556
or you need a privacy
policy for an autorenewable,


838
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,546
why don't you instead
go to one place to find


839
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,316
out what are the rules
around privacy policies?


840
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,426
In order to help
you find the answers


841
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,056
to the questions
you have better.


842
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:32,866
And those are our
changes to the guidelines.


843
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,246
So what's new in iTunes Connect?


844
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:38,776
Well, we've got the
changes to in-app purchases


845
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:40,656
with subscriptions
and promo codes.


846
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:44,356
We have updates to
iTunes Connect for iOS


847
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,126
with a Resolution
Center built into the app


848
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,306
and just released changes
to sales and proceeds.


849
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:54,046
We also talked about the
new impressions coming


850
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:57,866
to App Analytics
and other sources.


851
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,106
Screenshot simplification
allows you


852
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:04,516
to create just the screenshots
that you need and the languages


853
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:05,596
and sizes that work for you.


854
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,296
We talked about what
do you need to do


855
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,286
to get your iMessage apps
ready for the App Store


856
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:14,556
through iTunes Connects and the
changes to the App Guidelines.


857
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:19,146
If you have any more questions,
you can get more information


858
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,716
from our sessions URL here
at the Developers Conference.


859
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:24,526
We talked about these
other related sessions.


860
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,216
I'm putting them here so
you can take a look at them.


861
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:28,436
And with that, I hope you've
had a great conference


862
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,046
and a great week, and
we'll see you next year.


863
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:30,976
Thanks a lot.


864
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:33,508
