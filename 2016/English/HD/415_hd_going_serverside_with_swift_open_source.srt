00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:29,206
>> Welcome.


4
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:32,436
My name's Philippe Hausler, and
I work at Apple on Foundation,


5
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,656
and today we're going to
talk about Swift On Servers.


6
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,406
We'll go over why Server-Side
Swift is compelling,


7
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:42,526
how all the pieces fit together,
what you get out of box,


8
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:46,086
what you don't, some real-world
examples of Swift running


9
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:49,546
on the server, and, most
importantly, what you can do


10
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,896
to contribute to making
Swift On Servers awesome.


11
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,066
Modern application
development isn't just building


12
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,176
for one platform.


13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,906
It's an ecosystem.


14
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,146
You'd be hard pressed
to find an application


15
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,886
that doesn't have some sort
of server-side component,


16
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,836
be it from analytics,
real-time communications,


17
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,916
or shared state being
stored in the Cloud,


18
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:10,966
servers are an integral
component


19
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,986
in making rich and
compelling apps.


20
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,206
Now building the
next great thing,


21
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,386
often there are contact
switches that have to be made.


22
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,966
You end up humming along,
writing your application,


23
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,166
and the next thing you
know you're writing


24
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,296
in a different language.


25
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:30,576
This can cause downtime and
repeated implementations,


26
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,586
and we all know how much we
dislike repeating ourselves


27
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:34,066
in code.


28
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:37,916
But Swift running on the
server has the potential not


29
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,646
to just provide a seamless
development experience


30
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,866
but also a richer and more
compelling user experience, too.


31
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,476
By sharing the right
parts of your code base,


32
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,716
time can be saved not
just for writing it


33
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,216
but also testing and QA.


34
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,216
But it's not just the language.


35
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,166
It's the API's.


36
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:57,996
It's often hard to disambiguate
the architecture of the API's


37
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:01,246
from the construction of
the language with constructs


38
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,476
like strings, arrays,
dictionaries, concurrency.


39
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,626
They often become a core set


40
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,866
of libraries expressing
that language.


41
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,086
And with that, it brings us
to the architecture of Swift,


42
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:15,186
not just on the server,
but how Swift fits together


43
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,486
on all platforms.


44
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:19,836
As in early design
consideration,


45
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:23,596
Swift wouldn't just be
a Darwin-only language.


46
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:27,516
It can by its very nature
run on many platforms,


47
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:30,756
and with the community's help,
that goal has just been started


48
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:33,326
to be realized with
platforms, support to platforms


49
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:36,146
like [inaudible] SD,
targets like Raspberry Pi,


50
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,706
and even things like
Windows and Android.


51
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,206
Some pretty exciting stuff.


52
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:45,346
On all of these, Swift relies
on the system libraries.


53
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:48,166
Building on top of that, you
have the standard library.


54
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:51,366
It provides some of those
fundamental basic building


55
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,566
blocks and data structures.


56
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:58,266
On Darwin, we have an
addendum called the overlay


57
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,526
that aids system frameworks
to interface better in Swift,


58
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:06,096
but since there is no foundation
or dispatch shipped with Linux,


59
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,886
a portable interface
was established to fill


60
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,406
in those fundamental pieces.


61
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:13,926
We started off with an outline
of what needed to be there


62
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,216
and a few initial
implementations,


63
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:19,936
and with the community, we have
added many of those basic items


64
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,826
that are needed for
any modern development.


65
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,126
So when you application
comes into the mix,


66
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,786
you can see that all


67
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:30,356
of the pieces just fit together
the same way on both platforms.


68
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,666
With Swift built in this
manner, as a developer,


69
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,466
you can pick the right pieces
out of your application to build


70
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,816
for the server and use
familiar constructs


71
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,666
that you're used to using.


72
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,446
Swift.org is the central place


73
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,806
for getting the most
recent version of Swift.


74
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,026
Signing up for the
mailing list, getting links


75
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:53,306
for the GitHub repositories or
continuous integration builds,


76
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,116
or a great place to
read the documentation


77
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,116
on the most recent
developments in Swift.


78
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,726
It is the place for
the Swift tool chain.


79
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:04,336
So what comes in this toolbox?


80
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,466
Out of the box, you get
support for building


81
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,176
on both Linux and Mac.


82
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:13,426
So you can develop on your Mac
and deploy to the Linux servers.


83
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,456
There are continuous
integration servers to ensure


84
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:21,656
that the changes that are made
to the language and API's happen


85
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,706
and continuously integrate


86
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,856
so that everything
works as expected.


87
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,316
You have the standard library.


88
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:32,106
That gives you those basic
building blocks, protocols,


89
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,176
structures, and types
that you would use


90
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,096
in building any Swift
application,


91
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,966
but you also get Foundation,
Dispatch, and XCTest as projects


92
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,086
within the, the Swift
tool chain.


93
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,326
These give you a cross
section of portable API's


94
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,476
that can keep your code
nearly the same as you build


95
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,116
across multiple platforms.


96
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,986
But you also get a suite of
tools for compiling, packaging,


97
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:59,136
and debugging Swift apps as well
as the Swift Rebel to complete,


98
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:02,346
try out some of those new
features, and you get all


99
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:05,126
of these things on
both platforms.


100
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:09,806
Now there are a few things
that are not included.


101
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,836
There was a design, a design
decision that was made


102
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,696
that some things just
didn't make sense


103
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,676
in a cross platform nature,
or that they were better,


104
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:21,886
better served to let developers
build their own solutions


105
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,466
since they're highly
specialized.


106
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:27,036
New platforms are not just code.


107
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,476
They are continuous
integration and verification,


108
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,036
and the champions reporting


109
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:36,436
to new platforms usually know
the best to implement those.


110
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,116
User interface is a very
platform-specific thing.


111
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,446
On iOS, you have UIKit.


112
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:48,866
On Mac, you have
AppKit, and even though


113
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,076
that they share a
lot of similarities,


114
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,636
there have to be
two different things


115
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,556
because they're solving
different problems.


116
00:05:56,426 --> 00:06:00,016
For that matter, UI
can be web templates,


117
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:04,746
and sometimes the user in user
interface isn't a person, and,


118
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,696
instead, it's another
service connection


119
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,776
that is routing a
service protocol.


120
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,996
These are all clearly something
that are very, very specialized.


121
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,326
Now deploying your
applications to the server in


122
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,166
and of itself is a
specialized task.


123
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,236
This way you can pick
the right service


124
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:26,086
that fits your requirements,
your budget, your scale, and,


125
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,676
of course, your application.


126
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:31,806
This shouldn't have to be tied
to a specific track in Swift.


127
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,506
Running on the server, you
can have multiple applications


128
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:36,406
running with multiple
versions of Swift.


129
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:41,126
It's amazing to see the
enthusiasm to create an open


130
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:44,266
and sharing community,
and these are just a few


131
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,296
of the great things,
great opportunities


132
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:47,926
to enrich the Swift ecosystem.


133
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:52,926
There have already been some
great efforts put forth in all


134
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,286
of these areas and more,
and our fellow contributors


135
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,856
over at IBM have been making
some really pretty neat things.


136
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,856
We've gone over some
abstract overviews.


137
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,586
So let's dive a little
bit deeper.


138
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:07,246
So here to present some
real-world examples


139
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,086
of how they're, they are
getting involved in Swift

142
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:21,476
>> Thank you, Philippe.


143
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,626
Hi. My name is John Ponzo.


144
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:26,226
I'm the Technical Leader for
Mobile Cloud Development at IBM,


145
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,726
and I'm thrilled to
be part of WWDC today.


146
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:34,936
We at IBM are very excited about
Swift community and being part


147
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,896
of the open source, and
we see great potential


148
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:37,646
for the language.


149
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:41,956
For those unfamiliar, let me
tell you a little bit about IBM


150
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:43,656
and our involvement with Swift.


151
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:47,046
Apple and IBM announced
our partnership focusing


152
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,436
on enterprise apps
and solutions in 2014.


153
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,486
And, subsequently, IBM became
one of the first, early adopters


154
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:58,676
of Swift when it was announced
here at WWDC just two years ago.


155
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,346
Since that time, we've created


156
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,906
over 100 enterprise
applications,


157
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:08,076
building those apps and
solutions entirely in Swift,


158
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:12,026
and we also have one of
the highest concentrations


159
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,126
of Swift developers at IBM
building these apps today.


160
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,636
Our experience building
these enterprise apps


161
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:22,216
and solutions consistently
points to the importance


162
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:25,066
of the backend, enabling
a great experience.


163
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,036
As developers, we know
how important it is


164
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:33,556
to have a backend, to enable
a great mobile experience.


165
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:37,446
We also know it's
important for us to quickly


166
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:40,666
and safely deploy the right
code to the right place,


167
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,596
and that's why we're so excited


168
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:46,546
to help bring Swift
to the server.


169
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,696
We appreciate the
wealth of activity


170
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:52,586
around Swift.org community,
ranging from the mailing list


171
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,596
to code contributions and
new open source projects


172
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:56,246
that are forming.


173
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:59,756
I'd like to highlight some of
the things that we're doing


174
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,726
at IBM to help the open
source community bring Swift


175
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,326
to the server.


176
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,156
First, I'll tell you about
community enablements


177
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,466
and tell you about
our Swift Sandbox


178
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,666
and Swift package catalog
services that we created


179
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,316
to help developers to
easily learn, discover,


180
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,266
and share Swift assets.


181
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:23,716
Next, we are motivated by
consistent developer experience


182
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,896
that links the client and
server, and towards that end,


183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,046
we created the Kitura web
framework that's helping


184
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,776
to motivate and prioritize
our contributions


185
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:36,556
into the core libraries of
libdispatch and foundation.


186
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:41,296
And next, Cloud enablement
is an important part


187
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:44,446
of the development
process, and we are driven


188
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:48,316
to make it even easier and fun
to deploy Swift to the Cloud.


189
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,836
Through early support in the
IBM Cloud for Swift runtime


190
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:56,736
and the introduction of
Xcode companion applications


191
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:00,566
to help deploy that
code to the Cloud.


192
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,896
When Swift.org was
released in December,


193
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,716
one of the first things
that we wanted to do was


194
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,636
to help grow the
developer ecosystem.


195
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,566
We saw the value of the
language, and we wanted


196
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:14,046
to quickly introduce
it to other developers.


197
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:18,296
We created the Sandbox that
allowed, it allows developers


198
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,646
to easily run and
test code on Linux.


199
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:25,346
The Sandbox runs in a
browser, and with it,


200
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:28,816
you can easily start writing
your Swift code, save that code,


201
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,596
and see the execution
on the server.


202
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,636
Since we released the
Sandbox, we've added a number


203
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,546
of enhancements based on
community feedback and requests.


204
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:42,916
The Sandbox currently supports
a mobile UI, multiple UI themes,


205
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,336
autosaving of code,
and the ability


206
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,586
to select multiple
Swift runtimes.


207
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:52,836
Also, to help developers to
share questions and solutions


208
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,796
around Swift, we added code
snapshot support that's backed


209
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,016
by a persistent URL.


210
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:01,936
You could use this to share
code across mailing lists


211
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,576
and developer forums
like stackoverflow.com.


212
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,816
Thank you, and we've seen
over 1.5 million executions


213
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:17,286
in the Sandbox since we
launched in December,


214
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,406
and this is over
200 percent increase


215
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,616
since just this February.


216
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,656
And the Sandbox is
unlocking access


217
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,976
to Swift from other platforms.


218
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:33,496
In fact, we're seeing
steady growth and interest


219
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:36,126
in executions and
sessions coming


220
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,706
from other operating systems.


221
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,286
We're very pleased to see this,


222
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,176
and we'd like to see
Swift grow even more.


223
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,196
We're also seeing usage
from around the globe.


224
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,456
Developers using the Sandbox
to learn Swift and collaborate.


225
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:54,336
Our intent is to continue
to support the Sandbox


226
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:56,566
to help grow the community.


227
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:03,206
A vibrant package ecosystem
is critical to any language.


228
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,706
While the Swift Package Manager
specification is an early


229
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,066
technology, everything
that we're doing


230
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,256
on the server is based on
the creation and composition


231
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:14,526
of Swift-based packages.


232
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,276
Because of this, we found
the need to both discover


233
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,586
and to publish our own packages.


234
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,806
So we created the Swift package
catalog to help with this goal.


235
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,826
We continue to update
the package catalog


236
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:30,346
as the Swift Package Manager
specification evolves.


237
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:36,156
And today we have over 1,500
Swift Package Manager compliant


238
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,936
packages on the catalog,


239
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:41,366
and this is up 400
percent since February.


240
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,866
Next, when we start
thinking about servers,


241
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,876
a foundational requirement


242
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,256
for any server language
is the ability


243
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:52,976
to stand up web interfaces.


244
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,406
While web frameworks are
responsible for listening


245
00:12:56,406 --> 00:13:00,086
on ports and routing code
to the appropriate logic,


246
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:03,576
we thought it was very
important for that logic to be


247
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,176
as consistent as possible


248
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:06,846
with the client-side
programming model.


249
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,866
And towards that end, we
created the Kitura framework.


250
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,146
We open source Kitura
in February.


251
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,496
It's a modular package
based web framework.


252
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:21,296
It leverages libdispatch and
Foundation for concurrency


253
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,026
and utility library support.


254
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:28,686
It's also driving IBM's
contributions to Swift.org.


255
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:33,626
We're using Kitura to build
our service-side applications,


256
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,836
and we're working with the
community and have a number


257
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:40,306
of committers outside of IBM
working on Kitura actively.


258
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,946
It's an important part
of what we're doing


259
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,646
to server enable Swift.


260
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:51,066
We're also optimizing our Cloud
for Swift-based workloads.


261
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,556
And I'm pleased to
announce our latest updates


262
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,616
to our Cloud foundry-based
build packs for Bluemix


263
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,776
that includes everything
that you need


264
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:03,286
to rapidly deploy your
Kitura-based applications


265
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,356
to the IBM Cloud.


266
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:08,326
These build packs include the
very latest Swift runtimes,


267
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:11,956
core libraries, and
dependent C libraries.


268
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,376
They're needed to deploy
Kitura to the Cloud.


269
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:20,566
But in addition, development
is, is key, and we're pleased


270
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,076
to announce IBM Cloud
tools for Swift,


271
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,906
a Mac companion application
to allow you


272
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,606
to easily build end-to-end
applications in Swift.


273
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,396
The tool helps you to quickly


274
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:35,056
and easily connect
your client-side apps


275
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,756
with service-side Swift
that runs in the IBM Cloud.


276
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,606
Just continue developing
your projects, your client


277
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:45,756
and service-side projects
in Xcode, and use this tool


278
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:49,636
to link those projects and
deploy your code to the server.


279
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,496
Now with that introduction, I'd
like to welcome my colleague,


280
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,896
Patrick Bohrer, up to the stage


281
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,706
who will show you
service-side Swift in action.


282
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:05,126
[ Applause ]


283
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,116
>> Thanks, John.


284
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,146
I'm Pat Bohrer.


285
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,026
I'm the Technical Lead for a lot


286
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,886
of the fun stuff we're
doing at IBM around Swift.


287
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:14,566
So we're thrilled to be
here at WWDC, and I'm going


288
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,356
to be leading what
I call the fun


289
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:17,686
and exciting part
of the session.


290
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,926
It's fun because I'm going to be
doing some live coding of Swift


291
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,506
on the server, and it's
exciting because both


292
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,876
of my demos are dependent on a
working network to the Cloud.


293
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,756
So wish me luck.


294
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,366
So as we talk about server-side
Swift, it can mean a lot


295
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,666
of things to a lot of
people, but for this audience


296
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,466
and for this session,


297
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:39,506
we're really talking
about web services.


298
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,806
So what are web services?


299
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,516
In a very simple
level, they're programs


300
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:46,906
that are off running
in a machine.


301
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,456
They're listening.


302
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,526
They're listening for
incoming requests.


303
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,056
They're responsible for
routing those requests


304
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:56,236
to some server-side logic,
and return and response.


305
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,326
And now as far as what's out
there, it could be a browser,


306
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,596
it could be another application.


307
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:01,836
Who knows?


308
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,856
It could be another service,


309
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,126
but as simple level,
that's what it is.


310
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,846
So to get started, that
sounds simple enough.


311
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:14,366
Let's go ahead and jump in,
and do a live demo of that.


312
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,266
OK. So as I mentioned,


313
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,496
oftentimes these web
services are running on Linux,


314
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,926
and we've heard about
Swift running on Linux.


315
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,426
So let's go ahead
and do our work


316
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,346
for this first demo
on Linus itself.


317
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,596
Let's go ahead and do that.


318
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:29,966
So here we have Linux
and running.


319
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,516
Make sure I'm not lying.


320
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,526
So let's go ahead and
create a directory


321
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,886
to do some, to play around.


322
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,256
So we'll very creatively
create a play directory.


323
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,556
You can see we have
nothing in here.


324
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,446
And now we'll use the
Swift Package Manager.


325
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:46,206
So every, as John mentioned,
everything we're doing


326
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,146
on server-side is
based on packages.


327
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:51,296
And so we're going to
use, this is a version


328
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:54,526
of the Swift Package Manager
that, for those watching later,


329
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:58,136
this syntax changes, but for the
version that we're using today,


330
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,456
it has an initialization step.


331
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,706
And so if we issue this command,


332
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,826
we can see that it's
created a few files.


333
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:10,195
So based on the structure
and the Package.Swift file,


334
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,606
the Swift Package Manager knows
how to build your application.


335
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:17,976
And so as you can see here,
we have a Package.Swift,


336
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:21,935
and it's created a Sources.main,
and that's all we really need


337
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,146
to build a Swift, a
simple Swift package.


338
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,906
So with that said, let's
go ahead and build this.


339
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:30,586
So we can issue Swift build,
and that was easy enough.


340
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,386
And so it's created a
.build/debug play executable.


341
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,056
So let's run that.


342
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,396
Ah. Hello world.


343
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,196
But we're building web services.


344
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:49,776
So let's get real.


345
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:53,496
OK. So here, this is what
our Swift Package Manager has


346
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:54,186
created for us.


347
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,956
So, again, it's best that
we have a package based


348
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,296
on our directory called Plays.


349
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,816
It's named our executed play,


350
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,036
and so that's why
that got named.


351
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:05,536
And we want to add one piece
here, and that's a dependency


352
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:08,616
on Kitura, and that's
all we need to specify.


353
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:15,276
So now we will go
to our main file.


354
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,346
Let's delete our
old hello world,


355
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:20,226
and let's add a bit
of code here.


356
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,926
So what this code does
is, again, old faithful.


357
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,026
We're pulling in Foundation.


358
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,216
We're also importing
Kitura and a couple


359
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:30,116
of Kitura support packages.


360
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,716
Here, we're specifying a
router, as I mentioned,


361
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:34,686
for incoming requests.


362
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,106
We have to route these
requests somewhere.


363
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,126
And we're going to
specify one route,


364
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,706
right here, that is /hello.


365
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:45,726
So if any, if any requests
come in, we'll run this code.


366
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:46,796
Simple enough.


367
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,436
We'll specify some
response headers,


368
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,086
and we'll send back a
string saying hello world.


369
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,286
Now down here we specify
what port we'll listen to,


370
00:18:56,286 --> 00:19:00,526
and it's the 8095, and we
start listening on this port,


371
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,086
and we specify our
router as a delegate,


372
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,166
and then we start the server.


373
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:04,726
So it's pretty simple.


374
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:10,186
Let's go ahead and save that.


375
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:15,256
Now we're going to build
Kitura for the first time,


376
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,246
and so we've added
some pieces here.


377
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:18,026
As John mentioned,


378
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,706
we're leveraging
libdispatch and Foundation.


379
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,656
And so what it's doing
is it's pulling down,


380
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,116
the Swift Package Manager's
pulling down everything we need.


381
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,946
So we wrote the code
we care about,


382
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,626
and the Swift Package Manager
is pulling down Kitura,


383
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,016
it's pulling down our
networking, it's pulling


384
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:35,046
down some system support,
a logger, all the things


385
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:39,426
that you'd need in a, in a web
service, as well as the ability


386
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,566
to listen on sockets
and everything else.


387
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,966
And so each of these are
discrete packages that are


388
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,256
out on GitHub that
you can pull in.


389
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,326
And it's compiled and built.


390
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:56,786
So now let's go ahead and
run this executable again.


391
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,256
So we can see that it's now,


392
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,976
it just says it's
listing on port 8095.


393
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:07,306
So let's go ahead and
take a look at that.


394
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,126
We'll bring up local host 8095
because it's running locally


395
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,916
on our, on our Mac and Linux,


396
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,836
and you can see we
see a Kitura page.


397
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:17,216
So this basically, if we haven't
defined the default route,


398
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,916
it'll bring up this page


399
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,236
and specify other
ways to get started.


400
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,546
You can always override this,


401
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,656
but for us all we've
specified is hello.


402
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:33,526
[ Applause ]


403
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,386
And so, of course, the
first thing you have


404
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,646
to do is say hello world, right.


405
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,626
So the first step, but,
really, when you, when you think


406
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,806
about it, let's go back,
we'll do a bit more here.


407
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,926
Let's go back and
edit our main file.


408
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,646
We have a lot of
that we can use here.


409
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,996
So we have Foundation,


410
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,176
and we also have the
ability to generate JSON.


411
00:20:54,176 --> 00:21:00,116
So add a little helper code here
to help us create a JSON string.


412
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:03,566
We'll also add a new
route called today.


413
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:09,186
So now, again, here's a new
route that if anything comes in,


414
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,666
saying /today, it'll do,
it'll leverage Foundation


415
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,106
to go get the current date.


416
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,876
We'll go ahead and create
an NSDateFormatter just


417
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,986
like we would on the client.


418
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:20,836
We'll use that DateFormatter
to create a date string,


419
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:25,196
a time string, and now we'll get
into the meat of our response,


420
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,816
and so here we'll create a
payload which, is a dictionary,


421
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:31,536
and now because in the Internet,
you know, it's all JSON.


422
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,976
So we specify message is hello
world, our date is our date,


423
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,086
our time is our time,
and, again,


424
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,256
we convert that into a string,


425
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,106
and that's what we
send back this time.


426
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,736
So let's take, see
what that works.


427
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,826
Let's go ahead and rebuild.


428
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:47,436
Much faster.


429
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:48,446
All the packages are here.


430
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:49,486
So that's good.


431
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,086
So, again, we'll run this again.


432
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:55,126
You can see we're
listing on 8095.


433
00:21:56,026 --> 00:22:00,176
We'll reload and see we're still
responding hello world on hello,


434
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,826
and now let's look at today.


435
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,606
And there we go.


436
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:05,776
We have our JSON payload.


437
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,686
And now, again, every time
someone comes in here, it's,


438
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:15,976
it's executing that code,
and it's return and response.


439
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,856
So that's at a very simple
level how to get started.


440
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,406
OK. My wife said to take
off the glasses [inaudible].


441
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:32,996
So that was pretty fun, but now
let's make this a little bit


442
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:33,646
more interesting.


443
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,916
So as we go through, first
I'd like to introduce you


444
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,146
to a really interesting sample
that we've made available


445
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:40,916
to this community, and
it's called BluePic.


446
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,426
So BluePic is a sample
photosharing application


447
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:45,996
that's social.


448
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:51,346
It has a rich client interface,
a very beautiful interface


449
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:54,406
that we've built and provided
as part of this overall sample.


450
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:59,106
It also has a really
interesting backend.


451
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:03,906
That is, a Swift server backend,
pure Swift using Kitura,


452
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:07,336
running the IBM Cloud, and it's
also leveraging some interesting


453
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:10,856
services that I'll mentioned
like Watson or ObjectStore,


454
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,636
[inaudible] SQL databases,
all that good stuff.


455
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,686
And if you're, if you're
ready to dive deeper,


456
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:22,296
it even has some use of
IBM's brand-new event driven


457
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:23,916
programming model
called OpenWhisk


458
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:25,406
that also supports Swift.


459
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,696
So, again, this package
has a lot going on,


460
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,046
and it's available now
on GitHub for those


461
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:31,766
who want to get started.


462
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,006
So before we dive
into demo mode here,


463
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,236
I want to spend a little
bit of time talking


464
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,316
about the design pattern here.


465
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:42,966
So unlike before where we had a
web browser as the client-side,


466
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,726
we, of course, have
an iOS application.


467
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,636
It has our model
view controllers,


468
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,736
and you can see it also
has a networking interface


469
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:50,996
with requests and responses.


470
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,716
And it's talking to
our Swift middle tier,


471
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,226
which is similar to
what we just did.


472
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,516
It's just a little bit more
interesting, but, again,


473
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:59,666
accepting an incoming
route request,


474
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:01,256
routing those to some logic.


475
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:04,936
And then, finally, we
also have another piece


476
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,876
where we have some interesting
services, which we'll get


477
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:10,396
into in a bit, for holding all
of this data of our application.


478
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,166
So, again, just to dig
a little bit deeper.


479
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,866
So we have the client-side.


480
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,276
It's responsible.


481
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:20,786
It's very user specific view
driven for rendering some nice,


482
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:23,806
you know, interactions
with the, with the user


483
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:26,126
of the application, and
then we have the midtier.


484
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,506
The midtier is responding
to all of the clients


485
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,416
with the things they have,


486
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:31,686
but it's also doing some
really interesting things.


487
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:36,106
So as photos get submitted
into the midtier, it can,


488
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,396
it'll accept those photos.


489
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:39,216
It'll save them into
ObjectStore.


490
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,056
It'll create some
metadata around them,


491
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,506
but it'll do a few other things
that are pretty interesting.


492
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:46,556
So it will take those
photos, and submit it


493
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,686
over to Watson's Vision Insights


494
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,216
and extract just tags
about the photos.


495
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,836
Is it mountains and lakes and
all that good stuff, right.


496
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,366
So it's kind of adding
the special sauce


497
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,216
to our application
from the midtier.


498
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,746
It will also notice
where the photo is taken


499
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:02,616
and call Watson's
Weather Insights,


500
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:03,786
and pull down information.


501
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,356
What was the weather
like at that location?


502
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:06,576
So we're adding all of that.


503
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:08,556
So, again, instead of
making all these round trips


504
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:11,036
from the client-side, we're
making it from the server-side,


505
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:13,416
which is always on, always
available to go ahead


506
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,936
and do our service
composition there.


507
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:19,056
And the fact that this is
end-to-end Swift lets us deploy


508
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:22,646
the right code to
the right place.


509
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,436
So now here is BluePic
off running in the wild.


510
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,516
It's running on a device.


511
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:29,436
It's connecting into
the, you know, the Cloud.


512
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,956
The application server,
which is then talking


513
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,766
to all the different services
I mentioned, and that's great.


514
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,476
Now if something comes
up, and we have to debug


515
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:40,046
or develop this application
further, what do we do?


516
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:43,376
Right. Well, as iOS developers,
we know exactly what to do.


517
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,296
We pull down the source for
that application onto our Mac,


518
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,836
we load it all up into Xcode,
and we're good to go, right.


519
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:50,966
We can debug this.


520
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:52,876
We can debug the application.


521
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,616
You can even be calling
out into the Cloud


522
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:55,806
and making other requests.


523
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:57,856
So this is something we
know how to do today,


524
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,526
but now that this midtier
is also running Swift,


525
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:01,336
what do we do?


526
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,016
Right. You probably don't want


527
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,546
to be using VI like
I was on Linux.


528
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:09,176
But, again, we can
do the same thing.


529
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:13,076
We can pull down the source code
for our server-side code, again,


530
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:15,586
onto our Mac, load
it up in Xcode,


531
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:18,246
and now we can also just
do normal development


532
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,556
and debug locally on our Mac.


533
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:20,926
So we're debugging
and developing.


534
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:24,266
It's exciting.


535
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:30,376
So now our development world
got a whole lot bigger, right.


536
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,806
So we actually control
everything from end to end,


537
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,456
from the client to the midtier,


538
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,156
even to the services
that we touch.


539
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,726
So we, we really are
excited about this


540
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:41,596
because we think it brings
down that development cycle of,


541
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,576
you know, as you're doing things
on the client, and you want


542
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,396
to add some capabilities
on the backend,


543
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,296
it's all in the world
that you understand.


544
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,076
Towards that end, as
developers ourselves,


545
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,776
we thought we can go
a little bit further.


546
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,536
So just like we've done
with the package catalog


547
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,386
and the Swift Sandbox,


548
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,716
we created this application
called IBM Cloud Tools for Swift


549
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:03,466
as a Mac application to
help us manage this bigger


550
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,146
development world.


551
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:08,416
So we're really excited
about it.


552
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:11,346
This application actually
makes it possible for us


553
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:15,836
to manage this entire stack
end-to-end, and we, you know,


554
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,966
there's a lot of things
that we could do by hand,


555
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,546
but why not have some tools
to help you with this, right.


556
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,426
So we're excited to hear
your feedback on this just


557
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,336
like we have the
Sandbox and the catalog.


558
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,126
And we'll keep, you know,
we're just getting started


559
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:32,196
with this application, and,
again, as developers ourselves,


560
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,716
we know what we want it to do.


561
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,916
We'll keep adding things, and
we'll listen to this community


562
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,606
as well, but we're
really excited


563
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:38,646
about the possibilities here.


564
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,856
So our goal is really to
empower this community


565
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:45,186
to keep creating great
applications, and now powered


566
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:48,126
by Swift on the server.


567
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:50,976
So now with all of that
background, let's actually jump


568
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:52,116
in and do some demos again.


569
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,296
Going to show you just
how bright this future is


570
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:55,806le
with Swift.


571
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:05,886
OK. So first off, this is the
IBM Cloud Tools for Swift.


572
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,906
If you want to get
started, it presents you


573
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,986
with an interface that's
a nice rich interface,


574
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,896
and for those wanting to
get started with BluePic,


575
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:18,126
it even has an ability to
create a BluePic project


576
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:22,016
to create just a Kitura project
or to create an empty project.


577
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,556
Now the part that's interesting


578
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,276
about this is not only is it
doing a clone of these projects


579
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,086
in bringing them down, it's also


580
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,836
under the covers provisioning
resources in the IBM Cloud


581
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,406
to deploy that project when
you're ready, and it will,


582
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:37,266
in fact, when you create these,
it will go ahead and deploy it


583
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:39,526
because it knows it's
a working example.


584
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,866
So, again, to get up
and running quickly,


585
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,556
it's a great way to start.


586
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,406
For us, we've already created
a BluePic application here,


587
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:52,476
and you can see we
have a demo BluePic.


588
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:54,296
Very cleverly named.


589
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,166
And here you can see we
have a client application,


590
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,216
a binding between a client
application and a Cloud runtime.


591
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,466
Both of these are in Swift.


592
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:06,336
Additionally, if we drill in,
here to the server-side code,


593
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,076
you can see it has a reference
to where the code is locally


594
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:12,626
on our, on my machine as well
as a binding to where it goes


595
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,446
into the Cloud as well as all of
the services that is provisioned


596
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:18,266
on behalf of this application.


597
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:21,946
So, again, I can manage all
of this locally on my Mac.


598
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:28,566
As well as I can go ahead and
launch with one click into Xcode


599
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:29,786
to look at my client-side.


600
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,046
So here's the BluePic
client-side application.


601
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:40,096
It is also created, let me zoom
in here a little bit, this file.


602
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,726
It's a Bluemix.plist.


603
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,476
Knowing this development
cycle, being able to run


604
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,796
against your Cloud
services locally


605
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:50,236
versus remotely it's very
easy to control this.


606
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:55,396
It'll either listen locally to
8090 or remotely out in Bluemix


607
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:57,206
and pass in the,
the credentials.


608
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,426
So, again, the thought here
is to make this really simple.


609
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,916
So here we'll go ahead and
run this, and so let's imagine


610
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:10,436
that somebody's filed a bug
report about the application.


611
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,806
So here's our application.


612
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,556
Again, it's got a
nice pretty interface.


613
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,026
We can scroll through.


614
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,436
We can see some pictures.


615
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:18,896
If we click on these pictures,


616
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,326
we can see there's
more information.


617
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,996
So the name is nature
of this one.


618
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,076
We can see who took it.


619
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,536
We can see, supposedly,
this was in Austin, Texas,


620
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,656
which we don't have mountains.


621
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:31,316
So. We can also see what
the weather was like,


622
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,586
and then thanks to
Watson Insight,


623
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,706
we see that there's
a few tags here.


624
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:36,576
So this is interesting.


625
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,726
If I click on tags, I
can see, OK, here's the,


626
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:40,376
we have one photo
that has a lake.


627
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,086
If I go back, let's
click on mountain,


628
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:46,126
and we can see there's a few
photos that have mountains, and,


629
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:48,766
again, all of this was done
by integration on the backend.


630
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:50,446
We didn't have users
having to tag this.


631
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:51,786
This was just auto extracted.


632
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,166
But we heard that
there's some complaint


633
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,546
about when I click cloudy skies.


634
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,346
So let's look at that.


635
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,736
So we click cloudy sky,
and we don't see anything.


636
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,736
So we know what's going on here,


637
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,786
and somehow the server's not
returning the right results.


638
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,606
So now let's switch.


639
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,776
We want to go ahead and figure
out, get to the bottom of this.


640
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,196
And so we'll go over
here, and we'll click


641
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,226
on our server-side code.


642
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:18,656
It will launch us and
show us the directory


643
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,176
where the server-side code is.


644
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:23,426
And if I go ahead and
load that into a terminal,


645
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,416
you can see a lot of the
same files as I mentioned,


646
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,426
we're doing Swift
3.0 on the server.


647
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:32,096
We have our Package.Swift.


648
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,316
We have our sources.


649
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,366
But, additionally,
I went through


650
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,926
and created an Xcode project
of the server-side code.


651
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,526
So let's go ahead and open that.


652
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:45,236
So here's the code, and, again,
here's a get handler for images.


653
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:48,006
So we know that when we
want images, our image feed,


654
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,156
we'll call this get
on/images on our server.


655
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,376
So if we look at this, we want
to go through and say, OK, well,


656
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,046
somehow when we pass in a tag,


657
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,876
we're not returning
the right results.


658
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:01,426
So let's set a break point
here, and we'll run our server.


659
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:08,256
And now we can see our server is
listening locally on port 8090.


660
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:11,626
Now let's switch back.


661
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:19,146
So here we're going to have our
client application say local is


662
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,886
yes so that it will actually
connect to our local server,


663
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,976
and let's rerun the simulator.


664
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:28,966
By the way, I'm getting
far too lucky


665
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,416
with all this network
connectivity.


666
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,306
So keep up whatever
you're doing.


667
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,796
OK. So let's just scroll down
to the file we had a little


668
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:37,806
problems with.


669
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:38,626
Let's click on here.


670
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,136
Let's click on cloudy skies.


671
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,126
Ah, great.


672
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:44,906
Here, we hit a break
point in the server.


673
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:49,646
[ Applause ]


674
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:54,456
So if we want to get a feel
for what's happening here,


675
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:55,636
and say we want to print tag.


676
00:32:55,636 --> 00:33:01,166
And we can see, kind
of hard to see that.


677
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,126
We can see that the
string is coming


678
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,386
in as cloudy percent 20 sky.


679
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,436
That's no good.


680
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:07,126
We don't want that.


681
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:10,046
So let's take a look at that.


682
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,766
We also know that we
have Foundation here.


683
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,366
So what if we go ahead
and use Foundation


684
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,106
to clean this up a bit.


685
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,566
We'll remove the
percent in coding.


686
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:25,846
Oh, this is now a variable
instead of a [inaudible].


687
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:30,356
Let's go ahead and build this.


688
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,486
We'll run it again.


689
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:33,446
Rerun the server.


690
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,156
Let's go back to
our application.


691
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:41,886
Oh. There we go.


692
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:43,696
Timed out waiting for us.


693
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,336
Let's go back.


694
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:50,136
Let's click cloudy sky again,
and see if we fixed our problem.


695
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,266
Print to tag.


696
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:53,896
Ah, much better.


697
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:54,986
That's what we want.


698
00:33:54,986 --> 00:34:01,046
So let's go ahead and turn off
this break point and continue.


699
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:07,976
And we see we got our result.


700
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:14,335
[ Applause ]


701
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,326
So now additionally, since
we've fixed this problem,


702
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:21,106
I can go back into
Cloud Tools for Swift,


703
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:25,266
and I can do a redeploy of
this state out to the server.


704
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:27,446
So it will start redeploying
that code right away.


705
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:30,686
So, again, it's that simple
to work with your client-side


706
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:32,976
and your server-side and
redeploy to the Cloud.


707
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:40,315
[ Applause ]


708
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:43,766
So I hope you really like these
demos, and I got to tell you,


709
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,946
I feel a tremendous amount of
relief that everything worked.


710
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:51,406
So on behalf of IBM,
John and I would just


711
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,556
like to thank everyone
for their time.


712
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,596
This is a really exciting
time to be a Swift developer,


713
00:34:57,176 --> 00:35:01,756
and we invite you to join us and
the broader community to join in


714
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:05,616
and bring, to bring the
power of Swift to the server.


715
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,526
And for more information about
anything you've heard here,


716
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,656
about what we're,
what's cooking at IBM,


717
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:14,036
we have our
developer.IBM.com/Swift Dev


718
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:16,436
Center that you can go to.


719
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:17,576
And with that, thanks again.


720
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:18,546
I'll hand it back to Philippe.


721
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:26,796
[ Applause ]


722
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:30,696
>> So as you can see, IBM has
been doing some really awesome


723
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:31,626
things with Swift.


724
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,606
They've not just been
contributing some great code,


725
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,746
but they've also been
enriching the community


726
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,726
with their vast experience
building services


727
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:40,386
and streamlining
development flows.


728
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,606
Some of their work
has been integral


729
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,716
in making server-side
Swift possible.


730
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:49,126
But you, too, can help make
server-side Swift a reality,


731
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,946
and there are a number of things


732
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:53,156
that definitely you
can contribute with.


733
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:56,566
Portions of Swift
are not yet finished.


734
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,806
There's a lot of work to be
done, and there are a few things


735
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:01,416
that are not yet
to be implemented,


736
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,086
and unimplemented just means
an opportunity to contribute.


737
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:07,856
There are number of easy ways
that you can help pitch in.


738
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:12,266
The bug tracker even has a
category for issues tagged


739
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:15,856
as starter bugs, but code
isn't just implementations.


740
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:19,296
Designing new API's and
guidelines that will work well


741
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,406
in Swift are something
that are being worked


742
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:23,926
on on a daily basis
in the e-mail list.


743
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,516
Many of the discussions are
working on the language itself,


744
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,756
and coming from contributors
like you.


745
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:34,856
And, of course, your packages,
your applications are what going


746
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,386
to make Swift on
the server awesome.


747
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:42,066
And if you have any questions
as for resources or links


748
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,876
to what we've actually talked
here today, we've got a,


749
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:48,306
this session, we have
everything culminated together,


750
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:52,736
and there are number of other
really awesome related sessions


751
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:54,626
that I would highly
suggest watching.


752
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:58,616
The API design guidelines
can, goes over some


753
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:03,176
of our thoughts behind actually
the new naming within Swift 3,


754
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:07,256
and I would highly suggest
that you take a look


755
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,186
at the What's New in
Foundation for Swift.


756
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:12,666
All of the new value
types and features


757
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,086
that are being added are
going to be available


758
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,186
on the server as well.


759
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,206
Of course, performance is
not just necessarily your


760
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,216
local application.


761
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:22,576
We all, we need to
be able to make sure


762
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,186
that our servers are going
to be responsive and quick.


763
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:29,606
So performance, all across the
board, both on Linux and Mac is,


764
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,716
by far, something to look into,
and I would highly suggest


765
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:36,886
to take a look at the
new, new things in GCD


766
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:38,956
that are being released
with Swift 3.


767
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,976
And with that, thank
you very much.
