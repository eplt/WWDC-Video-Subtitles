00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:30,896
>> Good afternoon and welcome to


4
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,916
Getting the Most out of


5
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,526
Playgrounds in Xcode.


6
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,006
My name is Tibet Rooney-Rabdau


7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,096
and with me today are my


8
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,986
teammates Alex Brown and TJ


9
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:38,376
Usiyan.


10
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:41,296
I love that every time I have a


11
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:42,986
new coding idea I can jump right


12
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,256
into a playground to try it out.


13
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:46,806
In today's session we will share


14
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:48,076
with you our favorite work


15
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:48,456
flows.


16
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:50,666
This is a great session for


17
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,866
those not too familiar with


18
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,706
playgrounds in Xcode, as well as


19
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:54,536
those diving deeper.


20
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:57,996
We're going to start out todays


21
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:58,956
talk with playground


22
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:01,386
fundamentals, a brief overview


23
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,236
of playgrounds, markup, and


24
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:04,286
imbedded resources.


25
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,636
Then we'll show you how to run


26
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:08,016
step-by-step in a playground.


27
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,226
We'll discuss tips to give you


28
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,826
more control of your code


29
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:12,586
execution.


30
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:15,456
Lastly we'll finish with


31
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:17,426
advanced techniques including


32
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:18,636
the wonderful world of Custom


33
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:19,926
Playground Display Convertible.


34
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:22,146
We will use this protocol to


35
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:23,856
customize your inline results.


36
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,886
We will also discuss how to use


37
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,516
workspaces to exercise code in


38
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:30,406
your frameworks.


39
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:33,636
Playgrounds provides an


40
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,026
interactive place to explore


41
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:36,416
Swift, create learning


42
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,336
environments or others, and


43
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:40,516
prototype parts of your app.


44
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:41,776
Let's get started with a quick


45
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,436
tour of Playgrounds in Xcode.


46
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:47,916
When you first open a


47
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,616
playground, Xcode shows you the


48
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:50,516
standard editor.


49
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,736
This is the basic editor mode


50
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,646
you use in Xcode with a couple


51
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:55,286
additions.


52
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:57,726
What is unique about this editor


53
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,426
when you're in a playground is


54
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:00,866
the result sidebar on the right


55
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,736
hands side displaying the result


56
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,236
of each expression in your code.


57
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,836
You also have the ability to add


58
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,716
these results as inline results.


59
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,246
This is done by selecting the


60
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,256
rectangular button beside your


61
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,476
result in the result sidebar.


62
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,276
This will then show your result


63
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:22,916
inline with your Swift Code.


64
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,406
In this example you can see this


65
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:25,646
demonstrated where "Hello,


66
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,746
playground" is added below our


67
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,236
string variable declaration.


68
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:32,416
Let's take a look at the


69
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,526
assistant editor mode.


70
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,156
What is interesting about this


71
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,146
mode in Playgrounds in Xcode is


72
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,186
that you can visualize your


73
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:41,136
results in more detail by using


74
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:41,616
a live view.


75
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:45,426
In this example I've created a


76
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,126
live view using UIView that


77
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,256
shows a welcome message.


78
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:50,156
But you could also use


79
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,526
UIViewController for iOS and


80
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:54,046
[inaudible] playgrounds and for


81
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:56,426
macOS playgrounds NSView and


82
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,126
NSViewController.


83
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:03,336
Now let me show you a short


84
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,536
snippet that demonstrates how to


85
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:05,506
show Live View.


86
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,946
First you need to import


87
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:08,806
PlaygroundSupport.


88
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:11,836
PlaygroundSupport is a framework


89
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,626
provided by Xcode to allow


90
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,796
playgrounds to interact with


91
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:16,896
Xcode, including support for


92
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,726
showing live views.


93
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,086
You import this playground


94
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,656
support framework so you can use


95
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,056
its API.


96
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,546
Once you've created a


97
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:25,896
viewController using the


98
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,926
standard UIKit or AppKit APIs,


99
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:29,616
you need to hand it over to the


100
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:30,876
PlaygroundSupport framework.


101
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,266
You do this by setting the Live


102
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,776
View property of the current


103
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,016
playground page to your


104
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:36,666
viewController.


105
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:38,996
This signals to Xcode that it


106
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,126
should show your viewController


107
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,546
in the assistant editor.


108
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,736
To give your playgrounds an


109
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,316
extra bit of polish, you can


110
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:47,776
include some markup text.


111
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,626
It is especially great when


112
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,446
you're making a playground to


113
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:50,986
share with others.


114
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:53,476
With markup you can include


115
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,196
stylized text, images, and video


116
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:56,946
in your playground.


117
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,296
Now let's take a quick


118
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,686
walkthrough what is possible


119
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:01,336
with markup.


120
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,356
Here I've included some markup


121
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,736
comments with text for a poem


122
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,346
I'm writing.


123
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:09,436
A markup comment is like a


124
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:11,326
regular comment but with a colon


125
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:12,526
after the forward slashes.


126
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,516
The rest of the comment is then


127
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,786
treated as markup text.


128
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,576
If you have multiple lines of


129
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,375
comments next to each other they


130
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,536
form one block of markup text.


131
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,166
You can also use multiline


132
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,806
comments by putting a colon


133
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,096
after the first asterisks.


134
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,936
Here's our markup in Xcode now.


135
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:36,236
It is showing the raw markup of


136
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:36,996
the poem I wrote.


137
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,766
To show it in its rendered form,


138
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,526
select the button in the top


139
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:42,586
right corner of the window,


140
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:44,696
which shows Xcode's Inspector.


141
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,936
Then select Render Documentation


142
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:49,316
under Playground Settings.


143
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,396
The lines in my poem are now


144
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:52,876
rendered.


145
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:56,746
Other interesting things you can


146
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:57,866
do with the markup are adding


147
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,446
headings to a Playground peach.


148
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:01,356
You can use headings to create


149
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:02,676
structure in your playground.


150
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,476
You can use number signs to


151
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,146
supply up to three levels of


152
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:06,566
heading.


153
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,136
In this example the title of my


154
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:12,206
poem "Roses are Red" as a first


155
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:15,006
level heading, the subtitle, "An


156
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,706
Ode to Markup" as a second level


157
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:19,266
heading, and the byline as a


158
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:20,156
third level heading.


159
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:22,786
Remember to add at least one


160
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,006
space between the number sign


161
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:24,816
and the heading string,


162
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:25,996
otherwise you'll have a number


163
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:26,906
sign connected to your heading


164
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:27,416
when rendered.


165
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,666
This is what the headings look


166
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,936
like rendered when included with


167
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:32,916
the lines in my poem.


168
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:34,876
You can see that the first level


169
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,656
heading is largest, followed by


170
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,226
the second level, and then the


171
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,066
third level heading.


172
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,416
You can also format the text in


173
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:42,956
your markup content.


174
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:45,876
You can wrap a string of


175
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,926
characters on a single asterisk


176
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,226
on each side to italicize the


177
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,486
text between the asterisks.


178
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,286
You can also use backticks to


179
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,406
display text with Code Font.


180
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,156
Finally, if you use two


181
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,836
asterisks instead of one the


182
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:00,776
text will be bold.


183
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:02,646
Let's take a look at this


184
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:03,036
rendered.


185
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,136
You can see that red and blue


186
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:08,096
are italicized.


187
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:11,196
Markup is in Code Font and fun


188
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:11,846
is in bold.


189
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,616
Let's take a look at using lists


190
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,346
in markup.


191
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:18,966
If a markup comment starts with


192
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,446
a number followed by a period,


193
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,306
it will create an item in a


194
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,406
numbered list.


195
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:25,966
In this example, I've added the


196
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,816
lines of my poem to a numbered


197
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:29,466
list.


198
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,536
Here you can see the lines of my


199
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,336
poem rendered in a number list,


200
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,906
each line representing an item


201
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,206
in a numbered list.


202
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,866
You can also create a bullet to


203
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,786
list in markup.


204
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,536
A bulleted list is like a number


205
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,996
list except each line starts


206
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,286
with an asterisks instead of a


207
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:45,616
number.


208
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,056
This is how my poem in rendered


209
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:51,076
in a bulleted list with each


210
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,516
line in my poem represented as a


211
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,276
bulleted item in a bulletin


212
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:54,446
list.


213
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,846
Markup can also contain links.


214
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:01,456
In this example I've created a


215
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,286
link to roses and violets.


216
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:05,736
To create a link you wrap the


217
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:07,536
text in brackets and then place


218
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,756
the destination of the link in


219
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,536
parentheses after.


220
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,546
Another way you can create a


221
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,466
link is by using a reference.


222
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,396
In this example I've created a


223
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,416
reference named 1, but this can


224
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,246
be any string.


225
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:21,306
It doesn't have to be a number.


226
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,416
When creating and using a link


227
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,036
reference you wrap the name in


228
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:26,786
brackets.


229
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,426
When creating a reference you


230
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:29,606
add a colon and then the


231
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:30,646
destination to the link.


232
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,446
Here are the links represented


233
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:37,226
in rendered form, Roses,


234
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,446
Violets, and Fun are shown in


235
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,836
blue to represent a link.


236
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,606
Up to this point we treated a


237
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,436
playground as a single location,


238
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,206
but playgrounds can contain


239
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,336
multiple pages, each with their


240
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,756
own markup and code.


241
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,746
To create a new playground page,


242
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:56,406
select the playground and then


243
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,426
open the file menu.


244
00:07:58,026 --> 00:07:59,496
Select New, then Playground


245
00:07:59,496 --> 00:07:59,926
Page.


246
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:02,086
You could also create a


247
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,586
playground page by control


248
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,206
clicking on the playground and


249
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,296
then selecting New Playground


250
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:06,796
Page.


251
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:10,246
You can create links in your


252
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,966
markup, which navigate between


253
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:12,296
pages.


254
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:15,636
To go to the previous page, you


255
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:16,516
can create a link where the


256
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:18,306
destination is @previous.


257
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:21,036
To go to the next page you can


258
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:21,686
create a link where the


259
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,186
destination is @next.


260
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:25,996
Finally, if you want to navigate


261
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,866
to a specific page, you create a


262
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,896
link where the destination is


263
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,656
the file name for that page


264
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,515
without the extension and by


265
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,395
replacing any spaces or special


266
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,186
characters with their percent in


267
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:36,946
coded form.


268
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,716
You can also imbed some


269
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:41,895
additional content to make you


270
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,436
playgrounds even more powerful.


271
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,066
You can add additional Swift


272
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,426
files to the sources folder,


273
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:48,976
which is at the top level of the


274
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:49,506
playground.


275
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,526
Each page also has its own


276
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:53,336
sources folder.


277
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,086
Sources are compiled as separate


278
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,466
modules where they are


279
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,536
automatically imported where


280
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,036
visible so you don't have to


281
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,386
handle import statements.


282
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:03,576
Since these are compiled as


283
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:05,536
separate modules, you can use


284
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,486
access control to control what


285
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,446
is exported from your axillary


286
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:09,996
sources.


287
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:13,196
Anything you want to use as your


288
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,856
main playground source should be


289
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:15,696
marked as Public.


290
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,246
A great example of things to put


291
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:19,956
into the sources folder is


292
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,546
helper code such as classes or


293
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,476
extensions that are outside of


294
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,316
the main playground.


295
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,076
Playgrounds can also contain


296
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,206
other resources.


297
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,786
Resources are any other file


298
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:34,886
that you'd like to use in your


299
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,076
playground such as images,


300
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,356
audio, video, storyboards, and


301
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:38,806
ZIPs.


302
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,476
Just like sources, there's a


303
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:44,016
resources folder at the top


304
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,306
level of the playground as well


305
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,336
as for each page.


306
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,946
You can use these resources that


307
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,176
you've added to your playground


308
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:53,226
both in your markup and code.


309
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,346
Similar to how you create a link


310
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,796
in your playground, you can use


311
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,276
this highlighted syntax to imbed


312
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:01,326
an image in your markup.


313
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,396
You specify the image name, in


314
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,466
this case MyPicture.jpg.


315
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:09,046
You also specify alternate text


316
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,796
describing the image along with


317
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,476
hover title text that shows my


318
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,056
pointer is over the image.


319
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,776
Both alternate text and hover


320
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,296
title text can also be used for


321
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,906
accessibility to benefit


322
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:20,756
voiceover users.


323
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,086
And here we access the same


324
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,146
imaging code using the standard


325
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,846
UIImage or NSImage APIs.


326
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,046
Similarly, to images you can


327
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,486
also imbed videos in your


328
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,016
markup.


329
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,626
This is done by using a syntax


330
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,546
similar for that images with


331
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:39,676
additional support for


332
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,926
specifying a poster image along


333
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:45,596
with the width and height of the


334
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,086
video.


335
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,676
For other resources that you


336
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,286
want to access in code, such as


337
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:51,686
this video, you can use the


338
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:53,756
standard Bundle APIs for finding


339
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:54,476
resources.


340
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,716
This example uses a URL for


341
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:59,926
resource with extension API to


342
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,046
ask the main bundle for URL for


343
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,546
Mvideo.mp4.


344
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,606
Resources in your playground are


345
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,176
automatically treated as


346
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,596
resources of the main bundle.


347
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:13,346
For more information on the


348
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:14,576
markup you can use in your


349
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:16,066
playgrounds and the playground


350
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,306
support framework we discussed


351
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,696
earlier, please visit


352
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:21,386
developer.apple.com.


353
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,196
With that please welcome my


354
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,726
teammate Alex Brown to the stage


355
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,196
so he can tell you more about


356
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:27,216
exciting new changes to


357
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,406
playgrounds in Xcode 10.


358
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:29,626
Thank you.


359
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:38,646
[ Applause ]


360
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:39,766
>> Thank you, Tibet.


361
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:42,886
I'm Alex Brown and I'm a Core OS


362
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:43,396
Engineer.


363
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,226
I want to ask you a question.


364
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,576
Have you ever woken up with a


365
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,916
great coding idea but then


366
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,556
struggled to set it down before


367
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:53,536
you reach your code editor?


368
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,026
Perhaps it's your inbox that


369
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,036
gets in the way or perhaps you


370
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,736
haven't yet set up your project


371
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:00,806
within Xcode.


372
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:03,766
Whether you're a beginner just


373
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,026
getting started with Apple APIs,


374
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,316
a seasoned engineer with a


375
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:10,986
deadline, or a data scientist


376
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,226
building machine learning


377
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:15,696
models, I want to tell you that


378
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,216
Xcode playgrounds are the


379
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,126
fastest way to get started


380
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,366
coding against Apple's APIs.


381
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:27,376
In Xcode 10, playgrounds are


382
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,956
faster and more responsive than


383
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,726
ever allowing you to execute


384
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:32,346
your code in a step-by-step


385
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:32,776
fashion.


386
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,376
First I'd like to get you


387
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:36,876
familiar with a new UI for doing


388
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:36,976
this.


389
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:42,586
If you're familiar with


390
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,406
playgrounds, your eye should


391
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:46,646
immediately jump to the blue


392
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:49,056
line over the not line numbers.


393
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,576
There's a new play button which


394
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:53,436
tracks your pointer.


395
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:57,296
A blue line over the line


396
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:59,706
numbers mean these lines are


397
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:02,286
ready to execute and when you


398
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,796
click the Play button this means


399
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:07,466
run all of the blue lines up to


400
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,076
and including the one with the


401
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:09,826
play button on it.


402
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,456
Let's see what that looks like.


403
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:13,606
There we go.


404
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,566
You can see just the first three


405
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:16,696
lines of the playground are


406
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,346
executed.


407
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,536
The results are visible on the


408
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:20,276
right-hand side.


409
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,726
You can also see that the play


410
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,226
button has now gone gray.


411
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,126
This indicates that these lines


412
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,656
of code are no longer ready to


413
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,116
execute.


414
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,396
You just executed them.


415
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,066
There's a second reason that


416
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,416
they play button might be gray.


417
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,486
This means you're hovering over


418
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:37,796
some code, which is not a


419
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:39,246
top-level line of code.


420
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:41,736
This includes code inside


421
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,636
function brackets and inside of


422
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,126
fall loop.


423
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,436
If you wish to execute a fall


424
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,966
loop you need to move your


425
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,056
pointer to the closing brace


426
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,236
where the play button will go


427
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,696
blue then you'll be able to


428
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,906
execute it.


429
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,366
There's also a great keyboard


430
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,656
shortcut, Shift Return.


431
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,476
This is just like pressing


432
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,806
Return at the end of typing a


433
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,736
line of code, but it also means


434
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,726
execute this line, and it move


435
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:10,966
the cursor to the next line


436
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:14,036
ready to write some more code.


437
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,956
Blue code also has a second


438
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,686
interpretation.


439
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,916
It means code that it's safe to


440
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:21,986
edit without resetting your


441
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,546
playground.


442
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:24,456
Why is this important?


443
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:26,916
If you edit code above the blue


444
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,736
line this is modifying code that


445
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,066
you've already executed.


446
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,706
So you'll have to resent your


447
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,556
playground to take account of


448
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,346
your changes.


449
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:37,636
When you edit code above the


450
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,956
blue line, the playground resets


451
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:40,756
automatically.


452
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,316
Sometimes you'll need to reset


453
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,786
your playground manually and you


454
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,526
can do this using the stop


455
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,376
button in the Debug bar at the


456
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:52,266
bottom of the screen.


457
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,586
So why run in a step-by-step


458
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:56,086
fashion?


459
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,326
Why have we added this feature?


460
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:00,226
Firstly, executing just one more


461
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:01,026
line is fast.


462
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:02,946
It's way faster than restarting


463
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,146
a playground and waiting for it


464
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,526
to catch up with your thoughts.


465
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,496
Secondly, it allows you to


466
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,886
respond to live data.


467
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,796
Write a line of code, execute


468
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,476
it, see what the results are,


469
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,596
and this should lead you


470
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,986
naturally to the next line of


471
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:17,606
code to write.


472
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,736
And thirdly rerunning a


473
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,486
playground every time can give


474
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,846
you different values every time.


475
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:25,836
This can happen, for instance,


476
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,186
if you're accessing a network


477
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,206
resource or you're generating


478
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,006
random numbers.


479
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,706
By executing step-by-step your


480
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:34,416
data model stays stable and


481
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,396
easier to understand.


482
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,406
So let's take a look at a simple


483
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,806
example that you can try


484
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,516
yourselves.


485
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:43,766
I like games.


486
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,486
I like card games and board


487
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,676
games and computer games.


488
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,786
I even like writing games.


489
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,016
Now I'm not too hot at it so I


490
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,286
like to keep my games small.


491
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,906
This is a really small game.


492
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:55,486
It's the game of roshambo.


493
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,736
It's the schoolyard game of


494
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:59,656
rock, paper, scissors.


495
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:01,856
I've written the rules as a


496
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,746
simple function check, which


497
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,766
tells us if we've won.


498
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:06,836
I've also written a computer


499
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,336
player, which simply makes one


500
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,516
of the moves at random.


501
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:13,246
By executing step-by-step we can


502
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,736
execute line six where the


503
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,786
computer player plays and see


504
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,256
what the result is before making


505
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:18,746
our move.


506
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,956
In this case the computer player


507
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,756
has played "rock" and we've


508
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:23,716
played "paper".


509
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:26,546
Paper beats rock and we win the


510
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:26,946
game.


511
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,316
This might sound a little bit


512
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:30,756
like cheating, but it's an


513
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,976
extremely powerful technique.


514
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,246
It's an extremely powerful


515
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,046
technique when you're trying to


516
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,056
learn a new and unfamiliar API


517
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,416
or exploring a data structure


518
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:44,996
whose types and values you don't


519
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:45,456
yet know.


520
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,116
So that's a very simple example.


521
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:49,506
Now we're going to look at


522
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,536
something a little bit more


523
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:51,646
magical with a demo.


524
00:16:54,516 --> 00:17:00,500
[ Applause ]


525
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,415
So we started off with one game,


526
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:07,796
I'm going to move on to another.


527
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,336
This is the game of Tic-tac-toe.


528
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:12,816
I've already been working on


529
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:13,556
this a little while.


530
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:16,185
I've built the game engine and


531
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,486
I've made a first version of the


532
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:17,685
UI.


533
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,856
I've moved all of that code


534
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,406
aside into the auxiliary


535
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,066
sources.


536
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:23,836
This gets it out of our way and


537
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,246
allows us to focus on the next


538
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:27,185
steps -- actually playing the


539
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,996
game and refining the UI a


540
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:29,356
little.


541
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:32,176
I'm also going to use a live


542
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,976
view, but first let's look back


543
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:36,366
at the blue control over the


544
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,106
line numbers.


545
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,876
You can see that it tracks the


546
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:39,556
mouse pointer.


547
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:43,696
So let's get started by loading


548
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,256
the game board.


549
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,626
Let's rotate it so we can see


550
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:48,436
it.


551
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,406
This is the Tic-tac-toe game


552
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:50,686
board.


553
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,356
You can see I've been able to


554
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,586
execute the first half of the


555
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,356
playground and I've still got


556
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:56,306
some lines left in the


557
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:57,356
playground to execute.


558
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,116
These include my first move.


559
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,566
Let's run that.


560
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:03,946
There we go.


561
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:05,576
So you can see we're going to be


562
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,266
playing the game in code and


563
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,666
viewing the results with the


564
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,306
live view.


565
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:12,706
Let's let the computer play and


566
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:13,686
have a turn.


567
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:18,956
Few, that's great.


568
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,406
The computer player is


569
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,306
completely random.


570
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,116
So it's just possible it's going


571
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:23,876
to beat me today.

[ Laughter ]


573
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,916
So I've shown you how we can


574
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,046
execute some of the lines of


575
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:33,066
code and then step-by-step


576
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,786
execute lines of code which are


577
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:35,546
already present in the


578
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:36,076
playground.


579
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:37,996
But we can do more than that.


580
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:39,706
It's always safe to add new code


581
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,706
at the end of a playground.


582
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:41,976
So let's make another move.


583
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:52,246
There we go.


584
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:54,626
Now, I can click the Play button


585
00:18:55,216 --> 00:19:00,026
to execute this line of code and


586
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:00,856
I think now we'll let the


587
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:01,746
computer have another go.


588
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:07,976
That's great.


589
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:12,626
[ Laughing ]


590
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,166
You should notice a couple of


591
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:14,676
things here.


592
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,686
Number one, in the beginning the


593
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:18,616
board was flat.


594
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,106
I had to rotate it so it was in


595
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,236
a position where we could view


596
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:21,436
it.


597
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:24,906
As we execute more lines of


598
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,846
code, it doesn't rotate back to


599
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:27,896
its original position.


600
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,846
This is pretty good because I


601
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,366
could write lines of code to


602
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,456
rotate it to the correct


603
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:33,976
position, but this would involve


604
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:34,506
something called [inaudible],


605
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,316
and I don't think I'm quite


606
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,866
ready to learn that yet.


607
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,086
The second reason it's good is


608
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:42,836
because if the computer player


609
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:45,196
was allowed to play again, every


610
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:47,456
time we executed new code it


611
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:48,846
would effectively get a do-over,


612
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,036
which would be a little unfair.


613
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,376
Let's finish this up.


614
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,656
I think I can take the game home


615
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:55,000
from here.


616
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,156
Is that the right move?


617
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:09,616
That's great.


618
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:16,886
[ Applause ]


619
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:18,376
You can see the game has


620
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,126
highlighted my winning move by


621
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,826
placing three red circles.


622
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,276
That's not too fancy.


623
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:25,356
I'm looking for something which


624
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,316
really makes it feel like a


625
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:27,066
celebration.


626
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,126
So I've been working on a new


627
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,146
version of the UI.


628
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,446
In a traditional development


629
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:33,806
environment, you would have to


630
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,426
set up a complex harness to


631
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,156
automatically play you deep into


632
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,446
the game or whatever the API was


633
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,186
you were using so that we could


634
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,556
test out something that happened


635
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,306
later on in the program.


636
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:46,636
But in a playground, because I'm


637
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,636
able to execute step-by-step, I


638
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:49,986
can play it manually to the end


639
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:51,356
of the game and then write new


640
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,916
lines of code to update


641
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,426
whatever's going on at that


642
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:54,696
point.


643
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:56,206
Let's do that now.


644
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,216
I've prepared a new effect for


645
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,176
the end of the game using a


646
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,046
particle system.


647
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,866
Let's use Shift Return to


648
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,546
execute it.


649
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:12,216
Boom. And that feels much more


650
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:12,806
like a win.


651
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:17,566
[ Applause ]


652
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,486
So let's review what we've just


653
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:19,706
seen.


654
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:22,956
By running step-by-step we can


655
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,956
explore an idea a line at a


656
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:25,446
time.


657
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:27,416
This enables us to have a


658
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,756
conversation between code and


659
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,146
data.


660
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,596
Every time we learn a new fact


661
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,536
we can write the next line of


662
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,416
code to explore it a little


663
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:36,736
more.


664
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,506
We can use Shift Return to keep


665
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,216
our hands on the keyboard and


666
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,306
our brains in the zone.


667
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:45,536
And finally, by adding a dynamic


668
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:47,376
live view to a playground, we


669
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,966
can create a second view of our


670
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,616
model and we can seamlessly


671
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,786
shift between manipulating it in


672
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,556
a graphical environment and


673
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:55,286
using code.


674
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,356
So whether you're a beginner,


675
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:02,436
just learning about new Apple


676
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:05,316

coding inspiration we invite you


681
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,536
to get started with a


682
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,186
playground.


683

Just in case you're still


684
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,536
looking for ideas I've got three


685
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,086
right here.


686
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,446
Number one if you're creating


687
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:31,696
your own API, one of the best


688
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:33,716
ways to showcase it is to create


689
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,976
a follow along tutorial for your


690
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:36,146
API.


691
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,956
Users can execute the code


692
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:40,006
step-by-step and see in real


693
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,586
time what it does.


694
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:45,566
Number two you can download and


695
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:47,176
explore some publicly available


696
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:48,976
data using the playground


697
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,016
step-by-step to drill down into


698
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:52,586
your data.


699
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:55,806
You could get this from maps,


700
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:57,586
from local government, or


701
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,326
perhaps a class project.


702
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:03,036
Finally, like I did, you could


703
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,976
create a game or an animation.


704
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:09,286
Start off simple using SpriteKit


705
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,476
or SyncKit and line by line


706
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,346
enhance it until it's completely


707
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:13,606
awesome.


708
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:18,106
So I hope we've shown you today


709
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,626
that playgrounds are not a toy.


710
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,156
They're fun but they're serious


711
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:23,466
fun.


712
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:28,296
They allow you to explore code


713
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,006
and data interactively.


714
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:31,766
This is great whether you've


715
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,356
downloaded an unknown snippet of


716
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:35,246
JSON using a rest API from the


717
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,176
Internet, or if you're dealing


718
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,576
with hundreds of thousands or


719
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:40,886
millions of lines of data for a


720
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,236
machine learning application.


721
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,026
And to find out more about that


722
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,486
use case I encourage you to


723
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:47,256
download and watch the Create ML


724

Secondly there's really no


727
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,236
better way to learn how to use


728
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,316
Apple APIs.


729
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:57,736
Whether you're just getting


730
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,946
started or your trying out a new


731
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:02,806
API, which you've learned about


732
00:24:03,436 --> 00:24:04,606
at this WWDC.


733
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:06,436
You don't just have to use


734
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:07,156
Apple's APIs.


735
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,546
You can also import your own


736
00:24:09,546 --> 00:24:11,016
frameworks into playgrounds.


737
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,436
And one of the best ways to


738
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,666
showcase this is to create


739
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,146
custom representations of your


740
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:18,546

framework that you ship will and


754
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:50,916

addition of a playground.


756
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,976
Playgrounds provide a richer

00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,616

768
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:22,906
custom representations of your


769
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:25,956
types in playgrounds so that


770
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,776
users can get a nice summary.


771
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:31,016
I'll follow that up with how to


772
00:25:31,016 --> 00:25:33,646
import your frameworks into


773
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:34,766
playgrounds.


774
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,476
And finally, I'll cover a little


775
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:38,746
bit of troubleshooting tips for


776
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,156
when things don't go exactly as


777
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:40,776
you'd expect.


778
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,426
Let's start with Playground


779
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:46,526
Display Convertible.


780
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,816
So as you know, when a user


781
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:54,256
types in a line of code values


782
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,726
show up on the right hand side


783
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:57,736
in the result sidebar.


784
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,256
For types that are no optimized


785
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:03,466
for playgrounds there are two


786
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,716
ways that playgrounds will


787
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:05,976
generate this description.


788
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,296
For types that do not conform to


789
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:12,236
Custom String Convertible, we


790
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:14,666
will create a structured


791
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,686
representation using the Swift


792
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:16,856
type.


793
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,436
For types that do conform to


794
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:20,746
Custom String Convertible, we


795
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,256
will use the result of calling


796
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:23,806
descriptions.


797
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:27,906
When this isn't enough sometimes


798
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:31,716
your users will tap on the Quick


799
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,236
Look button on the right-hand


800
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:33,576
side.


801
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:40,026
They will also tap or click on


802
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:42,646
the Inline Results button.


803
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:47,636
When they do this a custom


804
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,316
representation will show up.


805
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,556
Often a textual representation.


806
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,566
And for many types this is


807
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:56,106
perfectly enough but sometimes


808
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:58,896
maybe you would like to return a


809
00:26:58,896 --> 00:26:59,236
number.


810
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,336
This is still text though and


811
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:06,056
there are times when text isn't


812
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,066
going to be enough and you would


813
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,456
like to return something


814
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,446
graphical, maybe a picture.


815
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,656
The way to control what you


816
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:17,706
return is to implement Custom


817
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:19,226
Playground Display Convertible,


818
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,936
a new protocol introduced in


819
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:26,506
Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.


820
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:29,436
It replaces Custom Playground


821
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:31,046
Quick Lookable, which was


822
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:32,686
deprecated in the same versions.


823
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,756
Let's take a look at conformance


824
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:39,016
right now.


825
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:41,926
You can see here that conforming


826
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,356
involves only returning one


827
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:45,426
property, Playground


828
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:45,856
Description.


829
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:47,946
Playground Description is of


830
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:49,916
type Any, which means you can


831
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,456
return anything that you feel


832
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:54,686
best describes your value.


833
00:27:56,496 --> 00:27:58,256
Now, there are certain types


834
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,416
that have specialized


835
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:01,446
representations already and


836
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,296
those are provided by Apple.


837
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,856
Here's a list of the types with


838
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,716
specialized representations as


839
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:11,786
of Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.


840
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:14,676
The types on the left have a


841
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:15,936
particularly textual


842
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:16,766
representation.


843
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:19,456
The types on the right have a


844
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,646
graphical representation.


845
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,586
I invite you to try each of


846
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,686
these and decide which best


847
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:27,326
represents your value in a


848
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:27,926
playground.


849
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:32,486
Once you've done this you'll


850
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,196
want to ship all of your types,


851
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,636
and your values, and your API to


852
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:36,486
your users.


853
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:40,366
I'm going to show you how to


854
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:42,646
import your own custom


855
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,256
frameworks into playgrounds


856
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,026
alongside Apple frameworks.


857
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,616
Typically, when you build a


858
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:52,846
single framework in a project,


859
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,016
that framework will end up in


860
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,386
the Built Products Directory.


861
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,076
When you want to import it into


862
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,386
a playground, that is where the


863
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:04,146
playground will work.


864
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:05,436
The simplest way to make sure


865
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:06,376
that your playground will see


866
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,886
your framework is to add the


867
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:10,356
playground to your project.


868
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,936
This is the strategy that I


869
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:15,016
suggest for simple projects


870
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:16,316
where you have access the


871
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,836
project and are willing to edit


872
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:18,466
it.


873
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:19,766
This is what that would look


874
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:20,976
like in the Project Navigator.


875
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:26,956
Once you've added this project,


876
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,106
or once you've added this


877
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,466
playground to your project, I


878
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,076
have a little bit of advice.


879
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:34,036
Remember building is very much


880
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,666
like walking in that you have to


881
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,716
remember to build before you


882
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:39,506
run.


883
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:45,676
Now, sometimes you have more


884
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,576
than one project, more than one


885
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,526
framework, maybe you have two,


886
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:54,026
three, four, and in this case


887
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:55,596
that Built Products Directory


888
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,076
situation that I just described


889
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:58,656
is actually multiplied.


890
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,986
There are multiple Build Product


891
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:00,736
Directories if you have separate


892
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:00,976
projects.


893
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,636
This can be a problem when you


894
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,836
want to import your code into a


895
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:06,576
playground.


896
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,676
The simplest way to address this


897
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:11,006
is to add each project to a


898
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,656
workspace, a single workspace,


899
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,486
and then when you build each


900
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:19,166
project, those frameworks will


901
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:21,836
end up in that one Built


902
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,476
Products Directory for your


903
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,056
workspace.


904
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:26,656
After that just add the


905
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,696
playground to that workspace and


906
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:29,786
everything should be fine.


907
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:32,746
This is what that should look


908
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,096
like in the project navigator.


909
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:39,506
Now, let's say you've done this,


910
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,026
you followed my instructions and


911
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,026
things don't work out how you


912
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:43,476
expect.


913
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,226
You say, "TJ lied to me."


914
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,876
You're going to want to check


915
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,176
the Built Products Directory to


916
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:52,556
make sure that everything ends


917
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,026
up there as you expect.


918
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,386
Here's how you can do that.


919
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,266
You're going to go to File,


920
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:05,666
Project Settings, and then we're


921
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,966
going to click the Advanced


922
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:09,866
button.


923
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:12,006
On this screen in light gray


924
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,356
we'll see that there is a


925
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:16,986
Products destination.


926
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:19,086
You'll click on that and that


927
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,516
should bring you directly to the


928
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:22,456
Built Products Director for the


929
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:23,966
project that you have open.


930
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:28,006
This is what that should look


931
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:28,856
like in Finder.


932
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,126
Now let's see all of this


933
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:33,796
brought together in a demo.


934
00:31:35,516 --> 00:31:40,500
[ Applause ]


935
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:45,576
Now those of you who know me


936
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,986
know that I have a pretty


937
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,236
enduring interest in music.


938
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,136
I'm actually so interested in


939
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:55,926
music that I have found this new


940
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:57,646
notation, well new to me


941
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,336
notation, called Helmholtz


942
00:31:59,336 --> 00:31:59,806
notation.


943
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,916
And I feel that many, many


944
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,036
people should know about this


945
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:03,826
and it should be much more


946
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:04,516
widely used.


947
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:06,836
So I've created a framework to


948
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,376
share with other developers so


949
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:09,296
that they can use it in their


950
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:09,636
code.


951
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,446
You can see here that I've


952
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,796
included a playground and I've


953
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:17,886
also, as the result of extensive


954
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:20,366
research on Wikipedia written up


955
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,846
a little playground that


956
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:23,946
describes the notation.


957
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,746
Follow it, followed by a few


958
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:28,376
values so that we can see the


959
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:30,746
results on the right hand side


960
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,486
with the notation.


961
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:36,946
If I render this documentation


962
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:41,476
this will all end up in Pros


963
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:43,136
with the links highlighted in


964
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:45,116
blue just as Tibet spoke of.


965
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:51,026
And before I build, or before I


966
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:55,126
run I'm going to build.


967
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,716
Then let's run our playground,


968
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:00,276
yay.


969
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:05,546
[ Applause ]


970
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:07,246
You can see here that on the


971
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,506
right-hand side in the results I


972
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:09,906
have this interesting notation.


973
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:11,386
I really think that this


974
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:14,376
notation is interesting because


975
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:15,906
the lower pitches are


976
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,296
represented by uppercase


977
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:17,736
letters.


978
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,196
The higher pitches are


979
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,776
represented by lowercase letters


980
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:22,746
and the exact octave is


981
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:24,526
indicated by either commas or


982
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:27,566
apostrophes, the count thereof.


983
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:31,036
Now, hopefully you all get this


984
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,826
looking at this notation, and


985
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,046
hopefully I've explained it very


986
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,466
well, but I've actually had some


987
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,266
trouble with some of the people


988
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:37,906
I'm tutoring.


989
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:40,246
They're not taking to it as well


990
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:40,766
as I'd like.


991
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,906
So I actually have a separate


992
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:44,746
framework that I've created with


993
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:46,356
a keyboard visualization that I


994
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:49,106
think will really help them ease


995
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:50,056
into this notation.


996
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:53,046
Since I want to use that, I'm


997
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:53,906
actually going to create a


998
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,316
separate playground in a


999
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,796
workspace where I can import


1000
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,996
both frameworks without changing


1001
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,056
either of the frameworks.


1002
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:03,566
So to do that I'm going to


1003
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:07,776
quickly close this, I'm going to


1004
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:13,806
create a brand new workspace by


1005
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:18,505
going to File, New Work Space,


1006
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:22,206
and I'm going to name this


1007
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:22,686
Tutoring.


1008
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,815
Just put that on the desktop.


1009
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,735
Then I'm going to add each


1010
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:35,815
framework by going to File, Add


1011
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:36,326
Files.


1012
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:39,306
I'm going to start with


1013
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:41,996
Helmholtz, my framework that I


1014
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,565
just had open, then File, right


1015
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,505
there, Keyboard.


1016
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,315
Then I'm going to add a new


1017
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:56,065
playground by going to File,


1018
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,176
New, Playground.


1019
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:04,196
A blank playground is fine.


1020
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,196
My Playground is a fine name, a


1021
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,046
fine as name as any.


1022
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:12,936
I'm going to start by importing


1023
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:17,736
Helmholtz, and My Keyboard.


1024
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:25,676
After that I'm just going to


1025
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:28,376
quickly do a little test to make


1026
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,376
sure that pitches show up as I


1027
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:31,776
expect.


1028
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:35,426
I'm going to build each of my


1029
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,166
frameworks.


1030
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,586
I'm going to make sure to choose


1031
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:39,976
each one from the schemes.


1032
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:41,816
Later on I might want to make a


1033
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,316
separate scheme that builds both


1034
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:45,256
of these projects in one go, but


1035
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,876
I don't have time on stage right


1036
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:47,126
now.


1037
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,696
And then I'm going to run My


1038
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:52,476
Playground in it.


1039
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:53,766
Everything works as expected.


1040
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:57,186
But again this visualization is


1041
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:57,786
not helping.


1042
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,016
I have some younger students who


1043
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:01,306
have only seen a piano, so I


1044
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,206
have a little snippet here that


1045
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:08,906
quickly creates a view in


1046
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:09,876
playground description,


1047
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:12,116
configures it, and actually I


1048
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:13,656
have one more line that I wanted


1049
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:14,526
to write on stage.


1050
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:19,336
Custom text equals description.


1051
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:22,476
And after I configure my view


1052
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:24,166
I'm going to return it.


1053
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:25,076
Simple as that.


1054
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,086
Made much simpler by the fact


1055
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:27,966
that I happen to have a


1056
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:29,336
framework already on hand.


1057
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,826
Now, I want to run this line,


1058
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:34,426
line 4 again, but with my


1059
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,036
conformant.


1060
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,736
So I'm going to reset this


1061
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:38,406
playground by clicking on the


1062
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,976
stop button down here.


1063
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:45,976
And then I'm going to rerun this


1064
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:49,516
entire playground after I add my


1065
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:49,976
inline result.


1066
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,056
And you can see here --

[ Applause ]


1068
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:03,816
You can see here that I have a


1069
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:05,846
nice visualization of a keyboard


1070
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,806
that my students can recognize


1071
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:10,826
along with the notation that I'm


1072
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:11,566
trying to teach.


1073
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,976
Now let's cover or let's go back


1074
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,976
over what we've learned today.


1075
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,606
Tibet covered the fundamentals


1076
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:30,436
of playgrounds, the layout and


1077
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,376
playground markup syntax.


1078
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,016
Alex explained the power of


1079
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,846
running step-by-step in


1080
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:37,466
playgrounds.


1081
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:39,306
And I covered Custom Playground


1082
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:41,266
Display Convertible and


1083
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:42,686
importing your own code.


1084
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:46,116
So hopefully, now that I've


1085
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:47,996
given this session and all of us


1086
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:49,696
have -- and we've explained


1087
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,686
playgrounds and the power that


1088
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,526
you can get, we hope to see that


1089
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,656
every project has a playground


1090
00:37:58,806 --> 00:37:59,346
next year.


1091
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:04,966
If you have any questions please


1092
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,226
feel free to visit us in the


1093
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:07,676
labs and we'll see you next


1094
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:07,976
