00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:07,566
>> Hello everyone.


3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,216
My name is Shiva Sundar, and I'm


4
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,526
extremely excited to talk about


5
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,696
HEVC Video with Alpha.


6
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:19,116
You're probably familiar with


7
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:21,216
Alpha channels in image files today.


8
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,716
Alpha channels are ubiquitous


9
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,776
in image files, in our apps and on


10
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:28,136
the web.


11
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,806
When there's an Alpha channel


12
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:33,726
in an image file, every pixel in the


13
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:36,236
image gets opacity along with


14
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:36,816
its color.


15
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:40,706
This allows us to have an image


16
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,256
that has a complex,


17
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:44,916
non-rectangular shape but looks


18
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,786
natural when composited against


19
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,066
many different backgrounds.


20
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:55,536
So Alpha and transparency are


21
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:58,336
common and used all over the web


22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,816
principally by still image


23
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:01,946
formats like PNG.


24
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,216
Alpha in video has been less


25
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:07,626
common.


26
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:11,296
It has been a professional video


27
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,456
workflow tool.


28
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,466
The formats used in professional


29
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,576
video workflows like Apple


30
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:20,516
ProRes 4444 are very high data


31
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:22,286
rate and not appropriate for


32
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:22,726
delivery.


33
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:26,776
In 2017, Apple introduced


34
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,906
support for the HEIF image file


35
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:31,286
format, which lets us take


36
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:33,816
advantage of the advanced


37
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:34,476
Loose compression


38
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,526
technologies in HEVC to compress


39
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,466
still images.


40
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,016
HEIF also lets you include an


41
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:43,946
Alpha channel in image files.


42
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,216
In fact, this year we are


43
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,286
adding support for HEIF


44
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,816
sequences, which lets you have


45
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,536
multiple images in a single


46
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:53,916
file.


47
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,536
HEIF sequences also support


48
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,336
Alpha channels.


49
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,136
For some time we've recognized


50
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,796
the need for a lower bitrate way


51
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,696
to include Alpha in motion


52
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:07,076
video.


53
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:11,236
And so we said let's use that


54
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,656
advanced loosy compression


55
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,796
technology to support Alpha


56
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:16,876
channels in video files as well.


57
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:21,786
Playback of HEVC video with


58
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,616
Alpha is supported in iOS 13,


59
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:28,376
tvOS 13 and macOS Catalina on


60
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:29,976
all supported devices and


61
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:30,676
computers.


62
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:34,566
Encoding is supported on all of


63
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,446
those devices and computers that


64
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:37,836
have an HEVC encoder.


65
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,916
Having a video with Alpha format


66
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:45,286
that works well at bit rates low


67
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,696
enough for distribution opens up


68
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:48,796
many opportunities.


69
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,046
You can have rich,


70
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,896
non-rectangular motion video


71
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,246
content that you incorporate as


72
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,346
a layer as part of your app's


73
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,716
expressive experience.


74
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,136
It could be pre-rendered like an


75
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:04,856
animation.


76
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,926
Such an element can move around


77
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,446
on top of a complicated


78
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:11,476
background and you could even have


79
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,276
several of them to give a


80
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,366
feeling of depth or complex


81
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,116
interactions.


82
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,416
Because these are movies they


83
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,746
can have synchronized sound


84
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,046
tracks so the characters in


85
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,916
these non-rectangular movies can


86
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:25,296
talk.


87
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:27,346
>> Highly professional.


88
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:28,476
>> Alpha channel.


89
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:29,176
>> Content.


90
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:29,896
>> For you.


91
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,336
>> Woo-hoo.


92
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,196
>> Woo-hoo.


93
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,826
>> They could be integrated into


94
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,866
games using SpriteKit, SceneKit


95
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:38,646
or Metal.


96
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,356
In this context, we have


97
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:42,696
provided you with some sample


98
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:45,376
code on how to record a SceneKit


99
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:48,266
scene into a HEVC video with


100
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,706
Alpha and how to render another


101
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,036
in a SpriteKit scene.


102
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,336
On web pages, they could bring


103
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,926
interactive elements to life.


104
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,926
HEVC video with Alpha is


105
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:03,806
supported by Safari in iOS 13


106
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:05,606
and macOS Catalina.


107
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,826
Safari can also tell the web


108
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,666
page whether this feature is


109
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,206
supported.


110
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,016
For more information on using


111
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:17,956
the media capabilities API, be


112
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,236
sure to check out the What's New


113
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:22,696
in Authentication, Safari and


114
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,746
WebKit video.


115
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:29,236
The ability to distribute video


116
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,166
with Alpha at low bitrates opens


117
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,026
opportunities for authoring apps


118
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,726
to provide background removal.


119
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,206
Here I am in front of a green


120
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:42,006
sheet hung from the wall


121
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,826
recorded using an iPhone.


122
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:53,366
I wish I was here.


123
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:55,936
I used a custom video compositor


124
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,356
with a co-image filter to


125
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,096
replace the green pixels with


126
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,786
transparency and exported it to


127
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:03,856
a video with Alpha.


128
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,096
I wish I was here.


129
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,756
And now I can overlay this video


130
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,186
on any background I like.


131
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,606
I wish I was here.


132
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,536
We are providing sample code


133
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,066
showing how to do this and write


134
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,366
the resulting HEVC video with


135
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,156
Alpha movie.


136
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:36,656
So how does this work?


137
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:40,446
As you know, movie files contain


138
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,556
tracks of various media types.


139
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,766
A video track contains video


140
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,196
frames.


141
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,716
HEVC video with Alpha is


142
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,876
contained inside a single video


143
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,036
track in the movie.


144
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,486
In the single track, each frame


145
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,526
contains 2 parts called layers


146
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,326
and each layer is compressed


147
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:04,896
using the HEVC codec.


148
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,876
The base layer contains the


149
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,666
colored image of the frame as


150
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,066
usual.


151
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,716
The Alpha layer contains just


152
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,266
the Alpha channel of the frame.


153
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,076
This is done using special HEVC


154
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,286
syntax which identifies the 2


155
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:22,836
layers.


156
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,506
The HEVC rules for this syntax


157
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,326
mean that the HEVC decoder that


158
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,276
does not know how to handle the


159
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:33,956
Alpha layer will ignore it and


160
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,336
display the base layer alone.


161
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,826
Let's move along and talk about


162
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:40,696
how to use it.


163
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,456
HEVC with Alpha encoding is


164
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,926
integrated into numerous AV


165
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:48,236
Foundation APIs.


166
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,786
Let's look at content creation,


167
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,516
for example.


168
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,026
You can render video frames with


169
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,706
Alpha in your application and


170
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:00,506
use AVAssetWriter to encode them


171
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,326
and write them to a movie file.


172
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,516
You can use new presets


173
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,516
available with


174
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,896
AVAssetExportSession to


175
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,926
transcode video formats


176
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,716
containing Alpha including Apple


177
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,966
ProRes 4444 into HEVC with


178
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,406
Alpha.


179
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,206
These new HEVC presets have the


180
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,946
suffix with Alpha.


181
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,786
You can also use


182
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:30,786
AVAssettExportSession to burn


183
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,886
in a specific background color


184
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,606
converting a movie with Alpha


185
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:38,556
into a movie without Alpha, that


186
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:40,406
will play on players that don't


187
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,026
support HEVC with Alpha.


188
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:48,586
Or you can also use the HEVC


189
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,376
with Alpha video encoder


190
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,996
directly via


191
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,256
VTCompressionSession.


192
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:58,866
Looking at AVFoundation's


193
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,706
playback APIs, HEVC with Alpha


194
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:05,556
is supported by AVPlayer and


195
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,996
AVPlayerLayer for display in


196
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:10,056
your apps view hierarchy via


197
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,016
Core Animation, AppKit and UIKit.


198
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,606
The video in AVPlayerLayer will


199
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,506
be displayed with a transparent


200
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,686
background and composed with the


201
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,206
rest of the layers and views.


202
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,766
Alternatively you can access a


203
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,916
sequence of decoded video frames


204
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:32,856
directly using 


205
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:33,846
AVPlayerItemVideoOutput.


206
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,856
This is a great choice when you


207
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,616
want to incorporate those video


208
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,846
frames into a custom rendering


209
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,546
you're doing using Metal,


210
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,046
SpriteKit and other GPU-based


211
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:49,176
rendering APIs.


212
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:51,246
If you need to decode frames for


213
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:54,746
another purpose, you can use


214
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,266
AVAssetImageGenerator directory


215
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,436
and individual frame of the


216
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:02,156
movie as a CGImage with Alpha.


217
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:06,236
You can use AVAssetReader to


218
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:09,186
extract video frames for use in


219
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,496
a non-playback workflow.


220
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,856
You can also use the HEVC with


221
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,886
Alpha video decoder directly via


222
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:20,416
VTDecompressionSession.


223
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:25,776
In short because HEVC with Alpha


224
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,746
is integrated into AVFoundation


225
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,196
at the level of a video codec,


226
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,796
it fits in well into all these


227
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,486
familiar API workflows.


228
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,536
Now let us see how we can


229
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,106
accomplish this in code.


230
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,846
When encoding a movie, when


231
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,216
configuring your AVAssetWriter


232
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,776
input or VTCompressionSession,


233
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:55,036
use the video codec type HEVC


234
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:55,716
with Alpha.


235
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:59,236
This is a special signal that


236
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,586
the Alpha channel should be


237
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:01,106
encoded.


238
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,336
The encoded file will have the


239
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,466
standard HEVC codec type.


240
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,056
It will be backwards compatible.


241
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,216
An HEVC player that does not


242
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,286
understand Alpha will display


243
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:15,756
only the base video layer.


244
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:17,526
It will ignore the Alpha


245
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:17,996
portion.


246
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:21,306
If you work with Alpha channels,


247
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,606
you may know that there are 2


248
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,576
strategies for how to write


249
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,086
video data to a file,


250
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,636
premultiplied Alpha or straight


251
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,206
Alpha, also known as


252
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:33,956
unassociated Alpha or


253
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,346
non-premultiplied Alpha.


254
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,186
The tradeoffs between these


255
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,316
choices are beyond the scope of


256
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:40,996
this talk.


257
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,086
If you're familiar with these,


258
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:46,506
what you need to know is that


259
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,416
both are supported.


260
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,716
If you're not similar with


261
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,996
these, we recommend the default,


262
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,896
which is premultiplied Alpha.


263
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,856
It's the natural choice in most


264
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,906
GPU-based rendering parts and it


265
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:00,736
scales better.


266
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,036
Now looking at the code, you may


267
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,606
specify the Alpha mode by either


268
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,286
configuring the compression


269
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,676
session or as a buffer


270
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:12,306
attachment.


271
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,606
As a safety mechanism if the


272
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,206
setting and the buffer


273
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,256
attachment are both specified


274
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,246
and they do not match, the


275
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,036
encoding operation will fail.


276
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,996
Our APIs require the


277
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,556
Alpha channel to be encoded with


278
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,006
fixed quality because video


279
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,176
encoding artifacts in the Alpha


280
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,126
channel can be bothersome in


281
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,986
ways that the same artifacts


282
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,636
wouldn't be in the base layer.


283
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:41,486
Our APIs let you


284
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,136
control the base layers bitrate


285
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:46,026
and the Alpha channel's quality


286
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:49,876
separately if you need to.


287
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,426
Now, looking at the code you can


288
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:54,396
specify the Alpha layer quality


289
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,876
using target quality for Alpha


290
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:57,546
parameter.


291
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,876
It is arranged between 0 and 1


292
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:04,026
where 1 means it is close to


293
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:04,596
lossless.


294
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,036
The bitrate parameter you


295
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:09,316
specify only applies to the base


296
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,126
layer and is ignored by the


297
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:11,846
Alpha layer.


298
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,306
To detect the presence of an


299
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:18,076
Alpha channel, you can either


300
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,556
test AV media characteristic


301
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:24,076
containsAlphaChannel or you


302
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,506
can query the format description


303
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,196
extension contains Alpha


304
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:28,496
channel.


305
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,286
If you are trying to export HEVC


306
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,376
with Alpha movie, use to


307
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,876
determine compatibility API to


308
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,026
validate that Alpha is present


309
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:40,886
in the source asset.


310
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,636
This validation only takes the


311
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:47,466
source movie into account not


312
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,546
the video composition.


313
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,046
So you must skip it if you are


314
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,126
using a video composition to


315
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,756
generate a new Alpha channel


316
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,766
from sources that do not have


317
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:57,476
Alpha channels.


318
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,386
There are a lot of video players


319
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,426
in the ecosystem.


320
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,216
Many of them don't support HEVC


321
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,586
let alone HEVC with Alpha.


322
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,716
You can remove the Alpha channel


323
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,426
by burning in a solid background


324
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:14,896
color.


325
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,616
We have added some convenience


326
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,906
API and sample code to help


327
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,196
simplify this conversion.


328
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,156
If you're looking to build


329
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:26,766
support into a non-Apple media


330
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,806
framework, we have published a


331
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:30,616
specification for an


332
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,506
interoperability profile that


333
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,476
you should read, but if you


334
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:36,316
can't wait, here is a sneak


335
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,000
peek.


336
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,756
To summarize, HEVC video with


337
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,676
Alpha is a cool new feature.


338
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,596
It takes advantage of HEVC's


339
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,716
state of the art compression


340
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:53,316
technology.


341
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:57,866
It is supported on iOS 13, tvOS


342
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,916
13 and macOS Catalina.


343
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,416
It takes advantage of hardware


344
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,496
acceleration on recent devices.


345
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:09,206
It is well integrated into


346
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,436
AVFoundation for use in your apps.


347
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,206
It is also integrated in Safari


348
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,166
for use in your web experiences.


349
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,526
HEVC with Alpha brings us new


350
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,276
opportunities for creative


351
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,286
expression for both developers


352
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:26,216
and users alike.


353
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,616
We can't wait to see the ways


354
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:30,376
you can take advantage of it in


355
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:30,766
your apps.


356
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,976
Thank you for your time.
