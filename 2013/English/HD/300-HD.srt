00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,766
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,486
>> Todd Fernandez: Good morning,
and welcome Session 300,


3
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:13,556
Managing Apple Devices.


4
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,616
I'm Todd Fernandez and
I'm very happy to be here


5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,066
with you this morning
representing not only my own


6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,476
engineering teams, but
a number of other teams


7
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,366
from across the company
who had been hard


8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,556
at work making some
exciting changes


9
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,266
in how Apple devices
can be managed


10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,226
in education and enterprise.


11
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,206
Look out, I just
said the E word.


12
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,896
In days of yore, device
management was based


13
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:39,316
on the desktop PC model.


14
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,356
IT departments would receive
a shipment of computers,


15
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,656
they'd erase them, install
a corporate custom image


16
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,796
containing whatever software
and policies and settings


17
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,976
that they felt were appropriate.


18
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:54,326
They distribute those computers
out to their end users.


19
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,036
Periodically, IT
may update them.


20
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,736
This model worked reasonably
well for a long time,


21
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,426
but times have changed
and we here


22
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,236
at Apple will modestly
take most of the credit.


23
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:09,306
Customers now have much
higher expectations.


24
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,636
They're no longer
satisfied with the static


25
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,156
and monolithic system imaging
methodologies of the past.


26
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,136
They now expect from their
device management tools


27
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,126
that they are dynamic
and on demand


28
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:21,296
and provide over-the-air
device management capabilities.


29
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,426
In short, devices
are now mobile.


30
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:29,156
iOS and the App Store introduced
the new model for deployment


31
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,696
and management and we want
to complete that transition


32
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:32,936
for all Apple devices.


33
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,416
People are now buying their
own devices and wanting


34
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,496
to bring them and use
them at school and work.


35
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,486
They're very comfortable
installing their own apps


36
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,376
and configuring those
devices to access resources


37
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:46,526
and information whether
they're on the road,


38
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,106
in the office, at
school or at home.


39
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,396
This has presented IT
departments with the challenge


40
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,886
of supporting this multitude


41
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:57,256
of deployment models while
still providing easy setup,


42
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:00,636
enforcing security policies
and distributing apps


43
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:02,376
and other content out
to their end users.


44
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:07,346
Our goal is to enable those
organizations to manage all


45
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:10,645
of their Apple devices in the
same ways with the same tools.


46
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,686
We've been working towards
this goal for some time


47
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:15,376
and we're taking
a big step forward


48
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,896
with some powerful new device
management capabilities


49
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:21,676
that we've built in to both
iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.


50
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,806
People love how easy it is to
set up their new Mac, or iPad


51
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,366
or iPhone or iPod Touch.


52
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,136
Within minutes, they are
connected to the internet,


53
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,296
installing apps and
communicating


54
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,356
with their friends and family.


55
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,636
And now, the same experience
is available to businesses


56
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:44,156
and schools to simplify
setup and management


57
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,016
of large numbers
of Apple devices.


58
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,436
We've greatly enhanced
app and book management,


59
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,596
dramatically simplified
device enrollment interval,


60
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,876
remote device management systems
and made a ton of enhancements


61
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:01,036
and added new capabilities
that enable organizations


62
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,026
to get more control over their
devices while still preserving


63
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,966
the great experience that users
have come to expect from Apple.


64
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:13,876
So our agenda today, we'll begin
by covering the large number


65
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,126
of small to medium size
changes that we've made


66
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,106
to the MDM protocol and
configuration profiles


67
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,026
in both iOS and OS
X and I'll point


68
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,366
out the remaining OS
specific differences as we go.


69
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,096
Now that work taken together
alone would be a huge advance,


70
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,286
but we didn't stop there.


71
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,946
We've also made big changes


72
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,746
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program


73
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,986
and we're introducing
a new service


74
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:39,076
that makes it much easier
to get devices enrolled


75
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,466
in the MDM server solution that
the organization is deploying.


76
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:46,556
Now, this session is primarily
targeted at developers


77
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,376
that are creating MDM and other
device management solutions.


78
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:53,486
Because we've done a lot of
work already, but we really rely


79
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,646
on you just as with the 1500


80
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,546
and more APIs we've
introduced this week


81
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,796
to fully take advantage of these
new capabilities we're offering


82
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,786
to you to make the experience


83
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,616
of our joint customers
much greater.


84
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,246
But of course it will
also be of interest


85
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,646
to anyone who's managing large
numbers of Apple devices as well


86
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:13,046
as app developers who want
to make their app attractive


87
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,926
to education and enterprise
customers who are buying


88
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:17,935
and deploying large
numbers of Apple devices


89
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,966
and may very well be interested
in buying large numbers


90
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,256
of copies of your apps.


91
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,146
Now, I'm no marketing executive,
but I think that might be


92
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,646
of interest to some of you.


93
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,316
So let's get started.


94
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,236
Before we get into what's new,


95
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,866
I wanted to just
give a brief recap


96
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,876
about the foundational tools
that Apple provides to those


97
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,256
of you who are building
device management tools


98
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,406
for the Apple ecosystem.


99
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,616
The first of which is our MDM
protocol which you can implement


100
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,376
to be able to over the air
communicate with Apple devices


101
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:54,376
and get information about that
device, be able to remotely lock


102
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:57,716
or wipe the device if it's
lost, to be able to install apps


103
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,976
over the air, as well


104
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,806
as installing configuration
profiles.


105
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:05,036
Now, configuration profiles were
the second foundational tool.


106
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,146
And they are collections
of settings


107
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:11,646
that can configure things on a
device such as accounts, mail,


108
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,186
context, calendars and so
on, in post restrictions


109
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:18,586
such as disabling the camera
if this device will be used


110
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,916
in a particularly sensitive
location, to provide access


111
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,126
to services like
networking and printers,


112
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:28,366
as well as to actually complete
MDM enrollment and establish


113
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,156
that connection back
to the MDM server.


114
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,226
Now, for those of you who
may not have actually solved


115
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,136
that problem of getting devices
enrolled in your MDM solution,


116
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,276
you may be thinking, "Well,


117
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,776
Todd isn't that a
chicken and egg problem?


118
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,526
You've got the MDM protocol
that you need to be established


119
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,046
to deliver the configuration
profile


120
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:44,566
which establishes
the MDM protocol?"


121
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,206
But in fact, we'll
leave that egg


122
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,306
to hatch later in the session.


123
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:52,016
So, just to give
you a quick scope


124
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:56,026
of what change we've introduced
in these new OS releases,


125
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,936
I'm only going to
highlight a few of these


126
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,086
and talk about them in detail.


127
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,736
But this is a huge amount of
work and we're looking forward


128
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,386
to you integrating
these new capabilities


129
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,756
into your device
management solutions.


130
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:12,876
And I'm going to talk in some
detail about five of them.


131
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:16,776
The first four are
primarily of interest


132
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,196
to enterprise deployments.


133
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,626
But I think the fifth one will
be compelling for both education


134
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,656
and enterprise customers
that are installing Apple TVs


135
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,726
in their conference
and classrooms.


136
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,406
But before I get
into the details,


137
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:32,546
I want to spend the moment
talking about a problem


138
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,436
that the mobile device
industry is facing.


139
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:39,656
And that is how to keep separate
the user's personal private data


140
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:43,846
and the company's secure data.


141
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,166
Now, some in the industry
seemed to have concluded


142
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,806
that the answer is
dual personas.


143
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,246
That the user should have


144
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,346
to decide whether
they're using their device


145
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,676
as their personal device with
access to their own private data


146
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,476
or they're using it as their
company's device with access


147
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,546
to the corporate secure data.


148
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,496
We don't think this
is the right approach.


149
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,496
We think that place is the
burden on the employee to make


150
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,476
that decision and
that's not how you--


151
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,166
people are using their devices.


152
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:15,506
We think the solution
needs to separate the data


153
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,736
without creating
separate workspaces.


154
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,436
And so, the features I'm going
to talk about now are part


155
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,236
of that solution and are focused


156
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,996
on keeping the user's personal
data protected and private


157
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,806
and the corporate data
protected and secure.


158
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:38,106
So the first feature I want to
talk about is very much in part


159
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,556
of that solution and
it's Manage Apps on iOS.


160
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,256
Now, this is not a
new feature in iOS 7.


161
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:47,326
What you can do previously
is install apps via MDM


162
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:51,036
on an iOS device and because the
organization has installed those


163
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,436
apps on that device, they
have additional rights


164
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:56,136
over those devices--
over those apps


165
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,446
and can therefore have
more control over the data


166
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,556
to prevent their secure
data leaking out in ways


167
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,506
that they don't want including
being able to delete that app


168
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,856
and its data and
prevent that apps data


169
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,176
from being backed up to iCloud.


170
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:13,146
In iOS 7, writing a number
of new capabilities including


171
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:16,056
on supervise devices, and
that little guy there is going


172
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,126
to indicate that
particular setting


173
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,006
or capability is only available
on supervised iOS devices


174
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:24,016
through out this session,
that apps can be installed


175
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,426
without user interaction on
supervised devices [applause].


176
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,416
I'm glad you like that
but there's way more.


177
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:37,366
And it's also possible
to configure device--


178
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,296
configure apps over the
air to provide the defaults


179
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,086
to change their behavior
once they're installed


180
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:42,846
on the device [applause].


181
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,256
I agree, it's really cool.


182
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:51,016
But we also have
the opposite of that


183
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:54,366
where using the MDM protocol,
you can then pull data back


184
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,126
from the app that has been
stored in the App Sandbox back


185
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416
to the MDM server to provide
to the organization [applause].


186
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,236
And then finally, this one
again is a big part of how--


187
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,666
of keeping that data separate
is Managed Open In [applause].


188
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,386
Apparently, you all
know what that means.


189
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,996
What that means is that the
organization can have greater


190
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,366
control over how their
users open documents


191
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,976
in Managed Apps and Accounts.


192
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,786
They can restrict the
list of apps that appear


193
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,956
in the Share Sheet thereby
keeping better control


194
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,896
over that data and again,
preventing it from leaking


195
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,066
out in ways that
they don't want.


196
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:39,346
The next feature I want to talk
about is called Single Sign On,


197
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,056
and this is really
building on some


198
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,746
of the concepts we introduced
in iOS 6 with the integration


199
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,196
of the Twitter and Facebook
credentials that are--


200
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,576
can be used in multiple apps.


201
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,136
We've now generalized
that to be able to be used


202
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:53,336
across the system where a set
of credentials can be stored


203
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,666
in one place provided
by configuration profile


204
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,696
and then used by multiple
apps for authentication.


205
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:02,726
This, we think, will be
great for app developers


206
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,206
to help them solve the
authentication problem


207
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,596
and help get their apps
adopted more wildly.


208
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,466
It takes the form
of a new payload


209
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,326
that provides the credentials,
as well as optionally a set


210
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,386
of URL prefixes where, if a
user goes to one of those URLs,


211
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:19,646
those credentials can be
used for authentication,


212
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,836
or in addition, they
can also provide a list


213
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,436
of app identifiers that are
for apps that are allowed


214
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,286
to use these credentials
for authentication.


215
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:31,906
Next, we move on to
one of the features


216
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,446
that Craig briefly
mentioned yesterday


217
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:36,046
and there's one brief shoutout
of excitement about that,


218
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,036
hopefully more of you are
excited about Per-App VPN


219
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,716
because this is another big
piece of the puzzle of how


220
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:42,506
to solve that data
separation problem.


221
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:47,296
Per-App VPN allows organizations
to more narrowly focus


222
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,906
which apps are going to use the
secure and private network back


223
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,236
to their remote services
at their company.


224
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,696
What this means is that instead


225
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,826
of having the VPN
cover the entire system


226
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:00,216
and have all data go
through that private network,


227
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,416
only the corporate
secure data will go


228
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,526
through the secure network, the
users private data does not.


229
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,086
So, this is better for both the
organization and the end user.


230
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,656
And there's one additional
detail for those of you


231
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:15,396
who are going to be implementing
this is that on iOS,


232
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:17,466
the Managed App needs
to be configured


233
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,496
to use Per-App VPN
when it's installed.


234
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,216
If you didn't notice one
more detail about that,


235
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,386
since it didn't have the iOS
badge up there when they cleared


236
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,436
that Per-App VPN, is
available on both OS X and iOS.


237
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,176
Now, moving on to an
OS X specific feature,


238
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,206
FileVault of course is not new


239
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,246
and even managing
FileVault is not new,


240
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,626
but we've added a great
number of new capabilities


241
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:44,436
that you can now manage
remotely for OS X systems


242
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,566
that are using FileVault,
including querying the status


243
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,716
of whether FileVault is enabled,
as well as preventing users


244
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,736
from disabling FileVault
once it's been enabled.


245
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:58,456
During the process of
enabling FileVault,


246
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,216
an individual recovery
key is generated


247
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,306
and provided to the user.


248
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,556
Instead of that being
sent to Apple for help--


249
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:08,096
the AppleCare, organizations
can now configure the device


250
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:11,286
so that key is sent back to the
company instead of to Apple.


251
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,486
They can also add
whatever period of--


252
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,246
periodicity they
feel is appropriate


253
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:17,436
for their security policies,


254
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:22,736
they can rotate the
institutional recovery key via


255
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:22,826
MDM [applause].


256
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:23,596
Thank you.


257
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:28,606
All right, we appreciate
your enthusiasm.


258
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,446
All right, moving on
to AirPlay Mirroring.


259
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,466
This is the feature that
I mentioned earlier.


260
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,026
I think it will be
great for both education


261
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:36,396
and enterprise deployments.


262
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:41,286
We are adding a new MDM command
that allows the MDM server


263
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,876
to tell a specific device
to begin AirPlay Mirroring


264
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,636
to a specific AirPlay
destination.


265
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,516
We're also providing
a new payload


266
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,736
that allows configuring
a whitelist


267
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,186
of allowed destinations on
supervised devices as well


268
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:57,206
as pre-configuring passwords
for AirPlay destinations


269
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,666
in the payload so that users
don't have to answer them.


270
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:03,726
And you can have the Apple TVs
locked down but still not have


271
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,256
to have each end user
know what the password is.


272
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,346
I'm also very pleased
to announce


273
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,446
that Apple TVs can now be
enrolled and managed via MDM.


274
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:18,486
[applause] We agree.


275
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,466
This is very exciting
including querying


276
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,896
and setting the language
in locale


277
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,356
and configuring our
network access including


278
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,446
to protect the 802.1X networks.


279
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:31,266
But that's just the first couple
that I wanted to highlight,


280
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:34,576
there's so much more including
the ability to install fonts


281
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:37,246
on both iOS and OS X via
configuration profile.


282
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:40,316
We've enhanced the Wi-Fi
payload to add support


283
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,196
for the new Wi-Fi Hotspot 2.0.


284
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:47,076
On iOS, we're allowing you to
configure AirPrint destinations.


285
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,056
All right, somebody's
using AirPrint?


286
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,626
Single App Mode is not new


287
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,396
but you can now configure a
lot more accessibility options


288
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,026
which we think will
be great in schools


289
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,226
for doing testing
on iOS devices.


290
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,646
We're also providing
a new payload


291
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:03,486
that provides web
content filtering


292
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:05,126
on supervised iOS devices.


293
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,906
And a few OS 10 specific
changes,


294
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,436
the exchange web services
payload is not new


295
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,496
but it now supports all
five account types; Context,


296
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:17,486
Calendars, Email,
Notes and Reminders.


297
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,476
[applause] The passcode policy
of course is not new either,


298
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,086
it's been supported all
along on both iOS and OS X,


299
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:30,566
but there were a small number
of settings that did not--


300
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,976
were not supported
on OS X and we now


301
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:36,186
in OS X Mavericks have
complete parody with iOS,


302
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,926
so you're being confident


303
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:41,526
that your passcode policies
are applied the same way


304
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,246
across both OS's.


305
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,566
There are also, as you can
see, many new restrictions,


306
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,486
the first six there
available only


307
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:53,276
on supervised devices including
preventing users from creating


308
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,636
or modifying accounts.


309
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:59,416
Again, another way to
help separate the data


310
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,146
between the users personal data
and the corporate secure data.


311
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,346
There's also a new restriction
controlling whether a supervised


312
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:10,166
devices can pair to other
Macs but I'm going to talk


313
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,446
about that more a bit
later in the session.


314
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,416
Finally, there are a number


315
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,286
of additional enhancements
to the MDM protocol.


316
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,696
I already mentioned one new
command, but there are a number


317
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:25,636
of new queries where you can
ask the device whether certain


318
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,936
features are enabled
or not; Mobile HotSpot,


319
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,456
Do Not Disturb, Find My iPhone.


320
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,106
And you can also ask the device


321
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,346
if it has an iTunes
account signed in.


322
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:37,916
In addition to the new command
to begin AirPlay Mirroring


323
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,396
to a destination, you can also
now set a custom lock screen


324
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:41,646
via MDM.


325
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,686
You can put the device
in lost mode


326
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,076
which adds contact
information to the lock screen,


327
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,836
so that if somebody
finds your lost device,


328
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:48,776
they can get it back to you.


329
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:52,306
And you can also disable
the Personal Hotspot.


330
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:58,206
So, that's a lot of work and
lot of talking by me and I now


331
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,816
like to ask Jussi
and Chris to come up


332
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,306
and show off those new managed
app enhancements that you were


333
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,056
so excited about and
they are really cool.


334
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:04,936
So, guys take it away.


335
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:10,636
[ Applause ]


336
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,236
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.


337
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:13,906
So, first I'm going
to show you some


338
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,876
of the new management
features for Managed Apps.


339
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,486
So, Todd mentioned
managed configuration


340
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:21,286
and managed feedback for
managed applications.


341
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:24,706
So, here I have a sample
application that seems


342
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,876
to be stuck in time
back in 1993.


343
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,816
If anybody remember or
saw San Jose Conferences,


344
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,866
can you raise your hand?


345
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,226
[applause] Oh, thank
you for coming back


346
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,056
and sticking with the platform.


347
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:35,136
So, this used to be Newton
App, if you remember,


348
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:38,756
and we can update it to some
modern conference location.


349
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:41,076
So, if Chris is now
sending an app update,


350
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,656
so you notice right now
we're in San Francisco,


351
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:44,896
we just came back to the future.


352
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:46,276
And what just happened is


353
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:49,096
that there was an application
configuration payload


354
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:53,586
that was sent over MDM, so this
app got an instantaneous update


355
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:57,036
of a Push Notification and
as an application developer,


356
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,006
you want to think of what
kind of settings would you


357
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,686
like to implement
as live updates?


358
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,016
This is effectively
life preferences


359
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,026
for some app settings.


360
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,906
And as an MDM vendor, you'd
want to implement the method


361
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:10,496
for sending these
application-specific payloads--


362
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,526
configuration payloads
that they're not--


363
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,376
the developer has
taken advantage of.


364
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,886
So, that's all fine and great


365
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:19,476
but then we also have
a support for feedback.


366
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,236
So, gathering feedback
from the application


367
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:25,046
and this is an awesome
conference if I could type that,


368
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,435
[inaudible] conference.


369
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,976
No, let's try that again.


370
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:33,536
[ Pause ]


371
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,096
Also in conference again.


372
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,956
And now, Chris is going
to send an MDM command.


373
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,016
Again, another command that MDM
vendors will want to implement


374
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:46,326
and let's see how that
output looks on the Console.


375
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:49,696
So, here we have a feedback
dictionary that's returned


376
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,966
over the MDM protocol
to the MDM server.


377
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,036
So, as an MDM vendor, given


378
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,276
that there's probably
several thousand applications


379
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,266
that will have managed
configuration preferences,


380
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,936
you will not necessarily
have able--


381
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:00,926
you will not be able


382
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,796
to implement a [inaudible]
mechanism or--


383
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,016
and reporting mechanism
for each every app.


384
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,056
So, what you want to do
is provide mechanisms


385
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:10,976
for this feedback data
that we gathered and stored


386
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,256
and then further process


387
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,376
by a site-specific
application or Backend.


388
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,816
So, you act as a conduit
for gathering feedback


389
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,836
from the application
and then delivering it


390
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:22,746
to some other application that
will then process it further.


391
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,776
So, that's a quick
overview of the App Feedback


392
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,886
and App Managed Preferences.


393
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,346
If you want to know more
about these specific features,


394
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:33,966
there's a session today at
3:15 regarding Extending Your


395
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,976
Applications for
Education and Enterprise use


396
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:38,376
and there'll be more information


397
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:40,036
about these specific
things there.


398
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:44,196
So, the next thing is Managed
Open In back to default.


399
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,826
So, enterprises.


400
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:51,306
So, we have apparently some
mail here and this seems


401
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,226
to be the new iOS
Enterprise Deployment Guide,


402
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:55,506
and that's great.


403
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,336
So, let's see if we can
send this over to somebody


404
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:02,126
that has a Dropbox
account or whatnot.


405
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,496
But that's not necessarily
ideal.


406
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,766
This is a draft document,
not to be shared.


407
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,006
So, I need to be able to
lock this account down


408
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:12,696
and restrict the ability of
this document to be shared.


409
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:17,086
So, with Managed Open In,
this mail account is managed.


410
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,396
So, my MDM payload
configured this account.


411
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,566
I also installed
some applications


412
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:23,876
as Managed Applications.


413
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,606
So, Chris is now going to
send a configuration profile


414
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:30,796
that restricts my ability
to open the document


415
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,126
in any other application
besides the ones


416
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:34,696
that the administrator
has chosen


417
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,856
for this app to be opened.


418
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:39,256
And you'll notice that
I just lost Dropbox,


419
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,846
I lost Google Drive, I only
have GoodReader as an option


420
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:43,796
to open this document in.


421
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,626
So, this is basically a way


422
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:50,076
of compartmentalizing
your application data


423
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,706
and your user data without
compromising the iOS


424
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:53,416
user experience.


425
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:53,526
So--


426
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:59,996e
[ Applause ]


427
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:03,496
So, that's Managed Open
In, and now back to Todd.


428
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,506
>> Todd Fernandez: All right,
thank you very much guys.


429
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,656
All right, so that's
already a lot of change


430
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:09,826
but we're just getting started.


431
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,126
Now, I'd like to talk to you


432
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,866
about the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.


433
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,326
Many of you may be aware
of this already, but today,


434
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:21,276
education enterprise
organizations can purchase app


435
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,616
and education books
codes in bulk.


436
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:27,896
The App Store or B2B
Store and MDM vendors many


437
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,346
of which have integrated code
management and distribution


438
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,836
into their MDM solutions
to enable organizations


439
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,906
to install those apps on
their end user systems.


440
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:40,366
But of course, this involves
managing spreadsheets


441
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:43,566
of redemption codes and
nobody really likes that,


442
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,406
for two reasons,
one, it's very clumsy


443
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:49,296
but more importantly it
involves a permanent transfer


444
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,026
of ownership of that
asset to the end user.


445
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,006
So, I'm very pleased to announce


446
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:58,006
that we are allowing
organizations


447
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,416
to purchase licenses
that are revocable


448
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:08,306
for apps instead of codes.


449
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:09,306
[applause] But that's not all.


450
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,286
We're adding Mac Apps
as well [applause].


451
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,686
We're adding books
for enterprise and--


452
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,146
all right fine, nobody wants


453
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,016
to read technical
manuals, I get it.


454
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,636
But even better for those of you
who are working on MDM products,


455
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:30,196
we're going to provide a
rich set of Web Services APIs


456
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,626
to allow you to fully
integrate this new system


457
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,756
into your products and
give a great experience


458
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:35,486
to our customers.


459
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,386
[applause] So, let's talk
about how this system is going


460
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,866
to work starting of course


461
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,756
with what the end
user will experience.


462
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:46,946
Once an assignment of one


463
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,396
of these revocable
licenses has been made,


464
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:52,196
the assigned app appears in
the user's purchase list just


465
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:53,686
as if they purchased
it themselves.


466
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:55,566
And that's great
for self-service,


467
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,066
they can then tap
it to download it.


468
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:59,636
But we are also providing
an MDM command


469
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:02,526
that allows the organization
to tell the device to install


470
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,656
that app, which will
then be a managed app


471
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,866
on iOS allowing enterprises
to get the right apps


472
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:12,116
on their employees' devices,
allowing schools to make sure


473
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:15,096
that the students have the
apps that they need to learn


474
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,896
and not be taking up class time.


475
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:18,686
So that's great.


476
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,336
That's how to get the
apps on the devices.


477
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,046
What about revoking a license


478
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:26,886
when an employee leaves their
job or student graduates?


479
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:29,836
Well, when the command
to revoke that license


480
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,776
from that particular user
is sent to the store,


481
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,026
that app will just
no longer appear


482
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,226
in that user's Purchased list.


483
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,936
That of course means that
it can no longer be updated


484
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,606
or redownloaded on
additional devices that has


485
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,276
that same iTunes
account logged in.


486
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:47,186
This will be notified that that
app has been revoked and prompt


487
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,856
to buy, which I'm
sure will make those


488
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:51,416
of you app developers happy
to buy their own copy.


489
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:55,546
Now, because the security model
is different on iOS from OS X,


490
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:56,806
there are some differences


491
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:59,656
in exactly how the Apple
behaves once it's been revoked.


492
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:03,786
On iOS, because apps are not
allowed to exit themselves,


493
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,566
the OS itself will enforce
that if the app will not launch


494
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,436
after a 30-day grace period
allowing the user time


495
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,476
to purchase their own copy.


496
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:16,136
On OS X, the app will
need to check the receipt


497
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:19,046
and once the receipt has
expired after that grace period,


498
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,566
the app can then quit on launch.


499
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:23,406
And for those of you
OS X app developers not


500
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:26,106
yet checking receipts, there's
a session later this week


501
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:26,946
that will teach you how to do it


502
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,826
and I will give you
all the details


503
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:29,716
at the end of this session.


504
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:34,466
All right, so that's
the end user experience.


505
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,476
Now, let's talk about what the
MDM product developers will need


506
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,876
to do to support
this new system.


507
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:43,296
And it really breaks down to
three areas of functionality.


508
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:46,516
First, authenticating this
organization's account


509
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,296
with the Volume Purchase
Program,


510
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:53,066
sending a user an invitation
to link their Apple ID


511
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,026
to your organization
and I'll talk much more


512
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:55,816
about that in a moment.


513
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,626
And then of course the
heart of the matter,


514
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,766
being able to assign licenses,
to be able to revoke them


515
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,566
and then assign into
some other user.


516
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,726
So let's talk about
each one in turn.


517
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,936
The organization will
obtain a secure token


518
00:24:10,086 --> 00:24:12,136
from the VPP website
where they're going


519
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:14,096
to purchase their
content in bulk.


520
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,106
This works great because
then you don't have


521
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,966
to store their credentials
for them, you just need


522
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,476
to provide URI for them
to enter their token.


523
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,846
It's relatively long-lived
but will currently plan


524
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,096
to expire after a year.


525
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,456
So, it is something
that they will have


526
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,416
to do periodically
but not frequently.


527
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,026
Now, user invitations.


528
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,476
This is a really
important part of the system


529
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,866
that preserves user privacy.


530
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:41,186
We don't want to force users to
reveal their private Apple ID


531
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:43,246
to the organization or
the school that's going


532
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:44,886
to provide them with
this content.


533
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:48,346
So there's a one-time
process to link their Apple ID


534
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:51,376
with the organization providing
content in the iTunes Store.


535
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:56,666
The MDM server will request
an individual URL for the user


536
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,736
that they are tracking in their
system and then be able to use


537
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,446
that URL to construct
an invitation


538
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:05,436
and they can send it via
email, construct a web portal,


539
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,686
or send it over MDM, which
we think is the best approach


540
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:10,556
if the user has a
device enrolled


541
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:14,436
that the MDM server knows about
and we'll show that later on.


542
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:18,046
Finally, the process


543
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:19,536
of the assigning license
couldn't be easier.


544
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,056
The MDM server can--
once it's authenticated,


545
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:25,476
the account with the iTunes
Store can request the list


546
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:28,236
of app and book purchases
that organization has made.


547
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,566
They can send request to
say assign this list of apps


548
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,116
and books to these
lists of users.


549
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:37,626
And then, if desired,
that's already sufficient


550
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:40,006
to get the content out to
those users, but if they want


551
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,816
to tell the device to
install the app on the device,


552
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,446
they can send the
MDM command out.


553
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,576
Revocations are the opposite.


554
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:51,486
They can send a list of
revoked licenses for this app


555
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,406
from these lists of users.


556
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:59,536
However, book assignments
just like code based model,


557
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:02,226
it's still permanent, a
transfer of ownership.


558
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:04,706
We decide to add that
to the new system


559
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,446
because that will enable
MDM providers as well


560
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:10,006
as organizations to use the
same system to manage both types


561
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,296
of content, but for
now at least,


562
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:13,846
book assignments are permanent.


563
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,296
All right, let me
give you a short--


564
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,246
walk you through a short
architecture diagram


565
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,466
to give you another
way of thinking


566
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,706
about the way the system works.


567
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,926
Each organization will go
to the [inaudible] website


568
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,256
and purchase whatever
app and book licenses


569
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,106
that they wish to have.


570
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,826
That information flows
into the iTunes Store.


571
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:35,496
The MDM server can query the
iTunes Store for those licenses


572
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,686
and then send up requests
to make assignments.


573
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:42,646
Once that's been done, the
device can check in with the--


574
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,036
the device will be notified


575
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,566
to pull its Purchased
list and update its UI.


576
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:51,246
At that time, again, the user
can freely download those


577
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:56,336
assigned apps and books or the
MDM server can send the command


578
00:26:56,466 --> 00:27:00,396
down to the device to tell it
to download particular book


579
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:03,006
or books-- sorry,
particular app or apps.


580
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:07,146
All right, so let's get down
another level into details


581
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,456
of how these APIs will work
and how you'll use them.


582
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,816
There's a common URL prefix


583
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,936
that then you'll append
the specific service


584
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:15,846
that you want to use.


585
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:20,056
Now, the various tips and
advice that I will pass along


586
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,896
through the remainder of
this section of the session.


587
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:25,306
One-- Important one is not the
hard code, those service URLs.


588
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,886
They may change over
time but the ser--


589
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:30,616
the VPPServiceConfigSrv
will always be able


590
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,566
to provide you the
latest service URLs.


591
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:38,156
You'll provide the parameters to
these services as JSON strings


592
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,456
and the secure token


593
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,476
that I mentioned
earlier will be provided


594
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,736
with all service requests
to authenticate the call.


595
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:49,406
What you'll get back
is also in JSON format.


596
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,036
If there are any fields
that don't have a value,


597
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,416
those will not be included.


598
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,496
And, if for some strange
reason there's an error,


599
00:27:56,566 --> 00:28:00,716
you'll get both an ErrorNumber
and user readable ErrorMessage


600
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:04,716
that you can provide
in your UI to the user.


601
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,726
I want to clarify that.


602
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,286
An ErrorMessage will map
back to a single ErrorNumber,


603
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,756
unique ErrorNumber but each
ErrorNumber may represent a


604
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,226
number of different user
visible ErrorMessages.


605
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:17,556
And just to give you an
idea of the kinds of errors


606
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:20,086
that may happen, of course,
they'll never be any errors


607
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,986
but you probably should
handle them anyway.


608
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,276
All right, now let me walk
you through a specific example


609
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,876
of how you would use
one of the services


610
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,316
and this service is the one


611
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,626
where you actually
associate a particular license


612
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,076
with a particular user
effectively assigning it


613
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,016
to them.


614
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,616
Provide some information
including the secure token,


615
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:42,536
call the service, and then the
response might look something


616
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,746
like this where you get
some additional details


617
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:47,196
about the license that's been
assigned including its ID,


618
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:48,956
whether it's revocable or not.


619
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,736
Some other details
about what that app was.


620
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:54,616
You also get all the
details about the user.


621
00:28:55,176 --> 00:28:58,356
And there are several different
ways to reference the user


622
00:28:58,356 --> 00:28:59,716
and I'm going to cover
that in a moment.


623
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:03,576
So breaking this down
into their various tasks,


624
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,016
you need to perform and the
services that you'll use


625
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,036
to perform those tasks.


626
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:09,706
I already mentioned
the VPPServiceConfigSrv


627
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,686
that you'll use to
fetch the current names


628
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,996
for all of these services.


629
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:17,286
The registered VPPUserSrv is
what you will use to obtain


630
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:20,836
that individualized invitation
URL to construct the invitation


631
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,886
to invite users to
link to the program.


632
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:28,596
There's a service that will
allow you to get all the details


633
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:31,616
about a specific user including
any licenses currently assigned


634
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:32,176
to that user.


635
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,096
You can of course get
a list of all the users


636
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:38,366
in your organization including
fetching only the users


637
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,246
that have been modified


638
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,226
since the last time you
downloaded the list.


639
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,056
You can also request a
list of every license


640
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,166
that that organization
has purchased including


641
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:50,106
if there is a user
assigned to any of them.


642
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,116
And then finally, the pair-- the
one that I showed you an example


643
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:56,506
of that actually
assigns a license


644
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,066
to a user and then revokes it.


645
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,176
There are a few additional
services


646
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,636
that performs an important
housekeeping tasks including


647
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,406
if you want to update
any of the user metadata,


648
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:09,266
if you want to store
some additional metadata


649
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:14,736
for the organization, and if
a user leaves the organization


650
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:18,766
for whatever reason or no longer
needs to be provided assets,


651
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:20,916
you can retire that user


652
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,776
and disassociate
their iTunes account


653
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,616
which will also revoke any
revocable licenses currently


654
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,516
assigned to that user.


655
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:31,006
You can of course later reinvite
that retired user if desired


656
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,386
by passing along their
previous user string


657
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,566
to the registered service.


658
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,436
Now, I mentioned earlier
there are a number


659
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,256
of different user
concepts within the system.


660
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,906
So let's talk about that now.


661
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,716
The first is your MDM
solutions idea of the user.


662
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,276
That's represented in the system
by the client user ID string,


663
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,716
which is typically
going to be a UUID


664
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,876
and this may be the
representation coming


665
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,116
out of the directory
that's feeding users


666
00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,276
in groups into your solution.


667
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:03,366
The second is the VPP--


668
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:05,536
the Volume Purchase
Programs ID of the user.


669
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:07,286
And that's represented
by the user ID.


670
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,566
Finally, there's
the user's Apple ID,


671
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:13,356
which again we don't want to
reveal to the MDM solution


672
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:14,276
and the organization,


673
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:18,286
so you will receive
Hash of that Apple ID.


674
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,326
So there's three kinds
of users can be combined


675
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,686
at the two different key forms
or the ways that represent--


676
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,846
or referring to a
particular user.


677
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,716
The user ID is just
a single long


678
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:33,076
and then the other form is tuple
of the client user ID string,


679
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:36,446
again typically UUID and
the Hash of the Apple ID.


680
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:40,166
Now, these two key forms
have a one-to-one association


681
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,756
at any one given time,
but that's not immutable,


682
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:47,116
that link can change if a
user is retired and reinvited.


683
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:51,346
So, let's talk a little
about the user ID key form.


684
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,656
This one is very easy
to track as it's just


685
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:58,276
that one single long
integer, and as I mentioned,


686
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:01,386
it's always tied to exactly
one client user ID string


687
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:05,216
but that reference can
change, and in fact can change


688
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,076
when the user accepts
the invitation.


689
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:11,076
So, I'm going to illustrate that
again with a little diagram.


690
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:15,296
So, at this point, the
MDM solution has its idea


691
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:19,466
of what this user's UUID
is from their directory


692
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,806
and has called the
register service


693
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:25,546
to obtain an individualized
URL for that user,


694
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,956
which now is identified
with user ID2 .


695
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,456
That invitation sent
out to the user


696
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,626
and when the user accepts it,
the MDM server will be provided


697
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,196
with the Hash of that Apple ID.


698
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,796
Now, let's imagine that
for whatever reason


699
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:44,336
that user is retired, and in
fact this is not the first time


700
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,476
that this has happened,
there was a former user ID1,


701
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:52,906
but now retired that link,
generate a new invitation


702
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:55,816
for user ID3 which could be
sent out to the user again


703
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,866
which could accept-- who could
accept it with the same Apple ID


704
00:32:58,866 --> 00:32:59,896
or different Apple ID.


705
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,266
Now, let's talk about
the other key form based


706
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:07,716
on the MDM's servers
idea of the user.


707
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:11,506
Now, this more directly
maps between the MDM user


708
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:16,986
and the Apple ID be it Hash.


709
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,236
What you'll see is that
that hash will be null


710
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,356
until the end user has
accepted the invitation.


711
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,976
Once the user has accepted the
invitation that hash uniquely


712
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:28,706
and of course opaquely refers
to that end user's Apple ID,


713
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,486
however, there is a potential
problem here when you send


714
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,276
out an invitation


715
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,986
for a particular
client user ID string.


716
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,236
If that invitation,
for whatever reason


717
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,746
and let's say a student
forwards their invitation to one


718
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:40,546
of their classmates,


719
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,716
two different Apple IDs
can accept that invitation.


720
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,186
There's no way to prevent that


721
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,396
but this is almost certainly
something the admin is going


722
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,186
to want to know about.


723
00:33:50,576 --> 00:33:54,666
Primarily because in that case,
there will be two MDM users


724
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,496
and two VPP users and they
will allocate two licenses


725
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:02,476
for an app perhaps
but they will not get


726
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:03,576
to two different Apple IDs,


727
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:05,476
two different actual
users on devices.


728
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,386
So again, let me illustrate
this with a simple diagram.


729
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,735
Imagine two different MDM users.


730
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,626
The MDM server generates


731
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:15,876
or requests two different
invitation URLs and sends


732
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:16,846
out those invitations.


733
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,746
One of them is accepted
with a particular Apple ID


734
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:24,235
and the other one is
accepted by the same Apple ID.


735
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:26,186
And this is the state
that you want to detect


736
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:30,106
and alert the user of
your admin console of.


737
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,446
So again, emphasize that there--


738
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:37,476
there's only one
active VPP user account


739
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,775
for any given client user
ID string at one time.


740
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:42,906
You're going to use that
string to identify this


741
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,835
if you're using this
key form as opposed


742
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,666
to the user ID VPP key form.


743
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:52,636
If you want to get a retired
user back, you'll also have


744
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:57,056
to provide the Hash that
you had for that user.


745
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,826
So now I want to pass
along some advice from some


746
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,766
of the engineers on my team who
are the first to adopt this API


747
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,706
and they have some
things that they'd


748
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:05,576
like me to share with you.


749
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,386
So one important decision is
which key form you want to use


750
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,596
and they strongly recommend
that you choose one of them


751
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,386
and always use that consistently
because if you want--


752
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:15,726
if you try to mix them,
you're going to have


753
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,616
to very carefully keep
them strictly in sync.


754
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:24,496
Next, I want to talk about
a few individual areas


755
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,346
of the system, first, users.


756
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,956
When choo-- I've already
mentioned this several times


757
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:33,066
that when you're choosing
what to represent each user


758
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:37,396
in your MDM Solution, you
want to pick a Primary Key


759
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,696
that won't change so you
don't want to use a username


760
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,266
or an email address
'cause you won't be able


761
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,466
to change this once they have
been invited and enrolled.


762
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,506
We strongly recommend a UUID.


763
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:51,996
You can make your server
the truth for user accounts


764
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,696
but you're going to have to
handle retired accounts then


765
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,936
which you can always fetch using


766
00:35:56,936 --> 00:36:02,856
to get VPP user service
'cause users may unenroll


767
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,956
from the service,
you may retire them.


768
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:08,516
You can always reregister that
user and send a new invitation


769
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:14,846
but of course that may be
linked from a new Apple ID.


770
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,466
One important reason to keep
track of retired users is


771
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,956
that if you have actually
transferred any irrevocable


772
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:24,346
licenses for books because you
won't want to assign another--


773
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:27,876
if the user was retired by
accident or for whatever reason,


774
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:30,316
the student came back to
school, you don't want to end


775
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:33,176
up transferring a second
irrevocable book license to them


776
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:34,106
when they already have one.


777
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,806
Next, let's talk a little
bit more about licenses.


778
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:42,766
So similar to not relying on
the names of the service URLs,


779
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,246
you don't want to assume
that you know forever


780
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:47,796
which license types are
revocable and which are not.


781
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:50,736
You want to always use-- is
that irrevocable attribute


782
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,486
to determine whether a
particular license can


783
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:52,996
be revoked.


784
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:58,096
Another important consideration
is how to handle the difference


785
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,066
between assigning a
license to the user


786
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,676
and actually sending
the MDM Command


787
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:07,966
to tell the device
to install that app.


788
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,166
You can assign licenses before
inviting the user has accepted


789
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:16,176
the invitation and associate
their Apple ID but you may want


790
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:18,616
to wait until they've actually
accepted the invitation


791
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,556
and that you have a
hash for their Apple ID


792
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,576
because you don't want to end
up assigning licenses to users


793
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,936
that never actually used them.


794
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,896
And you want to incur-- make
it easy for organizations


795
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,016
to prevent that from happening.


796
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:32,656
Now similarly, you can make
the MDM Server the truth


797
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:35,406
for revocable license
assignments but you don't have


798
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:37,696
to worry about tracking
unassigned license IDs


799
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:40,456
because when you call that
service to assign a license


800
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,526
to a user, it will pick one


801
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,086
of the unassigned
licenses from the pool.


802
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,316
However, once you've assigned
a revocable license you do want


803
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,346
to track those because
you'll need the license ID


804
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:53,576
in order to revoke them.


805
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:58,806
Finally, when thinking about
installing apps in the command,


806
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:02,346
you've probably in the UI want
to separate the assignment


807
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,466
from the installation.


808
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:06,176
It may seem at first like a
great idea to be able to do both


809
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:10,066
at once but because of
the hugely scalable nature


810
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:12,156
of the iTunes Store,
there may be some delay


811
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,766
in the notification of--


812
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,806
to the device that
assignment has been made


813
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,696
and if the command comes
in before the assignment,


814
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,396
before the device
knows it's entitled


815
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:21,906
to that app, it will fail.


816
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,896
There's also the
possibility that a student


817
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,816
for whatever reason may
have signed out with


818
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,746
that iTunes account and if the--
that account is not signed in,


819
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,786
the device won't know that
it's authorized for that app


820
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:38,116
and again, the command
will fail.


821
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:41,326
So in summarizing, we
have made some big changes


822
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:43,046
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.


823
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:45,096
We've added revocable
app assignments.


824
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,016
We've allowed new systems


825
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,776
that also support
permanent book assignments.


826
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,446
There's a new MDM
Command to tell the device


827
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:53,786
to install whatever apps
are assigned to them.


828
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,436
All of these is fully
integrated with iOS Managed apps


829
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,656
so that organizations
can be confident


830
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:03,056
in using this new system while
still protecting their secured


831
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:06,336
data being used by those apps,
whatever those apps may be


832
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:10,476
and all of this works really
great with OS X caching server


833
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:13,866
so that even if a
school for example needs


834
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:18,656
to assign a thousand copies of
20 apps to all their devices


835
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,756
on campus, they can only--


836
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:23,096
they only have to download
each app once to their site


837
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:24,016
to the caching server.


838
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:28,486
And with that, I'd like to turn


839
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:30,586
to our final section
of the session today.


840
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,436
And I know some of you might
be wondering what I mean


841
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,816
by Streamlined Device
Enrollment.


842
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:37,276
Well, those of you
who have worked


843
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,666
on MDM products have already
had to solve this problem


844
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,656
of how do I establish
that initial connection


845
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,656
from each device back
to my MDM server.


846
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:47,366
Some of you have created
apps for the App Store.


847
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,826
Some of you created web
portals but those require


848
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,376
that the organization using your
product then train their users


849
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,516
how to use those apps,
where to find them,


850
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,276
how to complete the enrollment.


851
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:59,556
Some of you have documented
how to use our own tools


852
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,196
like Apple Configurator to
complete that initial step.


853
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,786
But wouldn't it be easier
if we gave you this.


854
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:09,836
[laughter] An easy button
for device enrollment.


855
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:13,016
We think so.


856
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:14,966
We think this will be great
both for the organization


857
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,036
and for the end users and
that's what we're doing.


858
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,926
We're adding a new
enrollment method solely


859
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,886
for devices purchased
by an organization.


860
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:27,136
This is not for BYOD but for
organization-owned devices,


861
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:28,576
there's two steps.


862
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,856
One for the organization, they
need to provide a small number


863
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:35,506
of settings for how they want
this enrollment to be performed


864
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:36,776
to this new Apple service


865
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,336
and we have integrated the
enrollment process right


866
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:43,826
into the Setup Assistant in
both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks


867
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:46,546
to give the user the
standard out-of-box device


868
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:46,986
experience [applause].


869
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,576
So let's talk about
how this will look


870
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,836
from both the organization
and the end user perspective.


871
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:57,106
So what's the workflow


872
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,276
for an organization now
using this new service?


873
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:01,826
Well, they hopefully
order lots and lots


874
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,666
of Apple devices from us.


875
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:07,636
They assign those devices
to this new service.


876
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,106
They decide which settings
that they want to use


877
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,376
for those devices to be enrolled


878
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,256
and they can use different
settings for different groups


879
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,506
of devices, for example
different schools.


880
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:21,196
They receive their shipment of
the devices and they hand them


881
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,946
out in the box to
their end user.


882
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:25,396
That's all they have to do.


883
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,656
[applause] So what does the
user do when they get this box?


884
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:31,656
Well, they open it just


885
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,316
as if they purchased it
from the Apple store.


886
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:36,046
They begin walking through
the Standard Setup Assistant.


887
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:40,596
They choose their network
then they're prompted


888
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:43,596
by your MDM Solution for
credentials to authenticate


889
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:45,486
who they are to make sure


890
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,566
that only authorized
users are enrolling


891
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,996
in the Device Management
System deployed


892
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:55,146
by that organization, that's it.


893
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:56,896
So let's start talking
about a little bit of--


894
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:57,706
few of the details.


895
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,326
There are a couple
of critical settings,


896
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:03,176
the most important one
is the URL for enrolling


897
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:04,796
in your Device Management
Solutions.


898
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:09,256
There's also an option the
organization can decide whether


899
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,556
or not they want to allow
the user to skip enrollment


900
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:14,106
or whether they want to make it
mandatory and prevent the user


901
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:16,276
from preceding through
setup and using the device


902
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:18,856
without accepting enrollment
in Remote Device Management.


903
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:23,116
There are a few additional
options specific to iOS devices,


904
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,906
first of which is that you--
the organization could decide


905
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:28,846
that they want to
supervise these devices.


906
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,726
You may not realize
what that means,


907
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:33,076
you'll no longer be required


908
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:35,126
to use Apple Configurators
Supervised devices.


909
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:37,056
It can now be done
over-the-air using this new


910
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:37,956
enrollment service.


911
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,246
[applause] I alluded to
this earlier but in addition


912
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,896
to that change to supervision,


913
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:47,666
we're also separating
the concept


914
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,356
of supervision giving you access
to additional restrictions


915
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:52,736
in settings from the
pairing restrictions


916
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,796
and the organization can now
choose whether or not they want


917
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:57,656
to prevent the supervised device


918
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,706
from pairing from--
with any Mac.


919
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:04,206
[applause] We think this
will be great in schools


920
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,966
where students-- where
schools really want


921
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,596
to have the additional
restrictions


922
00:43:07,596 --> 00:43:09,916
but also want their students
to be able to connect a Mac--


923
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:13,236
or sorry connect an iOS device
to a Mac to get their photo


924
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:15,866
or video content off to
edit in iPhoto or iMovie.


925
00:43:16,656 --> 00:43:19,946
And then finally, I think
you'll like this as well,


926
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,876
for devices that have been
enrolled using this new service,


927
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,906
the organization can also
choose to prevent their users


928
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:28,516
from removing MDM enrollment


929
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:30,836
so that they can be confident
the device will continue


930
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:32,656
to be enrolled and
manageable over-the-air.


931
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:37,946
Now that's all great, that's
all about device enrollment,


932
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:39,336
but we didn't stop there either.


933
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:42,806
We also wanted to streamline
the entire setup experience


934
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,226
so that part of the Settings


935
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:47,186
of this new service also allow
an organization to decide


936
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:49,486
to skip certain panes
in the setup assistant.


937
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,556
For example, if a school doesn't
want to ask their 10-year-olds


938
00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:54,966
to decide whether or not they
want a location service is


939
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,636
enabled or whether they're going


940
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:01,166
to send diagnostics
back to Apple.


941
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,726
So again, let's turn from
the way the feature--


942
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:06,276
the system works to
what work you need to do


943
00:44:06,826 --> 00:44:08,666
and it again breaks
down to three areas.


944
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:13,056
Similar account authentication
to the new App Store VPP.


945
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:16,666
You'll need to create a settings
editor for that small handful


946
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,406
of settings for the--


947
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,716
your customers to be able


948
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:20,696
to specify how they want
their devices enrolled.


949
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,436
And you'll need to be able to
communicate with the new service


950
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,416
to tell it which groups
the device you should get


951
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,246
which settings.


952
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:33,116
So walk you through an
architecture diagram


953
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:34,176
to show you how this will work.


954
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:37,306
The organization
purchases devices.


955
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,736
They add those devices
into this new service.


956
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,596
Your MDM Solution talks to
the enrollment service to find


957
00:44:44,596 --> 00:44:47,596
out the list of devices that
are eligible for this service,


958
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:50,086
pushes up the settings for
groups of those devices.


959
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,696
Once that's been done,
as devices start to go


960
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:54,766
through the setup assistant,


961
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:57,816
they contact the enrollment
service to get their Settings


962
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:02,486
and enroll in your MDM Server
which can then manage them


963
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:03,546
in all of the ways we've talked


964
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:05,346
about earlier via
the MDM Protocol


965
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:06,566
and Configuration Profiles.


966
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,846
So again there are a
couple of these tasks


967
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:13,666
and there are services
that you'll use


968
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:17,116
to perform those tasks to
get started with the service,


969
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:19,126
to get the account details
for that organization,


970
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:20,726
to fetch the device list,


971
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,796
handling the settings
whether you're defining them


972
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:27,836
and pushing them up to the
service and then assigning them


973
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:30,296
to groups of devices and
fetching the settings back.


974
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,586
And then some more
housekeeping services


975
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,916
that fetch specific
details about devices.


976
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,476
If you have to remove
devices from the services


977
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:39,986
if an organization sells them.


978
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,956
Or to remove settings that
they're no longer using.


979
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:49,556
And so just to further encourage
you to integrate this service


980
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:50,636
as quickly as possible,


981
00:45:50,636 --> 00:45:52,866
I just want to quickly
illustrate what the OS X setup


982
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:54,496
experience looks like today.


983
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:58,526
You have to go through these 14
screens to get to where you want


984
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:02,336
to be which is that user-- using
their Mac to work or learn.


985
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,886
Now I know you want
to see what it looks


986
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:07,286
like using the service fully.


987
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,186
But I don't want to show
it to you in slides.


988
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,296
I'm going to ask you to Jussi
and Chris to come back up


989
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:14,726
and show you the-- both of
these systems working together


990
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,876
so that all of you are really
excited about going off


991
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,366
and integrating both
of these services


992
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:21,536
so that together we can
provide our customers


993
00:46:21,576 --> 00:46:23,886
with an outstanding
setup experience


994
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,156
in education and enterprise.


995
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:27,466
So we're going to show
you from taking the device


996
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:31,146
out of the box, enrolling it in
MDM and assigning it content.


997
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,426
So guys, take it away.


998
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:35,226
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.


999
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,106
So I'm not going to have
my Mac Book in a box.


1000
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:41,006
So this is basically
imagine if this came in a box


1001
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:43,576
on a container of like
thousands of Mac Books


1002
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:45,586
and this is the setup that
I'm going to go through.


1003
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:49,436
So power it up and I get
to see some of the panes


1004
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:51,446
that I usually see, and it's not


1005
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:53,776
that this setup experiences
is really slow today, I mean,


1006
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:55,966
we have pretty fast going
through the setup today.


1007
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:59,226
This is just faster than
what we have right now.


1008
00:46:59,656 --> 00:47:02,096
So I set my country,
set my keyboard


1009
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:03,546
and the first thing that's--


1010
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,486
or it still needs
to pick a network.


1011
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:11,586
So let's go to ACME Wi-Fi, I
you have to Wi-Fi, go ACME.


1012
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:15,036
And what Todd is--
Todd is explaining is


1013
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:18,236
that we have MDM sever that has
implemented this streamlined


1014
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,286
device enrollment protocol.


1015
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:23,216
So now, my setup assistant
has just contacted Apple.


1016
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,676
So what happened is
that the configuration


1017
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:28,766
for this machine was found
in the Apple services


1018
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:31,536
and it basically said
you are called ACME, Inc.


1019
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:33,826
Here's the number to call if
you don't know what this is


1020
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,236
and would you like to
apply these settings.


1021
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:39,396
So-- and in this case, I have
an option of skipping this


1022
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,326
or accepting the configuration.


1023
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:45,346
So I will accept
this configuration.


1024
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,306
And now what happened is


1025
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:50,806
that the configuration
contains a call home URL.


1026
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,436
So the MDM server
has a new feature


1027
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,876
for authenticating users.


1028
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:58,176
So this system is no longer
talking to Apple services.


1029
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,146
This now talking to an MDM
server that will be hosted


1030
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:03,986
by the organization would
be in the company or in--


1031
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:07,106
at school and the username
password is what I would use


1032
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:10,476
to log in to that company's,
that school's systems.


1033
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:13,246
So I will be-- in this
case, I will be Jack.


1034
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,946
And Jack is going to
have a password hopefully


1035
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:17,536
that I can remember.


1036
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:21,636
And now we are done
with the configuration.


1037
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:24,086
So I still have to
create a local pass--


1038
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,336
local user for this machine.


1039
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:32,026
And there it goes,
Jack and that's it.


1040
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:35,456
So if you saw the-- saw the
screens that we have before,


1041
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:38,866
we didn't get to see a do I
want to register this machine


1042
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:40,506
because this was
organization purchased.


1043
00:48:40,706 --> 00:48:41,636
It doesn't really make sense


1044
00:48:41,636 --> 00:48:43,316
to have the individuals
still register it again.


1045
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:47,426
I didn't get to see an Apple ID
because the organization decided


1046
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,926
that that may not be applicable
for this system or this user.


1047
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,476
And here we are.


1048
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:53,426
We are ready to set
the system or ready


1049
00:48:53,426 --> 00:48:54,716
to put the system in use.


1050
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:58,976
And I land finder with a
wonderful and new background.


1051
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:00,636dle
Here we go.


1052
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:00,636
Here we go.


1053
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:01,466
Let's go surfing.


1054
00:49:01,846 --> 00:49:07,436
And when I go to my
preferences I noticed


1055
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:09,836
that I already have a
enrollment profile here.


1056
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:13,956
So I have a system-- I have
a profile that was installed


1057
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:16,666
on the system as part of
enrolling into the MDM service.


1058
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,756
So here I have remote
management already enabled


1059
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:22,996
and now the organization
can send me any profiles


1060
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:24,806
that are applicable
for this user


1061
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:27,456
on this system and
I'm good to go.


1062
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,886
So that's the setup
experience on the Mac.


1063
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:35,656
[ Applause ]


1064
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:39,516
So an iOS device, so I
have an iPhone in the box


1065
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,266
that I did cut open, sorry,


1066
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:43,736
so we get to have the
nice woosh effect.


1067
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:44,996
Here we go.


1068
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:47,966
And I did power it
on, sorry, I cheated.


1069
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,506
So it's already on.


1070
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:51,906
So if and go to the
phone please.


1071
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,076
There we go.


1072
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,846
I could learn lots
of languages here.


1073
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,856
I think that means caller.


1074
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,666
Let's go set this up.


1075
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,156
Here we go.


1076
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:04,576
So again, I get to
choose my language.


1077
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:07,076
I'm still in the US.


1078
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:10,486
I get to choose my
ACME Wi-Fi again.


1079
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:13,916
So here, the configuration
profile that was downloaded


1080
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:17,806
from the streamlined device
enrollment service now got the


1081
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,836
record from Apple again.


1082
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:22,946
And we know that
this device needs


1083
00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:24,076
to be configured for the system.


1084
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,746
And you'll notice that I
don't have an option to skip.


1085
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:31,426
So I have to go through this
setup assistant or the iOS setup


1086
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:33,496
with this configuration
from my organization.


1087
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:36,276
So there's no option to opt out.


1088
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:39,456
So again, I'll configure
this device.


1089
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:43,156
And again I'll log
into my company account


1090
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,086
and again this device
is now talking


1091
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:47,936
to the MDM server
authentication part that's going


1092
00:50:47,936 --> 00:50:50,456
to be implemented by all the
new MDM servers out there.


1093
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:59,906
So I'll log in here, and I
get configurations set down.


1094
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:02,726
And here we are installing
the configuration


1095
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,276
from a company and
I'm good to go.


1096
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:08,576
So here I am in my home screen.


1097
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:11,776
I have a basically a clean
system but now if I go


1098
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:15,506
to my settings and
look at some details.


1099
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:18,606
So notice that this
device is supervised.


1100
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:22,396
So this device was not
connected to Apple Configurator.


1101
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,656
It was never plugged
into any system


1102
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:26,136
but it's already supervised.


1103
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:28,046
So I can now take
advantage of some


1104
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,876
of the new supervised features


1105
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,756
like installing [inaudible]
apps, doing other restrictions


1106
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,356
that wouldn't apply to
non-supervised devices.


1107
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:38,646
So this is supervision without
tethering using the streamlined


1108
00:51:38,646 --> 00:51:40,206
device configuration service.


1109
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:43,156
And other part is
that you'll notice


1110
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:44,966
that I have configuration
profiles installed.


1111
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:47,716
And if I'm looking
at my MDM profile,


1112
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:49,376
there is no remove button.


1113
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:53,116
So the only way-- [applause]
thank you, yes, yes please.


1114
00:51:55,806 --> 00:51:59,796
There's no way for the user
to exit the management state


1115
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:02,576
and if they restore the phone,


1116
00:52:02,576 --> 00:52:04,296
basically erase/install
the phone,


1117
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:07,436
it will still have the
streamlined device on its record


1118
00:52:07,736 --> 00:52:09,446
in the cloud-- in
the Apple Cloud


1119
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,196
and because this device is
required to have this setup,


1120
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,006
you can't bypass the setup
assistant and you'll always end


1121
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:15,866
up this management
state [applause].


1122
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:21,886
OK, so that's fine and good.


1123
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:24,216
We seem to have lack
of application.


1124
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:27,236
I could spend days just looking
at stocks and playing videos.


1125
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:29,656
But let's see what
apps this user has.


1126
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:31,756
Well, it's an out-of-box system


1127
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,806
so I don't have an
Apple ID signed in.


1128
00:52:34,146 --> 00:52:44,326
So let me go and sign
up with my ID here.


1129
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:45,246
Oops. Oops.


1130
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:48,206
OK, this is the demo
typing that's happening.


1131
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,746
And you would spell that right.


1132
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:54,166
There we go.


1133
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:57,906
And then hopefully,
password is right.


1134
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:02,826
And now log out.


1135
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:07,726
So we have an Apple ID and
now we have some updates.


1136
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,246
Oh sorry, not updates,
applications.


1137
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:12,076
So this user has already
purchased some applications.


1138
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:14,396
So here's my application list.


1139
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,126
And these are effective
with the free apps by Apple.


1140
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,996
So this user has a free Apple ID


1141
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,686
with no credit card
associated with that.


1142
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,246
That's kind of an anomaly.


1143
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:24,986
Usually people do
buy apps for cash.


1144
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:27,716
But in this case, this
has no CC on file.


1145
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:31,656
So Chris is now going to assign
applications to this device.


1146
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:35,486
So Chris is going to send
a list of applications


1147
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:38,116
that the organization
has licenses for, OK.


1148
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:39,356
Oh I'm sorry.


1149
00:53:39,356 --> 00:53:41,176
I'm skipping ahead of myself.


1150
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:44,346
So how do we get this
user into this program?


1151
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,716
Yes. We need to invite
that person.


1152
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:48,236
And there are many ways


1153
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:50,896
of getting the user
invited into program.


1154
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:54,356
We can direct the user into a
portal or we can send an email


1155
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:56,606
and we can send a
push notification.


1156
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:59,706
So first I'm going
to show you an email


1157
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:01,806
that the MDM console
is going to send.


1158
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:06,046
And that'll show up in
the device momentarily.


1159
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:09,046
So here we have an
invitation email


1160
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:12,336
that is basically asking the
user to enroll their Apple ID


1161
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:14,036
with the corporate email.


1162
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,356
So Apple does not know
what this email address is.


1163
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:19,856
This is only for
the user to know


1164
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,096
and then the user can
bind their Apple ID


1165
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,386
and this corporate email account


1166
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,606
and then they can
assign licenses.


1167
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:32,356
But-- and this email is a URL
and that URL can be on a webpage


1168
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:34,386
so depending on how the
MDM vendor would want


1169
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:35,036
to implement this.


1170
00:54:35,256 --> 00:54:38,416
As long as they find a way to
display that URL to the user


1171
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:41,426
and have the user click
that, then we're good to go.


1172
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,966
So another way to
invite this user is


1173
00:54:43,966 --> 00:54:46,806
by sending a push command.


1174
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:50,706
And now we get to log in to
the App Store or we get--


1175
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:52,176
we are brought back
to the App Store.


1176
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:55,446
And we know that OK,
this organization would


1177
00:54:55,446 --> 00:54:57,586
like to assign applications
for this ID.


1178
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:00,586
And yes, now we got
three pushes.


1179
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:02,906
So yes, I will allow apps
to be assigned to this.


1180
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:08,956
And now, we have the user ID
that the email was sent to


1181
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:11,666
and the account that
was associated


1182
00:55:11,696 --> 00:55:13,616
with this ID, now
they are linked.


1183
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:17,036
And I've been just sitting here
and what Chris has been doing


1184
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,936
as the survey admin, he is
assigned applications to me.


1185
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,956
So they just show up
in my purchase list.


1186
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:23,796
So I guess I have
a checklist thing.


1187
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,226
I need to know what to do.


1188
00:55:25,226 --> 00:55:28,216
I have a things app
I need to learn math.


1189
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:31,356
So these are the licensees
that the company has licensed


1190
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:32,566
and assigned to this user.


1191
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:34,646
And they show up in
my purchase list.


1192
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,026
But even better way instead


1193
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:40,156
of just having me pull
this application stone,


1194
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:42,626
the administrator
can actually request


1195
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:44,486
that these apps be
installed on this device.


1196
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:47,606
So because this device is
supervised, Chris can now send


1197
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:49,156
and request app install command


1198
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:52,056
and these applications just
start showing up on the device


1199
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:53,536
without me doing anything.


1200
00:55:54,516 --> 00:56:00,096le
[ Applause ]


1201
00:55:54,516 --> 00:56:00,096
[ Applause ]


1202
00:56:00,596 --> 00:56:01,726
So-- and that is the demo.


1203
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,256
Back to Todd.


1204
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:02,676
Thank you.


1205
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:04,116
>> Todd Fernandez: Thank
you very much guys.


1206
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:09,606
All right, well before I sum up,
I just wanted to point something


1207
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:12,296
around what Jussi said
about the ability of the--


1208
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:14,636
even if the user wipes
the device, it's enrolled


1209
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,536
in this new service, but
you're still going to have


1210
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:17,436
to go through it each time.


1211
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:18,456
You can't get around it.


1212
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:21,256
This actually makes for a
great experience in schools


1213
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,926
if a student graduates and
returns the device in school,


1214
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,146
all they need to do to prevent--
prepare it for the next student


1215
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,986
for the next year is wipe it
and hand it to the new student.


1216
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:32,646
All right, so what have we--
what have we talked about today?


1217
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:35,596
Well, we've added a huge
number of new capabilities


1218
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,446
to configuration profiles and
MDM protocol for all of you


1219
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,286
to adopt in your MDM solutions.


1220
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:43,566
We've made big changes


1221
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,176
to the App Store
Volume Purchased Program


1222
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:48,266
to add revocable app assignments
as well as book assignments.


1223
00:56:48,886 --> 00:56:52,406
We've created a brand new
service that you just saw


1224
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:55,706
to make it really easy for both
organizations and end users


1225
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,696
to get their devices enrolled,
remote device management.


1226
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:02,396
And I'm really looking forward
to working together with all


1227
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:04,716
of you to get these
systems integrated


1228
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,506
into your MDM products so that
we can make managing large


1229
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:09,186
numbers of Apple
devices a pleasure


1230
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:12,006
for both the organization
and each of their end users.


1231
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:14,786
Now I hope the next question
in your mind is, Todd,


1232
00:57:14,786 --> 00:57:15,916
when can we get started?


1233
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:19,346
Well, I have some good
news, the documentation


1234
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:20,666
which includes details on how


1235
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,456
to obtain your VPP Test
Accounts is available today.


1236
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:27,166
And the device enrollment
accounts will be ready


1237
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:28,426
next month.


1238
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:31,686
So with that, I will leave
you with the pointers


1239
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:35,206
to that documentation for
both the updated MDM protocol


1240
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:38,146
that covers both the new App
Store Volume Purchase Program


1241
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:39,796
as well as device
enrollment service,


1242
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,586
an updated configuration
profile reference


1243
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:44,246
that contains all
the new payloads


1244
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:47,426
and changes we've talked in the
first section and the new forum


1245
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:50,066
that you will hopefully
join to begin discussing how


1246
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,966
to integrate these best
into your products.


1247
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:54,986
As we've alluded during the
session, there are a number


1248
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:57,166
of sessions that will be
interest to app developers


1249
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,896
in particular who want to learn
more about how to take advantage


1250
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:03,276
of these new management
features in their apps including


1251
00:58:03,276 --> 00:58:05,606
that receipt session I
promised on Thursday afternoon.


1252
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:08,046
And with that, I will thank you
very much for your attention


1253
00:58:08,046 --> 00:58:09,406
and look forward to
seeing you in the lab.


1254
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,016
[Applause]


1255
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:15,866
