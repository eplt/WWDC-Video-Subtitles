00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,036
>> Good afternoon
everyone and welcome


4
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,286
to Architecting Performance
on watchOS 3.


5
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,006
My name is Tyler McAtee


6
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,476
and shortly you'll be meeting
my colleague, Todd Grooms.


7
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:39,996
Today we'll be discussing the
way we at Apple have thought


8
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:42,806
about performance and where that
took us when building watchOS 3.


9
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:47,156
We'll start by talking about
2-Second tasks, what that is,


10
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,456
how it helped influence
the design of watchOS 3,


11
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:51,366
and what that means for
your app's architecture.


12
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:55,166
I'll then talk a bit about how
design strategies influenced


13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,206
performance and, showcase
a new detail paging API


14
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,686
that will help reduce
unnecessary navigation time.


15
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:04,696
Finally, Todd will come on stage


16
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:06,856
and show how we've taken
these ideas and applied


17
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:08,726
to them the stock's
watch application.


18
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,436
So let's start with
2-Second tasks.


19
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:13,856
We've focused on this idea
as a good rule of thumb


20
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,276
for what an interaction with the
Apple Watch should feel like.


21
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:17,776
So what is a 2-Second task?


22
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,156
A 2-Second task is something
the user wants to accomplish


23
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,926
or learn by looking
at their Apple Watch.


24
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,786
These tasks should only
take a couple seconds.


25
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:29,926
And these seconds should be
measured from the very beginning


26
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,626
of the interaction
until the very end,


27
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,706
from the moment the user
raises their wrist to look


28
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,776
at their Apple Watch, to the
point where they've lowered it.


29
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:41,086
Some examples of a 2-Second task
may be, checking a notification,


30
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,526
setting a timer or
starting a workout.


31
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:46,076
Today I'm going to
walk through some


32
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:47,816
of the key changes
we've made to the system


33
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,726
and explain how these
will affect the way you


34
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,766
as a developer should
think about performance


35
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:52,936
in your WatchKit application.


36
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,516
Now, one of the first
bottlenecks


37
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,006
in accomplishing a task on
the Apple Watch is the amount


38
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,726
of navigation it can take to get
to the appropriate application.


39
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,046
The quickest way to
launch an application


40
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:06,226
on the Apple Watch is by
tapping a complication.


41
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:09,326
We only encourage developers
to implement a complication


42
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:10,895
if they had relevant
data to display.


43
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,626
A lot of our apps,
such as Messages,


44
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,496
Mail and Phone had
no complication.


45
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,796
In order to increase
navigatability


46
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:20,696
on the Apple Watch as well as
present users with more options


47
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:23,146
to customize, now
on watchOS 3 all


48
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:25,046
of our applications
have complications.


49
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:28,486
These launcher complications
are useful for quick access


50
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,256
to your very favorite
applications right


51
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:31,156
from the watch face.


52
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,176
We encourage you to
adopt this policy


53
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,486
for your application as well.


54
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:38,876
Implement a complication whether
or not you have data to display.


55
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,496
Additionally, new in watchOS
3 we've brought you the dock.


56
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,936
Just by pressing the side button
users will be able to bring


57
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,786
up their dock and
quickly look through all


58
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,036
of their favorites applications.


59
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,136
Navigating to and from these
applications is extremely quick


60
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:52,526
and easy.


61
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,006
Now we want our users
to be able to go


62
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:57,246
to these favorite applications
and have them already ready


63
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,866
and loaded, instead of having to
wait for an activity indicator


64
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:01,166
as the application
is brought up.


65
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:05,146
In order to address this, in
watchOS 3 all the applications


66
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:07,106
that a user chooses to
put on their watch face


67
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,506
or in their dock will be
kept alive and suspended


68
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:10,536
in memory by the system.


69
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:13,866
That way when they go to
interact with the applications,


70
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,316
they only have to wait for
resume, instead of a launch.


71
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,686
But the system still has
a fixed amount of memory,


72
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,586
and as an application
in the system,


73
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,176
you'll need to be
a good citizen.


74
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,486
Because there can be up
to 10 dock applications,


75
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,756
up to 5 complications, as well


76
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,826
as the system application,
processes and more.


77
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,486
You have to remember
that you're just one part


78
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:35,296
of a large ecosystem, so
you have to only use as much


79
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,006
as you absolutely need.


80
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,956
Now the system, because of
the nature of this ecosystem,


81
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,866
our system does impose a fixed
ceiling on the amount of memory


82
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,526
that a WatchKit application
can use.


83
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,046
If you exceed this limit,


84
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:49,696
our system will terminate you
abruptly with no chance to tear


85
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,386
down so that the memory can be
reclaimed for other processes.


86
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:56,256
This limit isn't a goal, and you
shouldn't feel the need to use


87
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,836
up all this memory
and realistically,


88
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:58,976
it should be nowhere
near the limit.


89
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:02,696
The current limit, as of watchOS
3 is 30 megabytes per WatchKit


90
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:04,716
application, but this
may change in the future.


91
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,966
So what are some good tips for
keeping your memory usage down?


92
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,306
Use appropriately sized
images for the watch screen,


93
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,586
not only does this
keep down memory usage


94
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,456
but will help increase
overall performance,


95
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,326
because the watch won't have


96
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,696
to do the extra work
to resize the images.


97
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:23,926
Use appropriately sized data
sets, don't download a giant set


98
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,786
of data if you're only
displaying a few records


99
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,236
on screen.


100
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,136
And if you're only displaying
one property of a data object,


101
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,126
don't download or keep


102
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:31,676
around all the other
properties as well.


103
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,936
If you have control over
the API you're using


104
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,896
to download the data
it may make sense


105
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:39,406
to build separate end points
for the phone and for the watch


106
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,906
since the watch will probably
display a more condensed version


107
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,706
of the information.


108
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,876
This will help save on the
amount of network traffic


109
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,916
that your watch has to
process as well as the amount


110
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,996
of transient data and memory.


111
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,756
Finally, it's important


112
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:53,156
to release objects
you're no longer using.


113
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:54,896
Take the time to go
through your code


114
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:55,926
and make sure you're
only keeping


115
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,466
around things you
absolutely need.


116
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,436
Now, because the applications
that a user chooses to put


117
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,776
on their watch face and
in the dock are kept alive


118
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,386
and suspended in
memory by the system,


119
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,136
they will be resumed much more
often than they're launched.


120
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,576
Because of this, for watchOS 3
the key path we want to focus


121
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:13,036
on optimizing is resume time.


122
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,826
Now apps won't only be
resumed more often just


123
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,316
because they're kept
alive in memory,


124
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,916
but also because
they're in the dock.


125
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,976
When the user scrolls over to
your application in the dock,


126
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:24,516
the application will be resumed.


127
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,706
When the user scrolls away, the
application will be suspended.


128
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:32,896
This behavior of resuming and
suspending often is now typical


129
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:34,406
for applications in watchOS 3.


130
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,446
So it's important to understand


131
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,526
which lifecycle methods
are a good place to do work


132
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,756
and which lifecycle methods
are not a good place.


133
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,626
So let's talk about the
different lifecycle methods


134
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,436
that the WatchKit
extension delegate will see.


135
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,576
ApplicationDidFinishLaunching
is the first method


136
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:50,526
that your delegate will see.


137
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,086
This gets called when the
application is first launched


138
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:55,596
and is a good place to perform
any final initialization


139
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,556
of your application
as well as any tasks


140
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,156
that only need to
be performed once.


141
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,886
The second method that
your delegate will see


142
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:04,076
is applicationDidBecomeActive.


143
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:07,616
This gets called whenever your
application becomes the active


144
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,136
application on the
platform, restart any tasks


145
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,126
that were previously paused or
not yet started, and if needed,


146
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,546
refresh the user interface.


147
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,886
Once the application
goes from the active


148
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,716
to the inactive state
you will get the


149
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,446
applicationWillResignActive
call.


150
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,596
This can occur for certain
types of temporary interruptions


151
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:26,836
such as an incoming phone
call or a notification


152
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,576
when the user presses the side
button to bring up the dock,


153
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,706
or when the user
exits your application


154
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:34,306
and it starts its transition
to the background state.


155
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,296
When your application is no
longer active and it starts


156
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:39,576
to go to the background
you'll get the


157
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:41,156
applicationDidEnterBackground
call.


158
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,666
And when your application
returns


159
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,986
to the foreground you'll get the
applicationWillEnterForeground


160
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:45,236
call.


161
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,376
These methods are only
called when you're going


162
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:50,446
from background to foreground or
from foreground to background,


163
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:51,836
so it won't be called
on first launch.


164
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,826
In addition, there are
lifecycle methods associated


165
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:56,866
with the interface controller.


166
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,306
AwakeWithContext gets called


167
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,396
when your interface
controller's first instantiated.


168
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,336
This is a good place to do work
that only needs to be done once.


169
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,906
willActivate is called when
the interface is active


170
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,056
and able to be updated.


171
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,686
It can be called before the
interface is actually visible


172
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,276
to the user.


173
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,696
Once the interface is
fully visible to the user,


174
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:15,906
you'll get the didAppear method.


175
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:17,806
If you have work
to do on resume,


176
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:19,636
these methods are the
good place to do it.


177
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,946
If the work is heavy
weight it may make sense


178
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,926
to dispatch the work out
to a background queue,


179
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,386
so that these methods
can complete


180
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,026
and your app can
finish resuming.


181
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,436
Once you're application's
getting suspended,


182
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,766
you'll get the willDisappear
call first


183
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,896
on your interface controller
when the user interface is


184
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:37,696
about to be no longer
visible to the user.


185
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,556
Once the user interface
is deactivated


186
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,226
and no longer be updated you'll
get the didDeactivate call.


187
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,826
These methods are a good place
to cancel any heavy weight tasks


188
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:49,476
that you may have started in
willActivate and didAppear.


189
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:54,746
It's important to understand
this lifecycle and understand


190
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,266
that these methods can get
called repeatedly and often.


191
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,136
I'd like to now walk
through an example


192
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,046
of how an application might
see these events during


193
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:02,646
its lifetime.


194
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,496
We'll start with an application
that, for the purposes


195
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,596
of this talk is not
running or backgrounded.


196
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:09,716
When the user taps
your application,


197
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:12,376
the first methods will go to
the WatchKit extension delegate,


198
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,516
didFinishLaunching,
and didBecomeActive.


199
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,716
The interface controller will
receive its awakeWithContext


200
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,136
willActivate and didAppear.


201
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:23,206
Now your application is running
foregrounded, and active.


202
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,536
But what happens when the
user presses the side button


203
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:26,396
to bring up the dock?


204
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:30,076
At this moment your application
is no longer the active


205
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,655
application on the platform,
that's the system application.


206
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,535
So your delegate will get the
applicationWillResignActive


207
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:35,785
call.


208
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,436
While the user's still settled
on your application however,


209
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,285
you'll still foreground
it in running,


210
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:43,666
you're getting CPU time,


211
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,066
your updating your user
interface, all that.


212
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,616
As soon as the user scrolls
away from your application,


213
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,516
the system will suspend
your application.


214
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:53,196
So your interface controller
will get the willDisappear


215
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,926
and didDeactivate
and you'll get your


216
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,446
application didEnterBackground.


217
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:01,436
Now here your application has
just entered a background state


218
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,816
so the system might
wake up your application


219
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,316
for a background snapshot task.


220
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:07,486
To learn more about
these snapshot tasks,


221
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,156
check out the talk
we gave this morning,


222
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,706
Keeping Your Watch
Apps Up to Date.


223
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:14,066
Your interface controller gets
woken up with willActivate


224
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,576
and didAppear, before your
delegates given the opportunity


225
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:17,876
to handleBackgroundTasks.


226
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,196
And then your interface
controller gets the


227
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,706
willDisappear and didDeactivate.


228
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,736
Now your application
is fully suspended


229
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,526
and it's handled its
background tasks.


230
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,776
Once the user swipes
back to your application,


231
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,906
you'll get your
applicationWillEnterForeground,


232
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:34,586
and your willActivate
and didAppear.


233
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:36,406
Your application is
once again running


234
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:37,846
and foregrounded in the dock.


235
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,636
It's no until the user taps
into your application though


236
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,786
that you become the active
application on the platform


237
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,686
and get
applicationDidBecomeActive.


238
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,806
Now a lot has happened just
from the user entering the dock,


239
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,366
swiping away from your
application, and swiping back.


240
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:54,076
That's why it's important to
be cognizant of this lifecycle


241
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,716
and understand that as a
user browses their dock your


242
00:09:56,716 --> 00:10:01,706
application may be seeing these
events repeatedly and often.


243
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,856
So what are some other tips
for reducing resume time?


244
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,276
You should use discretion when
updating WKInterface objects.


245
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,216
Every time you set a property


246
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:13,216
on WKInterface object the system
creates a message to send,


247
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,686
packs it up, and dispatches
it to the app process


248
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:16,766
where the UI is updated.


249
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,986
It may be tempting to build some
method that based on the state


250
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,646
of your application updates
your UI and then call


251
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:23,686
that every time you resume.


252
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,846
But setting each property
comes with a cost.


253
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,376
Even if the property isn't
changing this results


254
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:32,456
in unnecessary traffic between
the app and the extension.


255
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,476
It's worth the effort to
only set these properties


256
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:39,096
if they're changing, so
you absolutely need to.


257
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,096
You should also not


258
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:43,146
that WKInterfaceTable does not
behave the same as UITableView.


259
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:44,946
The phone has a lot more memory


260
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,486
for storing a lot
more information


261
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,416
and UITableView is just
optimized to quickly scroll


262
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,466
through these larger data set.


263
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:53,836
The cells are created on demand,
and are reused as you scroll.


264
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,396
With WKInterfaceTable however,


265
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:59,196
all the cells are created
upfront and there's no reuse.


266
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:00,776
So the amount of work
that your watch has


267
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,966
to do scales linearly
with the table size.


268
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:05,186
Because of that it's important


269
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,146
to keep WKInterfaceTable
size down.


270
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:09,776
The watch is not the appropriate
form factor to scroll


271
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:12,666
through hundreds of records and
in fact we found that it's best


272
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:17,876
to keep WKInterfaceTable
size to maybe just over 20.


273
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:20,536
You should avoid reloading
a WKInterfaceTable whenever


274
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:21,336
possible as well.


275
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,106
This is an expensive operation.


276
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,886
If it may be tempting to reload
your entire table on resume


277
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,336
or when your data set
changes, but if you need to add


278
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,506
and remove rows, it's better


279
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,636
to use the insertion
and deletion APIs.


280
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:38,096
I'd now like to talk
a bit about design.


281
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:40,666
Thinking about the right
information to display


282
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,876
on the watch form factor
as well as the best way


283
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,986
to display it can
greatly help performance.


284
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,786
In watchOS 3you should
design your applications


285
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:49,866
to be glanceable.


286
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,646
The dock lets users quickly look


287
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,106
through their favorite
applications.


288
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,586
So your application may
only be seen on screen


289
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,726
for a brief moment in
time as the user swipes


290
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,196
from one application
to the other.


291
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,326
So focus on showing only the
most essential information


292
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,006
and display it as
clearly as possible.


293
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,186
Part of making your application
more glanceable is designing it


294
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:12,266
with a focused purpose.


295
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,376
The watch is not the appropriate
form factor for scrolling


296
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:16,886
through large amounts
of content,


297
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,236
or looking at complex
data hierarchies.


298
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:22,426
By only showing the most
essential information,


299
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:24,436
you tend to get better
performance as a byproduct.


300
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,336
Since you're displaying less
data, you save on memory


301
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,416
and processing and need
fewer network calls


302
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,506
to stay up to date.


303
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,406
Lastly, it's important
to consider navigation.


304
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,876
I've talked a lot about how
we've improved navigation


305
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:39,036
on a system level, but
it's equally important


306
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:41,346
to consider navigation on an
application level as well.


307
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:45,636
In order to help with this
we're introducing a new detailed


308
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,266
pageing API.


309
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:51,736
A standard setup for a WatchKit
application is the hierarchal


310
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:55,446
data view where you have a
table of cells, and tapping one


311
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:57,306
of the cells drills into
detail about that item.


312
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,746
The problem with this
setup though is if you want


313
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,176
to see the detail
about a couple items,


314
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,576
you end up tapping
back and forth a lot.


315
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,606
In order to solve this, our new
detail paging API lets users


316
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:09,616
quickly scroll from
detail view to detail view,


317
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,286
just panning along the screen
or rotating the digital crown.


318
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,536
To learn more about how to set
up this API in your code as well


319
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:19,026
as learn about other quick
interaction techniques we've


320
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:20,436
released, for developers,


321
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,346
check out the Quick
Interaction Techniques


322
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:23,946
for watchOS talk
we gave yesterday.


323
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,666
But in this talk I'd like
to talk a little bit more


324
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,726
about the lifecycle that
view controllers will go


325
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,716
through as part of this API.


326
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:33,096
Because it's important from
a performance point of view.


327
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:37,506
So here we have our table with
3 cells, red, orange and yellow.


328
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:41,436
The detail paging API works
on segue from inner tables


329
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:42,476
to interface controllers.


330
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:44,826
So when you tap one of the cells
we're going to trigger a segue.


331
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,706
When you tap the cell,


332
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,616
your master interface
controller is going


333
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,096
to get the method
contextForSegue


334
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,266
withidentifierinTable row index.


335
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,856
This is where you're going to
build up the context object


336
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:56,936
that gets passed to your
detail view controller


337
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,346
and it's awakeWithContext
method.


338
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:01,376
Your master view controller
will not only receive its call


339
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:03,166
for the cell you
tapped, but each


340
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,536
and every cell in the table.


341
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,186
We prepare the context for every
detail view controller right


342
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,136
away so that when we
prepare the context for them


343
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:12,886
so that we can instantiate
them upfront.


344
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,016
That way when the user, goes


345
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,566
to their first one
they can quickly scroll


346
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,386
through all of them.


347
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,226
Your first controller
will be the,


348
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,456
first one to get its
awakeWithContext called on it


349
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,176
as well as its willActivate
and didAppear.


350
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,626
However, this is where
behavior is interesting


351
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:31,296
for the scroll view.


352
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,176
We'll preheat the
controllers close


353
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,726
to the selected detail
view controller,


354
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,346
so that the users can
scroll to the next one.


355
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:38,486
So the other colors are going


356
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,496
to get their lifecycle
methods called on them as well.


357
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,516
They're going to first get
their awakeWithContext,


358
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:47,526
and then their willActivate
and didDeactivate.


359
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:52,816
It's important to be smart
about setting up work


360
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:54,216
on these off screen
view controllers.


361
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,026
Don't start long CPU intensive
tasks on all of them blindly.


362
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:02,296
Because this may cause a lot
of work to spin up on the CPU


363
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,676
if you have a lot
of table cells.


364
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,156
Now as the user scrolls
from one detail view


365
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,176
to the other your previous
interface controller will be the


366
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,366
first to get its willDisappear
call, willActivate,


367
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,266
didDeactivate, and didAppear.


368
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,306
This keeps your interface
controllers


369
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,246
in a consistent state.


370
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,706
Those that are on screen
most recently have got their


371
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,026
didAppear call and those


372
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:23,236
that are off screen
most recently got their


373
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,176
didDeactivate call.


374
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,706
That way when you tap back to go


375
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:28,016
to the master interface
controller,


376
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:31,346
only one interface controller
needs lifecycle methods called


377
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:32,646
on it, the one that's visible.


378
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,336
It'll get its willDisappear,
and didDeactivate.


379
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:40,056
Alright, I'd like to
invite up Todd to talk


380
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,616
about how we've applied
these ideas


381
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,216
to our Stocks WatchKit
application.


382
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:43,906
Thank you.


383
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:50,500
[ Applause ]


384
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,396
>> Good afternoon.


385
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:01,746
I'm a watch OS engineer,
and we're presenting Stocks


386
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,116
as a case study to
WatchKit and developers.


387
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,546
So many of you may
not know this,


388
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,296
but Stocks is a watch
app built with WatchKit.


389
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,106
At Apple we wanted to
have firsthand experience


390
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:13,686
with WatchKit development,


391
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:16,386
and we felt that Stocks
would be a great use case


392
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:17,666
for WatchKit development.


393
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:22,566
I have three topics that I
would like to talk about today


394
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:24,786
in regard to Stocks and
WatchKit development.


395
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:29,246
I'm going to identify our
2-Second tasks for Stocks,


396
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,626
then I'm going to discuss some


397
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:34,976
of the implementation details
behind our background refresh


398
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:35,516
use cases.


399
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,996
Finally, I will talk a bit about
the optimizations we have made


400
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:45,446
to help with our resume time and
by extension, our launch time.


401
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,136
So, we'll begin with
our 2-Second tasks.


402
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,786
When we thought of Stocks,


403
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,676
we thought of three
important 2-Second tasks,


404
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,846
the first is you
most likely want


405
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,266
to view how a favorite
stock's current price is doing


406
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:03,696
right now.


407
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,816
This can of course
be accomplished


408
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,046
with a complication.


409
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,955
But with the dock, we're able
to get a little bit more detail


410
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:12,316
with that 2-Second task.


411
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,455
In particular, we felt


412
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:17,546
that another important 2-Second
task would be seeing your


413
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,896
favorite stock's current
performance throughout the day


414
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:21,586
in a chart.


415
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,945
Lastly, we felt that it
would be important for you


416
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,456
to see the current
price for a few stocks.


417
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,636
So we'll start with
the complication.


418
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:34,816
Now of course the
complication is the fastest way


419
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,036
to see data on your watch.


420
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,956
That data is always present and
it's there every time you go


421
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,556
to look at the time
on your watch.


422
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:48,876
The important piece in that, in
watchOS 3 is that data is kept


423
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,916
in sync between the
complication and the app.


424
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,916
Now for more information on
that, I would encourage you


425
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,676
to check out the Keeping Your
Watch App Up to Date session


426
00:17:58,976 --> 00:17:59,986
that occurred this morning.


427
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:04,336
So now we'll go and
talk about how some


428
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:07,796
of the other 2-Second tasks
were performed in watchOS 2.


429
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:12,386
So in watchOS 2, you
would launch Stocks


430
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,656
and you could see the
current price of the stock


431
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:17,916
that you were interested in or
the other stocks right away.


432
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,036
But if you wanted to see how


433
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:22,066
that stock had been
performing throughout the day,


434
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,926
you would need to
tap on a stock,


435
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,346
and now you're presented
with this view.


436
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:26,756
It's a little bit
more information,


437
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:29,236
but it still doesn't really
answer the question on how


438
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:31,906
that stock price had been
performing through the day.


439
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,636
So if you wanted to see that,
you would have to scroll


440
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,686
down a little bit, and
now you're on the chart.


441
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:41,216
We had four options, for the
chart, we have the day interval,


442
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,866
the one week, the one
month, and the six month.


443
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,296
So odds are the first
time that you scroll


444
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:48,816
down there you're probably
not even seeing the interval


445
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,696
that you care about which is
probably the one day interval.


446
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,876
So that would require you
tapping on those very,


447
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:58,156
very small buttons and
opening that chart.


448
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:01,796
And then after that, you would
have all this other metadata


449
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:06,076
down below that a lot of the
time isn't really necessary


450
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:08,366
for when you're glancing at
information throughout the day.


451
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,206
And of course if you wanted
to view multiple stocks


452
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,496
and how they're performing
throughout the day,


453
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:16,476
you would have to navigate
back, tap into the new one,


454
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,506
much like Tyler should you
in this animation earlier.


455
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,836
So let's look at watchOS 3.


456
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:25,766
Now here's the new watchOS
3 design, as you can see,


457
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,816
first of all, still a list
view that you come into.


458
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,746
But the font is much larger,
much more legible, a little bit


459
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:33,806
of a simplified interface.


460
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,916
To me it pops and it's easily
readable at small sizes


461
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:38,976
like you would see in the dock.


462
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,646
So if you wanted to see
how Apple was doing,


463
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,986
today and how the performance
was going you would tap


464
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:48,756
on Apple, again, but now you
see the chart right there.


465
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:50,906
And we just assume
that you always want


466
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:51,996
to see the one day chart.


467
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:55,366
There are instances of course,
where there isn't a day chart,


468
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,906
much like index funds
won't have a day chart.


469
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,476
But we can fall back to the
one month chart when we come


470
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:04,436
across those, and that's
the more relevant interval


471
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,626
that you would like
to see at a glance.


472
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:11,156
We also got rid of some of
the more minute detail below.


473
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,636
Now this gives us
two advantages.


474
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:17,356
One, it eliminates a
network request, which speeds


475
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,506
up our loading performance.


476
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:23,506
And two, it allows us to adopt
the new vertical detail pageing


477
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,086
API, so then that
way you can scroll


478
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:29,246
through multiple Stocks either
with a turn of the digital crown


479
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:30,766
or a swipe of your finger.


480
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:33,266
And of course, if you
want to view the details


481
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,906
of a stock's performance you
know like more minute details


482
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:40,126
that we had before such as the
52 week high or the 52 week low.


483
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:44,136
You can view that using
Handoff, so with Handoff,


484
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,666
you're able to setup a
context activity and then hand


485
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,656
that off to your iPhone.


486
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,386
So we feel that the watch is
the place for glanceable data,


487
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,376
and that the iPhone
is the place for,


488
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,896
you know like a view
that's data rich


489
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,536
or a little bit too convoluted.


490
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,566
So the good thing about the
new design, as I mentioned,


491
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:09,146
it's very readable in the
dock and with the dock,


492
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,786
we decided to reevaluate what
we would show there for Stocks.


493
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,636
So if you attended some of the
other sessions you're aware


494
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:19,046
that there is a concept of a
default state, and a snapshot.


495
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:23,166
So we took this to mean that
it should be a sticky view.


496
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,126
And what I mean by sticky is
that when you leave Stocks,


497
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,246
if you're looking at the
stock list, when you return


498
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,916
to Stocks either in the dock or
by going into the application,


499
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,686
you will see the stock list.


500
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,136
And this is also the
view that we'll keep


501
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:38,556
up to date throughout the day.


502
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:43,816
However, if you were to tap
into the details of a stock


503
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:47,046
and returned to look at
the, either the dock or go


504
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:49,876
into the app, then you're
going to see the detail view.


505
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:52,426
Now there's one caveat
with this,


506
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:56,196
so on Stocks you can set
your complication stock


507
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:58,106
and that's the stock
that you view,


508
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,316
of course on your complication.


509
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:00,466
So we took that to mean


510
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,116
that that's most likely
your favorite stock.


511
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:05,446
So once you set that,
that's the detail view


512
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:06,596
that we try to return you to.


513
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:10,786
So if you open up Stocks and
you say navigated from Apple


514
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,646
to the Facebook stock, and you
resumed back to the home screen,


515
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:19,436
in about an hour, when we get
the return to default state flag


516
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,306
for our snapshot, we will
actually take you back


517
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,176
to the Apple stock.


518
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,106
Because we take that to mean
that you had that selected


519
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,906
as your complication
stock and that


520
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,826
that would be your favorite
stock, and that's the one


521
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:30,926
that we want to return you to.


522
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,306
So we want to make a
predictable experience


523
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,086
and always return the user to
something that they would expect


524
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,826
to see after a certain
amount of time.


525
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,656
So let's recap what we've done


526
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:43,866
in our 2-Second tasks
for Stocks.


527
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:48,966
The first thing, we made sure
that we had consistent data


528
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:52,586
between our complication
and app.


529
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,866
The next, we simplified
our design,


530
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:58,046
we made it a lot more
legible at smaller sizes,


531
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:04,516
and much more usable
whenever you vertically scroll


532
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,626
through the detail pageing API.


533
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:10,616
And that lets you look at
multiple stocks, quickly instead


534
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:12,716
of having to do the
back and forth shuffle.


535
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,556
So next, we'll talk a little
bit about background refresh,


536
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:18,766
and I would like to
talk a little bit more


537
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,686
about how we implemented
background refresh in Stocks.


538
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:29,046
So when we started implementing
background refresh in Stocks,


539
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:30,826
we came up with two questions.


540
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:33,966
One, how often do we need


541
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,716
to update our information
in Stocks?


542
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:39,616
And two, what data
do we need to fetch


543
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:41,726
to keep our app up to date?


544
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:45,626
So determining how often
we should refresh our data


545
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,096
in Stocks was a little bit
of a tricky proposition.


546
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,816
At first we felt that updating
our data every 15 minutes was a


547
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:52,716
pretty good start.


548
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:57,326
This would leave us updating our
app many times throughout the


549
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,046
day, however.


550
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:03,496
And many of those updates could
occur when it's unhelpful,


551
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:05,836
like when the stock
market is closed at the end


552
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,706
of the day or over the weekend.


553
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,556
So let's take some
facts that we know


554
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:13,336
because we felt we
could be a bit smarter


555
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,476
in how we implemented this.


556
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,516
First, markets are
open for a period


557
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:17,476
of time throughout the day.


558
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,756
So for an example, let's
say we're following a stock


559
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:21,926
on the New York Stock Exchange,


560
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,716
and we know that the New
York Stock Exchange opens


561
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,326
at 9:30 a.m. Eastern and it
closes at 4 p.m. Eastern.


562
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:33,436
So if we limit our
background refresh request to,


563
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,346
basically when the market is
open, then we're able to cut


564
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:41,006
down our number of updates,
and it can sort of budget


565
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:42,426
for other applications.


566
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:46,096
And it's also going
to give us the benefit


567
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:50,756
of not updating our complication
and our application in times


568
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,716
when it would be ineffective.


569
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:57,776
So that's also nice as well.


570
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:01,996
So let's look at a little pseudo
code on how we would do that


571
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:04,146
and how would we decide
when the next refresh date


572
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:05,376
for Stocks should be.


573
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:09,216
First, we're going to enumerate
through their list of stocks,


574
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:14,796
then we're going to check and
see if the markets are like,


575
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,456
basically if the
markets are all closed.


576
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:18,266
Because if we know,


577
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:22,306
if the markets are all closed we
want the earliest next open time


578
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,406
that we have in our stock list.


579
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,006
Otherwise, that means at
least one market is open,


580
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,366
so we should fall back to our
regular 15 minute cadence.


581
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,736
So we'll look at a
little bit of source here.


582
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:35,346
The first thing that I'll
call your attention to,


583
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,226
this is just a function
that we would have in Stocks


584
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:38,896
for scheduling our
background refresh time,


585
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,066
and it takes an optional
preferred date.


586
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:46,156
We use the
scheduleBackgroundRefresh


587
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:49,976
instance method in WKExtension,
and we're going to pass


588
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:52,126
in this preferredDate here.


589
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:55,646
Now that preferred date is
calculated elsewhere in the app,


590
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:57,536
but that's at least how
we schedule our background


591
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:58,206
refresh time.


592
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:00,626
So I'm kind of working
backwards from the end result.


593
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:05,726
So let's see what happens in
our next preferred refresh data.


594
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:11,026
That function has a guard early
on, and so basically we're going


595
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:14,576
to call our function
earliestNextOpenDateInStocks.


596
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:20,196
And if it returns nil, then
we're going to go ahead


597
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:23,446
and bail, because in
earliestNextOpenDateInStocks,


598
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:24,986
we would return nil


599
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,106
if you didn't have any
stocks in your list.


600
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:28,676
Because at that point
there's no use


601
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:30,156
in doing a background refresh


602
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:31,596
because there's no
data to refresh.


603
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:36,946
So now we'll go ahead
and we'll calculate the


604
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:38,356
nextRegularRefreshData,


605
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,706
so that's just our update
cadence, so every 15 minutes.


606
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:44,586
And then finally, we'll
do this check here.


607
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:46,966
So we take that
earliestNextOpenDateInStocks,


608
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,396
and we'll do a later
date comparison


609
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,806
against our regular
refresh cadence.


610
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,426
Now our
earliestNextOpenDateInStocks


611
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:59,516
also has the added benefit
of returning distant past,


612
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:01,886
if the market is currently
open for any of our stocks.


613
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,936
So the later date would
always be the refresh cadence


614
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:06,776
in that scenario.


615
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:11,336
So let's look at that
earliestNextOpenDateInStocks


616
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:11,746
method.


617
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:14,666
First we're going to
grab our list of stocks


618
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:16,716
and then we're going to
do this guard check here.


619
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:21,236
And so if it's 0 again, we're
going to bail out, return nil,


620
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,766
there's no use in doing
background refreshes.


621
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:32,216
Then we're going to iterate
over our list of stocks.


622
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:37,636
If any of the markets, are open
then we're going to go ahead


623
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:38,736
and return the distantPast.


624
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,796
Otherwise we're going
to do this check here.


625
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:44,086
And we're just going to
basically iterate over the list


626
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:45,866
and find the
earliestNextOpenDate.


627
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,386
And so I mean, I just wanted
to show some of that code


628
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:52,046
because we feel that
that's a pretty good way


629
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,586
of limiting the number of times


630
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:55,046
that you're doing
background refresh,


631
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:59,866
with not a whole lot of code.


632
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:02,606
So let's talk about scheduling
multiple background requests.


633
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,706
Because in particularly with
Stocks, we have two end points


634
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:07,576
that we hit to keep our
application up to date.


635
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:12,036
So we have endpoint A, which
keeps the application data


636
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:13,896
up to date, and then
we have endpoint B,


637
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:15,316
for updating the complication.


638
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:21,316
So if we're going to schedule
our background refresh time,


639
00:28:21,786 --> 00:28:22,316
we do that.


640
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,376
Once we receive the
handle background task,


641
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:27,576
we'll submit our
endpoint A request,


642
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,176
submit our endpoint B request


643
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:31,426
and we'll schedule our future
background refresh time.


644
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:32,826
So what does that look like?


645
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,786
Well, we have our handle
background tasks method


646
00:28:35,856 --> 00:28:37,356
in our WKExtension delegate.


647
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,386
We're going to iterate over
those background tasks.


648
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,376
We're going to go ahead
and first check to see


649
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,916
if it's an application
refresh task.


650
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:49,056
And if it is, we're going
to go ahead and schedule


651
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,006
that data update request
and that's just going to be


652
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,726
where we actually
schedule our NSURL request.


653
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,466
The next we'll do,
we'll go ahead


654
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:58,436
and schedule our next
background refresh time,


655
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,826
using that handy dandy
nextPreferredRefreshDate.


656
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:03,946
And then we'll complete
our app refresh task.


657
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,166
The last part of this, I'll
call out to your attention is


658
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,096
that URL session
refresh background task.


659
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:10,436
Now you will get one of these


660
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:14,516
when you trigger a background
NSURL session request.


661
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,586
So it's our job here
to store that somewhere


662
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:20,156
where we can complete
it later whenever


663
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:23,126
that request is finished.


664
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:26,246
So now we've talked
about that let's talk


665
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:27,186
about what it actually looks


666
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,136
like when we schedule
those NS URL requests,


667
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:30,116
just at a high level.


668
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:33,806
So we're going to schedule
those requests, we're going to,


669
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,266
and then when those
requests are complete,


670
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,586
we're going to schedule
a snapshot,


671
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:39,356
reload the complication,
and we're going


672
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:42,106
to complete our refresh
background task.


673
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:46,036
So the first thing we'll
setup the app data request


674
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:47,516
and the complication
data request.


675
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:50,526
Then we're going to setup
our finish update handler.


676
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:54,326
Now the finish update handler is
just, for lack of a better term,


677
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:58,406
a block that I set so that
whenever the NS URL session


678
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:01,536
delegate method for finishing
the background request is


679
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,966
called, I can call that
finish update handler


680
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:08,636
and that'll call
what's in that block.


681
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:11,836
So then we have our
submitRequest


682
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:14,366
which is essentially just
taking the network request


683
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,486
and calling resume on the tasks.


684
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,316
Now once the task is complete,
we'll go ahead and grab


685
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:23,526
that task from our URL sessions
task which is just a dictionary.


686
00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:27,096
We'll schedule our snapshot,
we'll reload our complication,


687
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:32,896
and we'll go ahead and
complete that URL session task.


688
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,116
And one last thing
that I'll call


689
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:38,106
out here is our
urlSessionDidFinishEvents just


690
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:40,996
to show you that whenever
our requests finish,


691
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:45,876
we just grab the identifier
from the session configuration,


692
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:47,846
and we call our
finishUpdateHandler.


693
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,236
And so that kind of
gives you an idea


694
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,366
of how you can run multiple
requests to keep your app


695
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,936
up to date if you have
separate requests for your app


696
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:57,116
and your complication.


697
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,966
So the first thing,
obviously you want


698
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:01,916
to optimize how often
you schedule your updates


699
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,946
for your app when you're
doing background refreshes.


700
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:06,546
That's goal number one.


701
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:10,036
And if you're updating
with data from a server,


702
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:12,166
try to use a single
specialized endpoint


703
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,356
if you have control over that.


704
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:15,506
But if you don't, it is possible


705
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:18,476
to submit multiple requests
during a background refresh.


706
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:22,656
So now let's move onto
resume time optimizations.


707
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:25,936
So when you optimize your resume
time by extension you're going


708
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:27,256
to be optimizing
your launch time


709
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:29,186
as well, which is very nice.


710
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:32,856
So let's talk about
what we can do.


711
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:34,786
As Tyler I mentioned earlier,


712
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,616
we can minimize the work we're
doing during willActivate


713
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:39,526
and didAppear.


714
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:40,856
So you know to do that,


715
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:42,496
of course we avoid
long running tasks


716
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:43,756
that are triggered
from willActivate.


717
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,816
We'll do a smart loading
and reloading of our data,


718
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,966
and of course as he
mentioned before, we only want


719
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:50,956
to set properties on
our interface elements


720
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,086
that have actually changed.


721
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:55,416
So I'll start this off
with a cautionary tale,


722
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:59,006
and this involves implementing
the vertical detail paging API.


723
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:00,986
So as Tyler mentioned before,


724
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,156
neighboring detail pages
will have willActivate called


725
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,536
and you also want to
avoid expensive operations


726
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:08,476
in willActivate for
detail pages.


727
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:11,716
But in particular, there's one
very big expensive operation


728
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:12,336
in this view.


729
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:15,046
So it started with a
couple of bug reports


730
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:17,046
but essentially we got
reports of slow loading,


731
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:19,236
a slow loading chart for a stock


732
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:20,646
when you first entered
the detail page.


733
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,646
And other detail pages never
finish loading their charts,


734
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,256
or were extremely slow.


735
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:28,276
So we kind of looked at
the code, and tried to look


736
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:30,406
and see what was going on, so
this is a slimmed down version


737
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,706
of a stock interface controller.


738
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:33,356
But if you'll notice,


739
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:36,076
in willActivate we're calling
this downloadAndGenerateChart


740
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:41,076
which was, basically an NS
operation that was long running


741
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,906
and doing a lot of work to get
chart data and draw that chart.


742
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:47,006
So what can we do to
improve upon that?


743
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,376
Well, so we know that in
didAppear it gets called


744
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,626
when that interface
controller is actually visible


745
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:54,956
to the user and it has settled.


746
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:58,226
So how about we start
downloading and generating


747
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,306
that chart data there?


748
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,266
And then what happens
if you're scrolling


749
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:04,306
through those quite frequently?


750
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,896
We don't want to continue
downloading and generating


751
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:08,856
that chart data for a view
that you already left.


752
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:12,256
So we'll go ahead and we'll call
cancelDownloadAndGenerateChart,


753
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:13,546
which is just a method


754
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,946
that takes the operation
that's running and cancels it.


755
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:21,046
So, let's look at, again to
review some of these caveats,


756
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:23,236
because I have to learn
from my mistakes here.


757
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:26,996
We want to avoid triggering long
running tasks in willActivate.


758
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:32,136
And if possible, it's
great to make use


759
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:33,746
of cancellable operations,


760
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,546
so NS operation is a nice
template for doing that.


761
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:40,356
So we'll move onto the
WKInterfaceTable loading.


762
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:43,346
We know that all rows
are loaded in memory,


763
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:45,856
and we know that there's
a linear upfront cost


764
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,886
to the number of rows
you have in your table.


765
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:51,906
And, of course there's no reuse
as there is in UITableView.


766
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:54,976
So I'm going to show a graph and
this is some of the profiling


767
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:55,976
that I had done in Stocks.


768
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:59,606
And this for the initial
launch time, so after a reboot,


769
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,036
not resume time, any of that.


770
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:04,526
But it's kind of important to
note that when we had 0 stocks


771
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:05,956
in the list, so an
empty stock listed,


772
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:08,206
so just under 5 1/2
seconds to load.


773
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:11,585
If we added one stock it
jumped up a little bit,


774
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,755
to just under 6 1/2
seconds, and if add 5 stocks,


775
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,676
a little over 6 1/2 seconds.


776
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,295
And if we had 10
stocks, now it's starting


777
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,946
to creep up towards 7 seconds.


778
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:25,295
So if you have a
large number of rows


779
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:30,096
in your table you're just
basically delaying how quickly


780
00:34:30,356 --> 00:34:35,525
that interface controller
can load.


781
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,556
So what can we do to improve
our loading time here?


782
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,416
Well first we can limit the
number of rows that we load.


783
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:45,226
And we can also try to do
smart updates of our table


784
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,946
when row deltas occur so
meaning, when the list mutates.


785
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:50,466
So let's look at our initial
approach of loadTable.


786
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,806
We'll go ahead and we'll grab
the stocks from our manager,


787
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:57,366
and then we're going to set the
number of rows on the table.


788
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,896
And then after that,


789
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,856
we'll populate each row
controller with a stock.


790
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,846
Now it seems pretty harmless at
first, what's happening there?


791
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:09,746
Well the number of stocks isn't
capped, so if you had 20 stocks,


792
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:13,166
it would be 20 rows, if you had
30, 30 and so on and so forth.


793
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,676
And we were always using
a set number of rows.


794
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:20,806
And if just one row is being
added when use that number


795
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:22,876
of rows you're essentially
wiping


796
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:26,486
out what you had there before
and starting over again.


797
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:27,546
So it's inefficient.


798
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:29,716
So let's look at
what we could do


799
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,116
to be a little smarter
this time.


800
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,056
So we grab the stocks like
we did before, we'll go ahead


801
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,726
and check the count, and
we're going to go ahead


802
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:36,956
and cap that at a max size.


803
00:35:37,456 --> 00:35:38,786
So in Stocks' case, 20.


804
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:42,876
Then we're going to
calculate our row delta


805
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:45,076
to see what the difference
is, how much has it changed?


806
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,646
And then we're going to call
this insertRemoveTableRows,


807
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:48,706
which I'll get to in a second.


808
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:51,936
And then one last
button suspender approach


809
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,716
to make sure we're not doing
more work than we need to.


810
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,996
We'll go ahead and check to
make sure our index falls below


811
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:59,446
that max Stocks list size.


812
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:02,676
So let's look at that
insertRemoveTableRows.


813
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,126
So the first thing we're going


814
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:07,526
to do is calculate the row
change and then we're going


815
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:08,656
to check the stock row delta.


816
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,086
So if it's greater than 0,
we know we're inserting,


817
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:15,796
if it's less than 0, then we
know that we're going to remove.


818
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,806
And the important thing
here, I mean you can try


819
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,626
to be a little bit more
clever if you would like


820
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,996
and do smart updating based


821
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:22,956
on how much the list
has actually changed.


822
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:25,226
But we found, for
performance reasons,


823
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:29,666
just doing a simple insert
at index 0 or removing,


824
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:32,656
starting at index 0, seems
to serve us pretty well.


825
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:37,076
So let's not do more
work than we have to.


826
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:40,686
Alright so to recap,
the number of the stocks


827
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:42,796
in your stock list, or in
my case, the stock list,


828
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,486
in your case, I'm not sure
what you're putting in there,


829
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:47,006
but keep the number of
rows down and cap it


830
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,036
at something reasonable
for your use case.


831
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:54,376
Next, when you're inserting
and removing rows, that's going


832
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:57,176
to be much more efficient than
if just calling the set number


833
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,526
of rows method on
WKInterfaceTable.


834
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:04,606
So one last thing here,
instead of iterating


835
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:08,096
over the entire table when
single row updates are coming.


836
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,326
So think about it this way,


837
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,426
like what if we're updating
the Apple stock price


838
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,986
in our table list or
our list of stocks?


839
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:18,916
Instead of going through and
updating each one of those rows


840
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,226
when we don't have to, we can
make use of the rowController


841
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:24,456
at index so that way we only
update the rowController


842
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:25,236
that we care about.


843
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:30,086
Or, you can even do something
similar to storing a reference


844
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:32,326
to that rowController
and updating it later.


845
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:36,136
So now we're going
to talk a little bit


846
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:37,566
about updating your UIElements.


847
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:42,486
So as Tyler mentioned before,
these UIObjects and WatchKit,


848
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:44,886
they're modified in
the extension process,


849
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:46,896
and updates to these
properties are sent


850
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:49,076
from the extension
process to the app process.


851
00:37:49,756 --> 00:37:52,596
And the app process handles
layout of the interface.


852
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:54,846
So let's look at
our UI for Stocks,


853
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:56,256
and this is just
a rowController.


854
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:58,316
But we have the platter
here, which is a group


855
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,926
which has just the
tappable area for the row.


856
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,446
Then we also have the list name


857
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:04,936
and so that's just
the ticker symbol


858
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,806
of the company name,
that's a label.


859
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:08,806
The change in points label,


860
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,656
and that's just the
change that we've had.


861
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:13,746
And then we have the price
label, current price.


862
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,886
So let's look and see
what we're doing there.


863
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,096
When we would go to
update this rowController,


864
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:19,236
we had this update method


865
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,266
and it would just take
whatever values we gave it


866
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,096
and it would set those
properties right away.


867
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:27,976
Now that's bad because
properties


868
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:31,606
on the interface object
are not cached, right.


869
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,366
And setting a property on
that object sends that value


870
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:39,136
to the app process every time,
and I'm redundant on this


871
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:42,276
but I want to emphasize
the importance of that.


872
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:45,866
On average, in my profiling


873
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,526
in Stocks it would take roughly
200 milliseconds for a value


874
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:52,526
to move from the extension
process to the app process.


875
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:56,186
And that doesn't really
seem like a long time, but,


876
00:38:57,256 --> 00:39:01,326
in some profiling, that I
did for the initial launch,


877
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:05,496
I saw a pretty staggering
number of on average,


878
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:08,226
a worst case scenario
1.4 seconds for some


879
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:09,476
of those messages to get sent


880
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:12,296
over from the extension
process to the app process.


881
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:16,286
So it's a big difference.


882
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:18,306
So what can we do to
be a little smarter?


883
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,866
Really just cache those values
that you've already sent over


884
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:26,936
and then only send them
if they've changed.


885
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,726
So let's do a little recap of
our resume time discussion.


886
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:33,036
We want to minimize the work
performed in our willActivate


887
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,546
and our didAppear, and
we'll want to make use


888
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,956
of cancelable operations
whenever possible.


889
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:39,736
It's also important to note,


890
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:42,676
that overly complicated user
interfaces, they're going


891
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:43,836
to lead to slower load times.


892
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,476
So the more data that you're
having to pull through


893
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:48,826
and update on the UI,
the slower it can be.


894
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:52,456
And of course, we'll only want
to update our user interface


895
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,596
when necessary, so only
when things change.


896
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:59,256
So to summarize the Stocks
case study and what I would


897
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:01,736
like for you to take from
this, think small in your apps.


898
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,016
Keep your tasks small
and easy to perform.


899
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,526
You'll want to simplify your
user interface and you want


900
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:13,706
to make use of the new
background refresh APIs.


901
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:16,826
Focus on resume time in your
apps, we want to pay attention


902
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:19,166
to the WKInterfaceController
lifecycle methods,


903
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:20,936
especially willActivate
and didAppear.


904
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,386
And make use of our cancelable
operations when possible,


905
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,776
and optimize when updating
your user interface


906
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,376
by not sending redundant
information.


907
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:33,456
For more information, you can
view the developer website.


908
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,096
Our session number is 227.


909
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:36,996
Some of the related sessions,


910
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:38,466
unfortunately have
already happened,


911
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,926
but some of these I
feel are important


912
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:44,596
to not only WatchKit development
but, we have concurrent program


913
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:48,576
on GCD in Swift 3, so that's
also important as well.


914
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:51,646
So thank you and have a
wonderful rest of the week.
