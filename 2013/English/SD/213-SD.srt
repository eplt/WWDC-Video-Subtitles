00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:11,976
>> Chris Dreessen:
Good afternoon.


3
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:16,286
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:18,166
Welcome to session 213.


5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,196
This is best practices
for Cocoa Animation.


6
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:21,486
I'm Chris Dreessen.


7
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,996
I'm an AppKit Engineer
so I work on this stuff.


8
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:26,956
We have a lot of great things
we'd like to show you here.


9
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:30,126
So I'm going to give you
a basic overview of this.


10
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:33,086
So I said a lot of great things,
I meant a lot of great things.


11
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,706
I'm going to start with a
brief overview of how Animation


12
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:38,056
in Cocoa works, how to use it.


13
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,616
We're going to continue
to describe how


14
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:42,356
to make your own view
subclasses animatable


15
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:45,006
for your own properties
and describe how to augment


16
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,076
that with context
sensitive animations.


17
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,546
I'm going to share
with you a technique I


18
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,806
like to call chaining animations
where we use the completion


19
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,776
of one animation to start
off another animation.


20
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,826
Some of you are familiar


21
00:00:57,826 --> 00:00:59,956
with the implicit
animation functionality


22
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,286
of NSAnimation Contest
we added in 10.8


23
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:04,146
and I'm going to cover that.


24
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:05,996
And then I'm going to cover
a bit of Core Animation,


25
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,906
not how you can use
Core Animation


26
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,616
but rather how NSView
uses Core Animation


27
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,286
to do animations
for layer back use.


28
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:13,756
At that point I'm going


29
00:01:13,756 --> 00:01:17,346
to invite my colleague Peter
Amman onstage and he's going


30
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,516
to talk about this great new
class called NSStackView.


31
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:22,326
He's going to describe how
you can use auto layout


32
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:23,416
to animate view positions,


33
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,976
how you can animate those
constraints directly


34
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:27,676
and additionally best practices


35
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:29,596
for animating window
size changes.


36
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:33,586
So throughout the course of
this presentation I'm going


37
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:36,186
to be talking a lot about
the NSAnimatableProperty


38
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:39,786
ContainerProtocol and that lives
in the NSAnimimation.h header.


39
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:42,796
And it's a simple protocol, it's
just five methods but I'm going


40
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:43,916
to be coming back here a lot


41
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,496
and we'll touch each
of these one by one.


42
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,986
So basic animations, most of
you are familiar with this


43
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,916
but this is how you animate
basic things for NSView.


44
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,736
So back to NSAnimatableProperty
Container,


45
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,196
I said we'd be coming
back here a lot.


46
00:01:57,196 --> 00:01:57,636
I didn't lie.


47
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,336
The method I want to introduce


48
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:02,436
to you here is the animator
method which returns


49
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,296
to you the thing we
call the animator proxy.


50
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,586
And this is an object that
implements all the same methods


51
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:08,666
that your object does.


52
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,836
The difference is when you
message it it will animate them


53
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,586
instead of just popping
to the final location.


54
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,886
So suppose you want to
fade the Alpha of a view.


55
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,806
You want this to disappear?


56
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,736
Well that's not too bad,
that's just one line of code.


57
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,956
We set the Alpha value to zero
through the animator proxy,


58
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:26,636
view.animator.alphavalue=0
and that's all it takes.


59
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,116
And here's something
more complicated.


60
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,146
This is, we're sliding, that's
got to be way more code, right?


61
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:37,536
Same thing,
view.animator.frameorigin,


62
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:38,886
just one line of code again.


63
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,636
Okay here's one more,
we resized it.


64
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:43,626
That's two dimensions.


65
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:45,416
That's got to be
four times the work


66
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,906
and it is four times the work.


67
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:49,876
It's also one line of code.


68
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,316
[laughter] Alright so you're
all familiar with that.


69
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:56,246
I want to talk about how to make
your own views animatable now.


70
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:59,546
So suppose you want to do
an animation like this.


71
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:03,476
We have a framed view which is
a single red line on the outside


72
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,566
and we change the line
thickness, we grow it.


73
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,426
So your view might
look like this.


74
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,486
You're going to declare a
line thickness property,


75
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:10,456
it's a float.


76
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,476
And you're going to
go in and drawRect


77
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,696
and this is a simple drawRect.


78
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:17,286
We just set the red color and
then we frame our own bounds


79
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,996
with a rectangle of the
appropriate line thickness.


80
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,456
And additionally in our accessor


81
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:25,656
for setLineThickness we
call setNeedsDisplay yes,


82
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,436
after we've updated our I-bar.


83
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:30,226
So I told you, you know, you
can just use the animator proxy,


84
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,286
that works fantastically.


85
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:34,526
And if we try this we
see this animation.


86
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:38,436
And technically that
was an animation.


87
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,906
Things changed on screen.


88
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,916
But I don't think any of
us are really satisfied


89
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:42,696
with that animation.


90
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,096
So what was missing?


91
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:48,116
Well back to the NS Animatable
Property Container Protocol.


92
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,816
There is this method called
defaultAnimationForKey.


93
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:52,256
It's a class method.


94
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,856
And that is our missing
piece here.


95
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,766
And to make this animatable
we're going to go ahead


96
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,956
and implement the
defaultAnimationForKey method.


97
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,466
So our implementation we start


98
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,766
by checking what key we're
actually talking about here.


99
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,836
In this case it's our
line thickness property


100
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:07,436
which is great.


101
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:11,706
And we return the default
CABasicAnimationObject


102
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,366
and CABasicAnimation is one


103
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,426
of the animation types
we use most frequently.


104
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:19,766
It just has very simple
from and to values along


105
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:20,495
with some properties


106
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,666
that control how those
values are interpolated.


107
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:26,286
And of course if it's not the
line thickness property we want


108
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,186
to fall through as a super


109
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,716
so the other view properties
can continue being animatable.


110
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:33,606
And just by adding that if we
do view.animator.linethickness


111
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,456
again we get this animation
which is just what we wanted.


112
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,526
So that's still pretty simple


113
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:43,426
so let's complicate
things a little bit.


114
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,556
Sometimes you need to
know more information


115
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,926
that you can provide
in a class method.


116
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:49,036
You need to know what
specifically is being animated.


117
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,416
And you can do that too with MS
Animatable Property Container.


118
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,176
There is a method
called setAnimations


119
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,176
which takes a dictionary,


120
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,626
the keys in the dictionary
are the properties


121
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,486
that are being changed
and the values


122
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:03,056
in the dictionary are
CAAnimationObjects describing


123
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,306
how you want us to change them.


124
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,746
So this is our method here
and suppose we wanted to snap


125
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,116
to multiples of 10
for our line thickness


126
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,386
as we did our animation.


127
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,326
We can't really do this here.


128
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:16,386
There's no way of specifying.


129
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,526
We don't know what the from
and to values are inside


130
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,556
of the class
defaultAnimationForKeyMethod.


131
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:24,166
So the way we fix
that is we're going


132
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,906
to use this thing called
CAKeyframeAnimation


133
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,706
and the key frame animation is
another animation type we use


134
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:29,146
a lot.


135
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:32,576
And in it you can, well
basically you specify values


136
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:34,616
to the key frames and you
can interpolate between those


137
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:37,126
or just have it use
those discreet values


138
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,006
at different time stamps.


139
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,786
And in this case we're going to
populate it with steps from 0


140
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,886
to 40 moving by 10 each time.


141
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:49,776
So once we create our animation
we turn it into a dictionary


142
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:52,006
and we set it on the
view.animationsproperty


143
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,046
and that's our new objective
C dictionary syntax there.


144
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,676
We specify the key
as line fitness.


145
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,096
The value is our
key frame animation.


146
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,586
And then we just talk to the
animator like we always did.


147
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:04,396
View.animator.linefitness=40
and we wind up with an animation


148
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,716
that looks like this instead,
which is exactly what we wanted.


149
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,816
So that's kind of cool.


150
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,786
But there's a few
other things you can do


151
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,336
with key frame animations
that are neat.


152
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:17,246
And I mentioned you could, you
know you have your key points


153
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,766
in there that have
specific values.


154
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,306
You don't need to interpolate
between those values.


155
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,336
And in fact with some types
of values you can interpolate.


156
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,926
So in this example I'm setting
these values to an array


157
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:31,296
of images of various Apple
products and the same as before,


158
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,346
I set the animations dictionary
there using our new animation


159
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,446
for the image property, in
this case this could be the an


160
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,316
NSImageView which
implements an image property.


161
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:41,186
And I just tell the animator
hey, change the image


162
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,096
to this final Apple TV image.


163
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,436
And something I want
to point out,


164
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:47,786
my key frame animation
specified five different types


165
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,976
of Apple products but it
didn't specify Apple TV.


166
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:51,506
And the reason for this is


167
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:54,946
that the value you tell your
animator proxy is the value


168
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,106
that's going to wind up
in the object ultimately.


169
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,746
The stuff in the animation
is just used along the way.


170
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:04,156
So if we see what this
looks like, recycling nicely


171
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,876
through the Apple
products in our image well,


172
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,246
and we end at Apple TV.


173
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,046
And you can do this
with other things.


174
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,026
You don't need to do
it with just images.


175
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,636
You can do it with string
values, for example.


176
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,856
In this case we have
a text field.


177
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,386
Our values are various
city names.


178
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,146
And again, if we set the
animations dictionary


179
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:22,376
on our text field using string
value this time as the key


180
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,366
and our key frame
animation again as the value,


181
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,286
and finally we tell
the animator,


182
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:29,296
hey your string value is San
Francisco because we want


183
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:31,156
to wind up in San
Francisco and all


184
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:33,366
of you here have already
completed the step, good job.


185
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,506
So we see what that looks like.


186
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,816
It animates our text field
just like we expected.


187
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,466
But you can do a
few more things.


188
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,146
You don't need to
restrict yourself


189
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:43,146
to key frame animations.


190
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:47,066
So if you're familiar
with NSCell and NSControl,


191
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,096
especially NSTextField,
you're familiar


192
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,706
with these things
we call formatters.


193
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,436
And formatters are objects which
take an arbitrary object type


194
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,316
and return a human
readable string value.


195
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,346
And in this case I'm going


196
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,766
to implement my own
formatter class,


197
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:03,596
in this case the cleverly named
my formatter but we're going


198
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,896
to delegate most of our
actual formatting work


199
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:06,826
to NSDateFormatter.


200
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:10,356
So our string for object
value method looks like this,


201
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,556
we take in an NS number and we
just ask for its double value.


202
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:16,276
And one of the ways we
represent dates on our system is


203
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,906
as the number of seconds
since January 1, 2001,


204
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,546
that's the reference dater,
in this case the time interval


205
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:22,626
since the reference date.


206
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,256
And we can construct a new date


207
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,996
from that double value
representing the number


208
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:27,426
of seconds.


209
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,926
And then we just plug
this into our NSFormatter


210
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,976
and it gives us a nice human
readable string for the date.


211
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:35,285
And we couple that
with this code.


212
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,186
We go ahead, and I want this to
be a long, slow animation for us


213
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,056
to savor so it could
take 20 seconds.


214
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,556
And here I'm replacing
the animations dictionary


215
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,596
on the text field again,


216
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:45,616
this time for the
double value property.


217
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,396
Double value is a property most


218
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,166
of our controls themselves
implement,


219
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,666
and again it's a double so
it's easily interpolatable


220
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,076
using CABasicAnimation.


221
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,116
I set the text field's double
value to the initial value of 0


222
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,786
and then I ramp it
up to 1,000,000.


223
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:02,146
And when you do this
you get this animation.


224
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,186
We are actually formatting
the interpolated values


225
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:10,116
for every second between January
1, 2001 and wherever this ends.


226
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:13,316
So you can also use
this for other things,


227
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,426
for example you can implement
your own double property


228
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:18,026
that we can interpolate because
it's a double and say ramp it


229
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,426
between 0 and 1 and then
use that as the input


230
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,036
to your own calculation to do a
more complicated interpolation.


231
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,006
And yes, I love you
so much I dug


232
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:28,136
up the old Chicago font
for that animation.


233
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:34,606
[applause] So we're going to get


234
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,826
into something I call chaining
animations now which is simple


235
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,926
but can look complicated.


236
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:43,726
Don't be daunted by this
next slide, that one.


237
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,066
You can be daunted by
this slide, that's okay.


238
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,016
So in this case we just
have a few animation groups.


239
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,796
So we have our first
animation group


240
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:52,756
and we're setting
properties for our first view.


241
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:55,166
And then the completion handler


242
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,786
of that animation group
contains another animation group


243
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,666
and we set properties
for our second view,


244
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,406
likewise the completion handler


245
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:04,346
for that group contains
another animation group


246
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,766
and we're just setting
properties for view three here


247
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:10,166
so you can see here's the 3rd
animation group encapsulated


248
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,996
within the second
animation group, encapsulated


249
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,456
within the 1st animation group.


250
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:18,986
So I'm going to go ahead
and show you a demo


251
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:23,966
of how you can use
this in your own code.


252
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,316
So let me show you what
this program is here.


253
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:32,496
This is just a simple
list of fonts on the left


254
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,886
and a rotated shadowed preview
of that font on the right


255
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,676
and we can actually select
multiple ones of these


256
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,816
and we get this sort
of page fanning effect.


257
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:43,186
And if you've used mail and you
select multiple messages you


258
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,606
notice they do a
very similar effect.


259
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,326
One of the differences though is


260
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,816
that mail actually slides these
messages in from left to right


261
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,626
and then right to left
as they come in and out.


262
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,156
And additionally it implements
this really cool effect


263
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,376
where they slide
in one at a time.


264
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,826
So I'm going to show you how
we can take this program here


265
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,166
and implement all of that.


266
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:06,416
So the important methods to be
aware of are these three here,


267
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,136
update visible views,


268
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:13,896
our controller object here
has two NSIndexSet I-bars


269
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:16,306
and an index set is
basically just an array


270
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,126
of specific indexes but you
can perform set operations


271
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:21,116
like union, interception,
subtraction on them.


272
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:25,536
And one of these index sets
stores the rows or fonts


273
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:29,276
that we want to be visible
and another stores the ones


274
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,406
that actually are visible.


275
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:35,056
So to calculate the ones we
want to remove we take the ones


276
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:37,446
that are actually visible and
we subtract the ones we want


277
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,296
to be visible and the remainder
there is what we need to take


278
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,116
out of the view hierarchy.


279
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,206
Similarly when we want to bring
stuff in we take what we want


280
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,626
to be visible and we subtract
what's actually visible


281
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:47,946
and that tells us
what we need to add.


282
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,646
So then we just enumerate
over these index sets.


283
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,656
And we hide the rows
that shouldn't be there


284
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,216
and we add the rows
that are there.


285
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,516
And if we go ahead and
look at the implementations


286
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,946
of these methods,
here's the hide method,


287
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,986
we just have an early out in
case it's already visible.


288
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,906
We update our I-bar.


289
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:04,616
We grab a cache view for the
appropriate font and we take it


290
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:07,566
out of our view hierarchy.


291
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:11,806
The show method is a little more
tricky but it's not that bad,


292
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,926
same thing, early out, update
our I-bar, grab the view


293
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,566
and here we position it within
our right side container


294
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,706
and we just center it.


295
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:20,666
So what we want to do


296
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,556
for animation though is
complicate this up a bit.


297
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,466
We want it to slide
in left to right.


298
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,096
So just setting the final
bounds isn't enough.


299
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,056
We actually need
two new variables.


300
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:36,046
We need one to specify the
origin of view of the view


301
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,166
when it's on screen and
that's actually the same


302
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:40,846
as the value we've
already computed


303
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,926
so we can take what we
set the view frame origin


304
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,366
and we just assign
it to this sort


305
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,686
of temporary in origin value.


306
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:49,326
And then we need another one
which says what the origin


307
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:51,576
of the view should be when
it's off screen or our


308
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,676
out origin in this case.


309
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,446
And when it's off screen we
want the right edge of our view


310
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:58,686
to match the left edge of the
container view so we're going


311
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:00,436
to take the MidX of the
container view instead


312
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,226
and instead of subtracting
1/2 of our width we're going


313
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,106
to subtract our whole width


314
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,916
and that aligns our
edges like we'd expect.


315
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,086
We don't need this bit anymore.


316
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,936
So one of the things we can do
now though is we're going to,


317
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,356
this will look familiar
if you're paying attention


318
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,956
to the slides, we're going
to make a CABasicAnimation


319
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,976
and we're going to set
its from and to values.


320
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:39,816
We're going to start at the
out origin and we're going


321
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,486
to animate to the in origin.


322
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,236
And it's important
to remember our steps


323
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,846
of setting the animations
dictionary on the view


324
00:13:51,106 --> 00:14:00,946
so view.animations=frameorigin,
with our animation there.


325
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:03,526
And then we tell
the animator again,


326
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:04,856
hey we want to animate in.


327
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:19,006
And we actually want to add
our subview before we do that.


328
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:22,496
So similarly for
removing this we're going


329
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,896
to do a very similar
thing, we're also going


330
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,786
to specify an animation
for how to remove it.


331
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,276
So we actually copy and
paste a whole lot of this.


332
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,466
So we copy and paste our
container bounds, our view frame


333
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,546
and our from and to values.


334
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,886
But in this case we need
our from and to values


335
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:37,936
to be switched so
that's an easy fix.


336
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:43,466
And additionally our use of the
animator is also very similar


337
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,016
so we can take that
again as well.


338
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,676
Importantly we're replacing
animating to the in origin


339
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:49,886
with animating to the out origin


340
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,576
but we have one remaining
problem here.


341
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:53,546
You'll notice before we
remove from the super view


342
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,316
if we did this immediately we
would tell our view to animate


343
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,336
and before it ever had a chance
to draw we would remove it.


344
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:00,266
So we're going to go ahead


345
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,326
and open animation group
using NSAnimationContext run


346
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:05,046
animation group.


347
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:08,906
We're going to take our changes
that kick off the animation


348
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,186
and move them into
the changes block.


349
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:12,736
We're going to take
the completion handler


350
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:17,686
and we're going to take our
removeFromSuperview from this.


351
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:18,976
And this prevents our view


352
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,926
from being prematurely removed
before animations had a chance


353
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:22,286
to run.


354
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,336
So if we go ahead and run
this and we cross our fingers


355
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:30,956
that it compiles, yay,
we get this instead.


356
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:34,846
And you can see these things
nicely exchanging locations come


357
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,266
in from the left and
exiting to the left.


358
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,356
And that works, we
bring multiple things,


359
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,676
or bring them out,
so that's great.


360
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:44,006
But one of the differences
here is these all fly


361
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:44,916
in at the same time.


362
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,096
We want them to come in one at
a time so how can we do that?


363
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:51,946
Well if we go back to our update
visible rows method I'm going


364
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:54,776
to go ahead and declare some
block scope storage here


365
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,476
and just keep an integer that
keeps track of the number


366
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:59,036
of animations we've
added in this pass.


367
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,976
So I'm going to begin an
animation group again.


368
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:13,316
And I'm going to copy and paste
our code that enumerates our


369
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,726
in and out index sets.


370
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,076
And one of the differences
though is I only want


371
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,566
to remove or add a single view.


372
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,346
So I'm going to go ahead


373
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,956
and enter increment my counter
inside of my enumeration


374
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:28,206
and the enumeration method
has this handy stop argument


375
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:31,956
that I can set to yes to exit
early and I'm going to set


376
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,996
that to yes if our count has
been something other than 0,


377
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,306
which it will always
be in this case.


378
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:39,116
I'm going to make the same
change for adding a view


379
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,736
but instead of always
enumerating the views


380
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:46,666
to add I'm only going to do it
if we haven't removed anything


381
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,246
so we're only going to get
one removal or one addition


382
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:53,756
for pass through this.


383
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:58,476
Now if we didn't add
anything this time, excuse me,


384
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:01,266
if we did add something
or remove something


385
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,945
after our animation has
completed, we want to go ahead


386
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,346
and just run this another time


387
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,935
so we call self-update
visible views


388
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:16,256
and of course we add a semicolon
here to appease the gods.


389
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:18,925
So we still have
our nice animation.


390
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:22,036
But you'll notice as I bring
these things in they come in one


391
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,675
at a time just like they do
in mail and they exit one


392
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,955
at a time just like
they do in mail


393
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:27,766
and that's exactly
what we're looking for.


394
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:28,886
It wasn't as complicated


395
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:32,066
as having 10 animation groups
stuck inside each other.


396
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:34,526
It was just the act of
invoking our single method


397
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:37,516
from the completion handler
that we had already kicked off.


398
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:41,566
So that's how you can
use animation chaining


399
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,256
to implement some fairly
entertaining animations.


400
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:51,686
That concludes our demo
for chaining animations.


401
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,846
So on to the next thing,
implicit animation.


402
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:55,906
This is something we
added in Mac OS 10.8.


403
00:17:57,026 --> 00:18:01,226
And some of you have probably
already used it and enjoyed it


404
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:02,816
and or have been
terrified have it.


405
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:07,116
So before we added this you
would use view.animator.frame


406
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,246
and you would just set
it to a new rectangle


407
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:12,566
and with implicit animation
you could use this instead.


408
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,746
You tell the current animation
context that it's okay


409
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:15,966
to allow implicit animation


410
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:18,246
and then you set the frame
on the view directly.


411
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,936
So you're actually
animating as a side effect


412
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:24,996
of setting the properties
on your view.


413
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:28,476
So consider this method here
called swapSubviewFrames.


414
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:31,486
In this we just take
our first two subviews,


415
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:35,956
we grab their frame rectangles
and we set subview 0's frame


416
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:38,086
to subviews 1 frame
and vice versa.


417
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:43,656
And if we just execute
this we get this,


418
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,326
they just swap positions,
which is correct


419
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,716
but it's not necessarily
what we want.


420
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,486
You can do this with allowances
in animation really easily,


421
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,736
we just setanimation context.


422
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:53,466
currentcontext.


423
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,436
allows implicitaniimaton=guest


424
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,556
and we execute our
same method as before.


425
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,456
And in this case
it looks like this.


426
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,506
So when would you use this?


427
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,256
You would use this in places


428
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,416
where the animator proxy
doesn't have visibility


429
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,536
into what's being animated.


430
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,046
You'll notice swap subview
frames was an action.


431
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,336
It didn't take an argument.


432
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,576
The animator can't actually
interpolate anything in there


433
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:15,516
so you can use the
animation context


434
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:19,736
AllowsImplicitAnimationProperty
to animate those frames


435
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,246
as a side effect of
your action method.


436
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,376
There are some caveats.


437
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:25,986
First it doesn't
work for everything.


438
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:29,406
It will work reliably for frame,
frame size and frame origin,


439
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,426
pass that you're
beginning to pray.


440
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,156
But it does tend to
work for more things


441
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,566
when you're layer backed and
we're talk a little bit more


442
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,196
about layer backing in a bit.


443
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:41,056
In fact we'll talk a bit more
about layer backing right now.


444
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,446
So I'm going to give a brief
overview of core animation,


445
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,166
a very brief overview
of core animation here.


446
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,346
And you're probably already
familiar with CALayer.


447
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,996
And this is an object
that contains lots


448
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:55,686
of properties very similar
to MSView, it has like bounds


449
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:57,006
and position and opacity.


450
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,236
And these are all properties


451
00:19:58,236 --> 00:19:59,796
that Core Animation
knows how to animate.


452
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,266
And if you want to use
explicit animation you want


453
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,846
to tell core animation
to animate this,


454
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:07,136
you don't modify the
property, you tell the layer


455
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,576
to add an animation that
will look kind of like this.


456
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,836
Here we construct
another CABasicAnimation.


457
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:13,206
We set its from value.


458
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:14,076
We set its to value.


459
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,336
And we add it to the
animations on that layer.


460
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,226
Well what does that do?


461
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,486
Well first it doesn't
do anything destructive.


462
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,876
It's not actually setting
the property on the layer.


463
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:26,596
It just temporarily
overrides that property


464
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:28,706
for rendering purposes.


465
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,386
So what are the consequences
of this?


466
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:32,126
If you take a look at
this snippet here we have


467
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:35,236
that basic animation again and
we're interpolating from .75


468
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:41,316
to .25 and it really
is only applying


469
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:42,376
that for rendering purposes.


470
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,086
If you actually ask the layer
what it is while it's doing its


471
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:47,136
interpolation between
.75 and .25,


472
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:48,466
it's going to tell you this.


473
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,886
It's going to tell you it's
opacity is a default value of 1


474
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,686
because nothing has
actually changed


475
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,006
that property inside the layer.


476
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:59,056
So again we have to
have implicit animation


477
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,636
for core animation as well,
why have one of everything


478
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,126
when we can have more than one?


479
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,286
So in this case animations
are avid


480
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:07,546
in response to property changes.


481
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,676
If you call this code
you're setting your property


482
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,506
on your layer, you actually
get all of this for free,


483
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,486
which is kind of handy.


484
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,146
It makes the basic
animation for you.


485
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:18,586
It figures out that the two
values, what you're setting it


486
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,816
from and what the from value
is and what's already on screen


487
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,996
and then it adds it as an
animation to your layer.


488
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:28,126
If you're curious about that
there's more information on this


489
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,136
in the CAAction Protocol which
lives inside of CALayer.h,


490
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,436
you can do some pretty
clever things


491
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,516
but that's beyond the scope of
what we're talking about here.


492
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:37,826
Tying this back into
views though,


493
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:39,356
how does this effect
layer backed views?


494
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:43,186
Well first of all views can
optionally delegate a lot


495
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:45,956
of the drawing of animating
responsibility to CALayer.


496
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,196
And you would generally get this


497
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,446
by studying the wantsLayer
property of your view to yes.


498
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:53,696
And what that does is
it causes your view


499
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:56,836
to manage its own CALayer
and it also causes all


500
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:59,146
of its descendants to
manage their own CALayers.


501
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,966
And there's a few reasons you
might do this besides animation,


502
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,006
performance and memory are the
big ones, and they trade off,


503
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:10,866
sometimes non very predictable
ways but we trust you


504
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,556
to balance it for your
own applications needs.


505
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:14,416
The take away from
this though is


506
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,826
when you're using
a layer back view,


507
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:17,266
it's going to behave
a little differently


508
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,616
than a non-layer
back view, surprise.


509
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:21,946
If you want to know more


510
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,196
about these differences
I encourage you to stick


511
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:27,066
around for our next session,
215, Optimizing Drawing


512
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:27,946
and Scrolling on OS X.


513
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:32,056
I realize this slide says this
was 11 hours ago and we did


514
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,876
in fact run the session 11
hours ago but we're going


515
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:38,036
to run it again in 40
minutes or so just for you.


516
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,301
[laughter and applause]


517
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:45,096
So how does AppKit run the
animation for non-layer


518
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:46,356
or even layer backed view


519
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,166
over not delegating
our responsibility


520
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:48,816
over core animation?


521
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,736
Well first of all we keep
this animation around.


522
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:55,296
It doesn't immediately change
the property in your view.


523
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:59,996
And we periodically wakeup the
main thread to do our animation.


524
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,886
Every time we wakeup we're
going to evaluate that animation


525
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:06,216
for the current time and figure
out what the current value is


526
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:08,256
and we're going to apply it


527
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,116
to the object that's being
animated, in this case the view.


528
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,956
So we're actually replacing
the property inside the view,


529
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:14,936
that means you'll see all


530
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,756
of your key value
accessors get called,


531
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,036
all the change notifications
get called,


532
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,786
all the NS notifications
get posted.


533
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:23,266
And the drawing of this
property actually just happens


534
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:25,616
as a side effect of the
regular NS view drawing cycle.


535
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:26,776
And when we change a property


536
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,156
that effects the visual
appearance of NS view,


537
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,546
the view gets marked as
needing display and we draw


538
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,396
that on the next from loop pass.


539
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:37,516
So here's an example, if you
do an animation you're going


540
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,456
to see this happening,
the main thread wakes up


541
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:42,096
and every time it wakes up it
changes the size of a view.


542
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,976
Core animation works
a little differently


543
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:50,636
so it also stores the animation
in addition to property


544
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,176
on the layer so that's similar.


545
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,016
And this is somewhat
nebulously phrased, it is waking


546
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:58,846
up periodically on a background
thread or maybe another process


547
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,976
but it does different
things from this point on.


548
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:04,936
It evaluates the animation
but only evaluates it as part


549
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:07,546
of rendering so the results
you see on screen aren't going


550
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,106
to be back propagated
into your layer.


551
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:12,386
The property of the layer is
left unchanged and unmodified.


552
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:16,156
So suppose you're
running the same animation


553
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,816
with a layered back view and we
delegate this to core animation.


554
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:22,476
You're going to notice hey
the size on screen is changing


555
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:25,346
but we're never doing
anything on the main thread.


556
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:26,846
None of those key
value accessors


557
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,396
or notifications
are being posted


558
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,686
so that's an important
difference.


559
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:34,146
In general we try to let
core animation drive things


560
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:34,806
because doing stuff


561
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,046
in the background is
usually more performant


562
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,246
and lets us be more generous


563
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:42,436
with what the main
thread can do.


564
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,676
The frame, frame origin
and frame properties


565
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:47,716
of NSView are important
exceptions to this


566
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,936
where we don't necessarily
let Core Animation drive them.


567
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,646
And our decision is
governed largely by the value


568
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:56,456
of the layerContentsRedrawPolicy
of your NSView,


569
00:24:57,256 --> 00:25:00,766
and again that will be covered
in greater detail in session 215


570
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,496
in this room right
after this session.


571
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,236
So I want to call out
this code snippet here.


572
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,076
This is very simple.


573
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,186
We have a window and we
want it to animate in a view


574
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:13,126
so we want it to look like that.


575
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,416
We set the views initial frame


576
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:17,516
and then we told the animator
what its final frame was.


577
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,806
So if we go back to
here the only difference


578
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:23,116
in the snippet is that
we've told it wants a layer.


579
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:26,676
If we run that animation
we see this.


580
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:31,536
Again the screen changed,
it's technically in animation


581
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,046
but it's not a great animation.


582
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:36,786
It's definitely not what we
wanted so why did that happen?


583
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,526
Well first, Core
Animation groups all


584
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,016
of its changes into
transactions.


585
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:44,646
And if you're using
implicit animation,


586
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,286
Core Animation is going to try
to grab the on screen value


587
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:51,006
as your from value but the
view was never on screen


588
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:52,746
so there wasn't any
on screen value.


589
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:56,176
That initial value we set on
the view is actually replaced


590
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:59,026
in that same transaction by the
value we set on the animator


591
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:02,356
so there's at least two
easy ways to fix this


592
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,346
and I'm going to
show them to you.


593
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:08,016
So in this case we're going back
to manually specifying the from


594
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:10,066
and to values of our animation.


595
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:13,706
Again we do that by setting
our animations dictionary


596
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,726
on the view and then telling
the animator to go to the


597
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:16,806
to value as necessary.


598
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,476
Technically we will
automatically fill in the from


599
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:22,996
and to values for
you, in this case the


600
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,746
from value is the
important part to specify.


601
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:26,906
The to value is inferred from
what we're setting the frame


602
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:29,226
on the animator to so it's
optional but leaving it


603
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,806
in there is often
good for clarity.


604
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,566
The other way of doing this is
with animation groups again.


605
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:38,426
And in this we actually
use our changes block


606
00:26:38,426 --> 00:26:41,096
in the animation group to set
the initial value on the view


607
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:44,396
and then we use our completion
handler to tell the animator


608
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,486
to set it to the to value.


609
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:48,216
And in both cases we're going
to get an animation looking


610
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,426
like this, which is
exactly what we want.


611
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:55,276
So at this point I'd like to
welcome my colleague Peter Ammon


612
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:55,856
on stage.


613
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:58,486
He's going to get you
started with Auto Layout.


614
00:26:59,346 --> 00:26:59,976le
Welcome Peter.


615
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:05,076
[ Applause ]


616
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:06,206
>> Peter Ammon: Thanks, Chris.


617
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:08,176
I'm Peter Ammon.


618
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,986
I'm a Cocoa Frameworks Engineer.


619
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,736
I apologize my voice
is a little rough.


620
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:13,676
I'm fighting off a cold.


621
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,766
We'll be talking
about a new class


622
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:18,456
in AppKit called NSStackView
which is really cool


623
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:20,286
and then I'll show you
three different techniques


624
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:25,466
for doing animations in
an auto layout based app.


625
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:28,926
So NSStackView, let's say you
just have a collection of views,


626
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,646
a button, a text field, a label,


627
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:33,936
you want to put them all
together into a list or a stack,


628
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,176
well that's what
NSStackView does for you.


629
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:38,296
Pretty simple, right?


630
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:41,626
Where it gets its flexibility
and its power is from its use


631
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,796
of auto layout, everything
is strung together


632
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:44,726
with constraints.


633
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,396
That means it knows how things
should be sized according


634
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,926
to their intrinsic content size


635
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,466
or any other constraints
you apply.


636
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,116
It knows how things
should be aligned


637
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:56,686
so you can specify a top
alignment, left alignment,


638
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,296
here we have a baseline
alignment.


639
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,146
And it interacts well
with window resizing


640
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,346
so you can make a stack
view that prevents you


641
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,046
from resizing the window
too big or too small


642
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:09,436
so the things wouldn't
clip, etcetera.


643
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:14,006
And this is a really common
type of layout to have


644
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:17,106
and StackView makes it very easy
to create so you can go back


645
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:20,526
to [inaudible] or Mountain
Lion and create these yourself


646
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,246
but with StackView
it's a lot easier.


647
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,726
We figure why stop there?


648
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:28,476
We can make a stack view
that's horizontal or vertical.


649
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:31,536
You can have one that
has flexible spacing


650
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,506
or equal spacing.


651
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:35,036
Equal spacing in particular
is difficult to create


652
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:36,366
with auto layout today.


653
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,126
You can make a StackView
nestable


654
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:41,586
so you can put a stack
inside another one, why not?


655
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,916
And you can have a stack view


656
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,656
that will automatically
have views that get thrown


657
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:49,246
out when the StackView
gets too small or put back


658
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:50,936
in when the StackView
has enough space.


659
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,646
For example, how
NSToolbar does it.


660
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:57,006
And the API for StackView
could not be simpler.


661
00:28:57,306 --> 00:29:00,906
You can create a StackView with
just passing an array of views


662
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,786
to NSStackView, StackView
with Views and you're done.


663
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,796
So we're going to use StackView


664
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,686
to create an inspector
type window.


665
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:11,736
You may have seen this
in FindersGetInfo or in


666
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:12,976
for example a graphics editor.


667
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:18,866
For each of the individual
views in our inspector window,


668
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,286
for example filters, we're going


669
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:21,856
to string it all
together with auto layout.


670
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:24,626
So we have constraints
that specify the positions.


671
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,646
And you'll notice the
bottom constraint is dashed.


672
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,836
That means it's breakable.


673
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:30,736
It has a priority
less than required


674
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,596
and that means it could be
overridden by a constraint


675
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:34,656
with a higher priority.


676
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:37,276
So when we want to
disclose it, when we want


677
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,206
to collapse this view, we're
going to add another constraint


678
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,346
which just says center the
label in the view, that's going


679
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,276
to force the bottom
up until it's centered


680
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:48,566
and that's how we collapse it.


681
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:52,606
And this way we're going
to put these in a StackView


682
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:54,296
and that's how we'll get
the inspector window.


683
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:58,526
So I'm going to show
you a demo of that.


684
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:01,166
So here's the views that we're
going to put in our StackView.


685
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:03,736
We have the header view.


686
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:06,536
We've got three views that
are all kind of similar


687
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:09,286
and I'll zoom in
here and you'll see


688
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,116
that all the labels here are
positioned using auto layout.


689
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:15,876
I use the new X Code 5
Auto Layout Work Code


690
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,136
which is a lot nicer,
for those of you


691
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:19,626
who attended the session earlier
here today you saw that too.


692
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,736
And you'll notice the bottom
constraint has a priority


693
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:28,206
which is still pretty high,
725 but it's not required,


694
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:30,286
which means that a higher
priority constraint can


695
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:30,676
break it.


696
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:36,276
And by the way, one of these
views is itself a StackView.


697
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:38,946
You'll notice that we
have, this is a StackView.


698
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:41,526
We have some basic support
for configuring a StackView


699
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,956
on the interface builder,
in the seed build.


700
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:45,706
But in a future release


701
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:48,096
of X Code hopefully GM
we will have full support


702
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:51,086
for configuring the Stack View
with all the views inside it.


703
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:58,536
So now I'm going to switch
to the window controller.


704
00:30:58,906 --> 00:30:59,826
So window did load.


705
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:03,036
We're going to start by making
a list of all our views,


706
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:04,896
the header, the filter,
the shapes view.


707
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,526
And we're going to
make a StackView.


708
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:09,006
We're going to say
that it's vertical.


709
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,246
Alignment is leading, that
means that it's left aligned.


710
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:14,046
They all have the same
width so it doesn't matter


711
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,796
but if we wanted everything
to be left aligned,


712
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:16,506
that's what we would do.


713
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,136
And there's no spacing
between them.


714
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:21,806
We're going to see oh it
keeps its width and its height


715
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:24,616
with a high priority and
we're going to set it


716
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,956
as a document view of
a certain scroll view,


717
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:29,246
of the scroll view
that's in the window.


718
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:33,966
Next we're going to tell it
how do we position ourselves


719
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:34,616
in the scroll view?


720
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:37,816
Oh using the Visual Format
Language we're going to say


721
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,306
if penned to the
left and the right


722
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,296
so it just fills that width.


723
00:31:41,306 --> 00:31:45,446
Vertically its penned to the
top, that's what that means,


724
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,806
but it's not penned
to the bottom.


725
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:47,706
It can float freely.


726
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:51,806
And this has to be in a flipped
clipped view, by the way.


727
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,596
So in our disclosure
view this is the view


728
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,236
that goes into the StackView.


729
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:00,926
We'll start by creating
a constraint.


730
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:03,036
This is the centering
constraint that I showed you.


731
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:07,126
We're seeing the label
fields center Y is equal


732
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:11,576
to our center Y times 1 plus
0 so it's exactly centered.


733
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:15,136
Now when it comes time to
collapse it we're going


734
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:18,336
to remove that constraint, I'm
sorry, we want to uncollapse it,


735
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:22,006
we remove the constraint, set
the title of our button and say


736
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,056
that we're no longer collapsed.


737
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:27,276
And when we want to collapse
it we add the constraint,


738
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:29,086
set the title and say
that we are collapsed.


739
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:33,426
So that's not a lot of code
but here's the affects you get.


740
00:32:36,276 --> 00:32:37,736
Here's our StackView
and you'll see


741
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:42,946
that I can disclose
things pretty nice


742
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:46,116
and I can resize the window,
for example, I can scroll.


743
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:49,756
So we got this pretty
sophisticated control


744
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:54,376
without a lot of code.


745
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,016
But this is a talk on animation


746
00:32:58,136 --> 00:33:00,926
so how would we make this
disclosure view animate?


747
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,476
Well the desire is that
we want to just switch


748
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:06,166
from our old layout
to the new layout.


749
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,776
We want to just add that
constraint or remove it.


750
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:11,716
But rather than the views just
jumping we want them to animate


751
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,416
from their old position
to the new position.


752
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:17,906
So Chris showed you some
techniques for doing this


753
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,256
in a non-auto layout based
app where you set the frame


754
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:25,856
through the animator
proxy or you set the frame


755
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:28,736
after setting
allowsImplicitAnimation to yes.


756
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:31,986
But with constraints
you're never supposed


757
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:33,056
to set frames directly


758
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:36,956
so how would we do
this with constraints?


759
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:39,256
Well here's some things people
have tried that don't work.


760
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:42,736
What they have done is they've
tried opening the animation


761
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,956
block and saying add constraint


762
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,506
and you'll see that
doesn't animate.


763
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,526
They've tried adding
a constraint


764
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,436
and maybe setting the constant


765
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,396
to something, that
doesn't animate.


766
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:55,776
And here's something people have
tried, they're actually going


767
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:58,876
to call layout on the view
after modifying the constraints.


768
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:02,326
And this might seem to work
but this is really bad,


769
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:03,996
you can see it's
off the page bad.


770
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:07,916
Why does it seem to work?


771
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,856
The underlying step frame calls
must be in an animation block


772
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:13,096
with allows implicit
animation set to yes.


773
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,676
And that's actually
where those calls occur


774
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:16,545
in the layout method.


775
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:19,286
But the layout method
is for overriding.


776
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:21,876
It's not a method you're ever
supposed to invoke yourself,


777
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:23,186
unless you're invoking super.


778
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:28,795
So how do we trigger it
being called by AppKit?


779
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:31,866
Well we're going to start
by adding the constraint.


780
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:34,436
We can do that inside or
outside the animation block,


781
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:37,565
it doesn't matter but
here we do it outside just


782
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:38,266
to make it clear.


783
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:41,366
Or you can set the
constant on a constraint.


784
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,775
If you're not familiar
with a constant


785
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:44,585
on a width constraint
it's just the width,


786
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,755
or it's like the base value.


787
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:48,755
For a spacing constraint,
it's the space


788
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,116
between the two views, etcetera.


789
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:53,106
And then in the animation
block we're going


790
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,045
to say allows implicit
animation yes.


791
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:56,696
And we'll trigger layout


792
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:59,116
by calling view
layoutSubtreeIfNeeded.


793
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:01,946
If you just want to animate that
view and all of its descendants


794
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:04,106
or you can call window
layoutIfNeeded


795
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:05,326
to animate the entire window.


796
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:11,686
So this is the right
way to do or one way


797
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:14,046
to do animation correctly
in an auto layout based app.


798
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:17,186
So let's make our disclosure
view animated in this way.


799
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,446
So I'm already in the right
spot, toggle collapsed,


800
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:27,906
and I've already added
or removed the constraint


801
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:31,266
so now all that's left to do is
open the animation block here.


802
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,676
Say we allow implicit
animation yes.


803
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,786
And then trigger layout if
needed on the entire window.


804
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:44,726
So now when I run this
you'll see that instead


805
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,186
of just jumping the views
actually animate open


806
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,066
and close like that.


807
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:51,946
So just a few lines of code we
went from this very static UI


808
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,826
to a nicely animated control.


809
00:35:55,516 --> 00:36:01,666
[ Applause ]


810
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,086
It's nice when things
take a little code.


811
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:11,686
So that's one technique where
you just set your constraints


812
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:14,526
and you trigger layout
in an animation block.


813
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,716
But another technique is to
animate constraints directly.


814
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:23,236
As I said, constraints have
only one mutable property,


815
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:24,446
once the constraint
has been installed


816
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:26,906
on the view there's only
one thing you can change


817
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,286
about that constraint and we
chose to call that constant.


818
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:34,256
You can animate it
with the animator proxy


819
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,556
so you can say
constraint.animator.constant=17


820
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:39,516
and this uses the same
sort of animations


821
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:40,706
that Chris was telling
you about.


822
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:46,386
I know the constraints do not
respect allowsImplicitAnimation


823
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:49,326
so the constants will
always, you either have


824
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:51,666
to use the animator proxy
if you want animation.


825
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,676
This is because if
they did respect


826
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:56,626
that allowsImplicitAnimation
you might get layouts


827
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,716
which are not allowed
which will cause conflicts


828
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,506
with other constraints.


829
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:03,596
So let's, I'm going to
give you a demo of how


830
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:08,676
to use this technique to make
our StackView animated again.


831
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:13,316
So it was kind of
nice that it animated


832
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:16,216
but the window didn't
change its height, right,


833
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:18,466
so you have to scroll down or
you have to resize the window.


834
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:22,016
It would be a lot nicer if after
you disclose it the window just


835
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:24,016
resized and matched the
height of the StackView.


836
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:27,196
So we're going to do that
by instead of just penning


837
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:30,186
to the top we're also going to
pen to the top and the bottom.


838
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:34,476
And because our layout
priority is high


839
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:39,226
for the vertical orientation,
it's higher than the strength


840
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,936
with which the window
holds its size


841
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,116
so this will actually
push the window taller


842
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:44,146
or force it to shrink.


843
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:50,916
Here's the other implementation
of where we're going


844
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,086
to animate the constraint.


845
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:56,746
Instead of that centering
constraint we're going


846
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:59,666
to have a constraint which
just says what is the height


847
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,846
of my view, of me?


848
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,906
So it's equal to
nil, not an attribute


849
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,476
because we're just setting
the height to a constant


850
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:08,616
and that's going to be
either the collapsed height,


851
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:10,506
which is just the
height of our top part,


852
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:14,106
or our uncollapsed height
which is our fitting size,


853
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:15,156
the height we want to be.


854
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:18,246
And then we're going
to add that constraint


855
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:21,736
and then we set the
title to another button.


856
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:23,556
So then the toggle collapsed.


857
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:27,466
Instead of triggering layout
with the animation block,


858
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,426
we're going to go
through the animator proxy


859
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:32,266
and set the constant to
either the uncollapsed height


860
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:34,206
or the collapsed height.


861
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:40,966
So now when I run
this you'll see


862
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:42,686
that not only does it animate


863
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,066
but it also resizes the
window bigger or smaller.


864
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:50,686
So you may be wondering why did
we use this separate technique?


865
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:54,226
Why couldn't we have just made
the window resized using the old


866
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:55,156
technique for animation?


867
00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:57,426
Well I'll show you what
happens if I do that.


868
00:38:58,006 --> 00:39:01,946
So I if that out, now we're back
to doing the implicit animation


869
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:02,946
and triggering layout.


870
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:08,636
When I run this you'll see
that it, it has this weird kind


871
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:11,926
of jumpy behavior here.


872
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:13,776
So what's going on with that?


873
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:24,616
So what we saw there was a core
animation driven animation.


874
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,616
It's using layers concurrent


875
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,356
with the window resize
animation,


876
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:31,206
which always happens
on the main thread.


877
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:34,206
So when you have these
two animations going


878
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,096
at the same time they may get
out of sync or they may fight.


879
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:39,286
We say don't cross the streams


880
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:43,616
and if you do something terrible
will happen or not quite


881
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,586
that bad but you'll get
drifting or you'll get jitter.


882
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:49,336
You'll see a view maybe
vibrate a bit and this is a clue


883
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:50,766
that there's two
animations going


884
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,926
at once on different threads.


885
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:55,376
So the solution to
this, one solution,


886
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,396
is to go through the
constraints animator


887
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,566
that will do an AppKit driven
animation on the main thread


888
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,666
so it will not be concurrent
with the window resize.


889
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:05,046
Or you can do the
other technique


890
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:06,006
where you can tell the window


891
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:08,186
to just resize itself
in an animated way.


892
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,846
And that's the third
way of doing animations


893
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:14,336
with auto layout, which I'm
going to talk about now.


894
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:19,186
Animating window size changes,
so we're going to switch


895
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:20,786
to a totally different
kind of application.


896
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,446
This is a shopping list app


897
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:25,176
where we have a master
and a detail window.


898
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:26,516
So here we have a shopping list


899
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:29,076
and there's a segmented
control at the bottom right.


900
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:30,826
And when I click
that what I want


901
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:33,936
to have happen is a
side bar will slide out


902
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,386
and the user can select
different shopping lists.


903
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:41,486
So you may have seen this type
of UI in reminders or notes app.


904
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:45,646
So when the user clicks
that segmented control,


905
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,126
we want the window to grow but
it grows in a different way


906
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,906
than if the user had
just resized the window.


907
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:56,426
When the user resizes it we want
the pane on the right to pick


908
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:58,206
up this extra space,
all the slack.


909
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:03,066
But with this kind of animation
what we want is instead all the


910
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:07,816
slack should be taken up
by the pane on the left.


911
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:08,736
So how are we going


912
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:11,706
to accomplish this
animation using auto layout?


913
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:15,656
Well the trick is we're going
to set temporary constraints


914
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,926
that control how the panes
resize so we're going


915
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:20,446
to grow the window and
remove those constraints.


916
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:23,956
But we don't have to add
these constraints ourselves.


917
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:27,466
We can leverage NSSplitView,
which is a great client


918
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,256
and auto layout starting
in Mountain Lion,


919
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,546
to create these constraints
for us.


920
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:36,336
We do that by adjusting
the holding priority


921
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:37,686
of the split view panes.


922
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:39,166
The holding priority
is the strength


923
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,746
of which the split view pane
prefers to hold its size


924
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:44,406
so as the window
gets bigger the pane


925
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:47,466
with the lowest holding priority
will take up all the slack.


926
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,686
So we start by getting
the window framed.


927
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:55,036
And we're just going to
adjust the origin left by 120


928
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:57,936
and adjust the width by 120
so the right edge stays fixed


929
00:41:57,936 --> 00:41:59,296
and the window gets bigger.


930
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:03,736
We're going to lower the holding
priority of the first subview


931
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,776
to 1, which is very low.


932
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,736
We'll then set the frame of
the window and we're going


933
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,186
to pass yes for animate.


934
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:12,816
Instead of just jumping it's
going to cause it to slide out.


935
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:15,036
And then we'll restore
the holding priority


936
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:19,746
of the split view pane.


937
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,986
So this gets us almost
all the way there


938
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:24,856
but there's one thing
we can't quite do,


939
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,686
one remaining wrinkle,
what's that?


940
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:28,936
We want not just the
pane to disappear


941
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:30,316
but also the split view divider.


942
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:34,376
And a split view calls
this collapsing the pane


943
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:36,406
so this is something
it has support for,


944
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,386
which we want to
take advantage of.


945
00:42:38,386 --> 00:42:40,586
But collapsing is a
deliberate user action.


946
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:43,086
There's a special way the
user collapses a pane,


947
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:44,906
it's by dragging more
than halfway across it


948
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:47,566
so it's not something
constraints can just do


949
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:48,266
on their own.


950
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:51,596
However, oh, excuse me,


951
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,196
so here's what constraints
can get you,


952
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,106
they can get almost all the
way down to the last pixel


953
00:42:57,896 --> 00:42:59,556
but to get it the rest
of the way we need


954
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:00,706
to invoke NSSplitView.


955
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:05,616
So the solution is we're going
to shrink the pane as small


956
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,926
as we can get using auto layout.


957
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,606
Then we're going to collapse it


958
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:12,016
by calling setPosition:0
ofDividerAtIndex:0.


959
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:14,376
That says take the divider
and push it all the way


960
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,476
over to the left, which
will cause that pane


961
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:17,346
on the left to collapse.


962
00:43:18,106 --> 00:43:20,886
And to uncollapse it is
almost exactly the same except


963
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:21,516
for backwards.


964
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,136
We start by setting
the position to 1


965
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:25,826
and then we grow the
pane using auto layout.


966
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,536
And don't forget we have
to enable collapsing.


967
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:31,536
We do that by implementing
the delegate method,


968
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:35,806
SplitView canCollapseSubview
and say oh you can collapse it


969
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:38,386
if the subview is the first
subview in a split view


970
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,926
so let's give a demo of that.


971
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:55,046
So here's our master detail view


972
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:57,116
and we have the segmented
control down here.


973
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:58,526
When I click that you'll see


974
00:43:58,526 --> 00:44:00,956
that the split view
slides nicely in and out


975
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:03,256
and I can you know
resize it how I like


976
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:05,286
and then I can collapse
it and collapse it again.


977
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:12,726
How do we accomplish this
in our split view demo?


978
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:14,596
So here's the toggle collapse.


979
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:17,016
This is the action method
of the segmented control.


980
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,906
We start by getting the first
subview of the split view


981
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:21,036
and that's what we
want to collapse.


982
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:25,256
We say that do we want to
collapse it or uncollapse it?


983
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:28,456
And if it's already
collapsed the way we want it,


984
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:29,146
we just return.


985
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:31,986
So we're going to get
the holding priorities


986
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:35,006
of the first subview and the
second subview and we're going


987
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,226
to lower the first one and raise
the second one and we're going


988
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:41,906
to restore them at the end.


989
00:44:41,986 --> 00:44:44,446
Now we're going to call that set
frame display animate method.


990
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,896
So we start by, if
we're collapsing,


991
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:48,856
if we already collapsed,
excuse me,


992
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:51,566
we're going to set the
position to just 1,


993
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,346
1 of the divider
index so that's going


994
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:56,666
to uncollapse it by one pixel.


995
00:44:57,396 --> 00:45:00,216
Then we have to resize
the window by that amount


996
00:45:00,356 --> 00:45:01,806
so that the right
edge stays fixed.


997
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:03,626
Then we're going
to do it the rest


998
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:07,696
of the way just using a setFrame
display, yes, animate, yes.


999
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:11,526
And likewise if the window
is already big we want


1000
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:14,736
to make it small, we
want to collapse it.


1001
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:21,246
We start by, excuse me, we
get the frame, we say yes,


1002
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:23,686
animate yes and then
we, excuse me,


1003
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:24,996
this is using auto layout here,


1004
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:28,216
then to collapse it
we set the position 0


1005
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:31,356
of the divider index zero
and resize the window


1006
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,136
in a non-animated way
for just that last pixel.


1007
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:35,926
And then we restore
the holding priorities


1008
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:37,256
to what they were before so that


1009
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:40,036
when the user resizes it they
get the resizing behavior


1010
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:40,446
we want.


1011
00:45:41,516 --> 00:45:43,696
And here's where we implement
the canCollapseSubview method


1012
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:45,726
to indicate that we can
collapse that first subview.


1013
00:45:46,256 --> 00:45:51,606
So that's how we
get that effect.


1014
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,186
So that's what we have.


1015
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:03,076
For more information you
can contact our Frameworks


1016
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:04,736
Evangelist Jake Behrens.


1017
00:46:05,156 --> 00:46:06,706
There's also really
good documentation


1018
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:08,716
on Core Animation
and Auto Layout.


1019
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:12,336
You can always reach us at
the Apple Development Forums.


1020
00:46:12,576 --> 00:46:14,206
We've got some really
good labs too,


1021
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:15,996
oh later sessions,
related sessions.


1022
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:19,406
Hopefully you saw the really
nice auto layout session


1023
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,266
for interface builder
that was earlier today.


1024
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:24,756
And there's going to be a
session immediately following


1025
00:46:24,756 --> 00:46:27,606
this about Optimizing Drawing
and Scrolling using some


1026
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:28,916
of that responsive
scrolling stuff,


1027
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:31,486
immediately following
in this room.


1028
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:33,776
So what did we see?


1029
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:37,006
We saw NSStackView, how it
can layout views in a list,


1030
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:38,256
horizontally or vertically.


1031
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:41,416
It's a really powerful
new class in Mac OS X.


1032
00:46:41,876 --> 00:46:45,676
We can animate view positions
by adjusting constraints


1033
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:47,916
and triggering layout
within an animation block.


1034
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:51,016
By using layers you can
produce very smooth animations.


1035
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:54,346
We saw how you can animate
constraints directly


1036
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:56,966
by using the animator
proxy NSLayout constraint


1037
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:59,056
and this allows you
to resize windows.


1038
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:02,196
We saw a third technique
which is you set


1039
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:03,566
up your constraints
the way you want


1040
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:07,176
and then you tell the window to
resize then pass yes for animate


1041
00:47:07,176 --> 00:47:11,276
and then the animation will
cause the content to reflow


1042
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:12,176
in the way you specify.


1043
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,396
But be careful to not
use core animation,


1044
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:18,106
driven animations
alongside window resizing,


1045
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:19,926
we call that crossing
the streams.


1046
00:47:19,926 --> 00:47:21,536
You'll get that jitter
or you'll get drifting.


1047
00:47:22,826 --> 00:47:23,836
Thank you very much.


1048
00:47:23,836 --> 00:47:24,966
Enjoy the rest of your week.
