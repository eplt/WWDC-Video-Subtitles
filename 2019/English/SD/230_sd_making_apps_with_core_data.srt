00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:08,976
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:13,896
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:15,866
Welcome to making apps with Core


5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:16,386
Data.


6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,426
I'm Scott Perry.


7
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:18,556
I work on the Core Data team.


8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,576
And today, we're going to have


9
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:22,926
an accelerated refresher with a


10
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:24,466
focus on best practices.


11
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:25,966
We'll talk about how to get up


12
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:27,206
and running with Core Data, how


13
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,576
to set up an app's controllers


14
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,326
for success.


15
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:31,446
And as well as how to use


16
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,176
multiple coordinators and


17
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:34,396
scaling involving that.


18
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:36,386
Then we'll wrap up with some


19
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:37,476
useful testing tips.


20
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,296
So let's get started.


21
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:41,726
This year, we released a new


22
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:42,316
sample app.


23
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,766
You may have already seen it in


24
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,696
Session 202.


25
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:45,686
It starts out with a list of


26
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:45,976
posts.


27
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,736
We can add a new post by tapping


28
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:52,096
on the Plus button at the top.


29
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,416
And have a closer look in


30
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,486
DetailViewController.


31
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,256
So you can here -- see here that


32
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,476
this is like a blogging app.


33
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,616
It's supposed to support a


34
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:02,606
title, content, multiple tags,


35
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:03,876
as well as multiple media


36
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,346
attachments where you can see


37
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:05,976
the thumbnails down here.


38
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:10,326
Let's change the title and then


39
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:10,956
also add a tag.


40
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:14,746
Hello.


41
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:16,836
Great.


42
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,496
We'll save that and head back to


43
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,046
the ListView.


44
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:22,796
Now let's look at the


45
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:23,486
TagManager.


46
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:24,786
You can see here that we only


47
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,396
have one tag, called Demo, and


48
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:27,546
it has three posts.


49
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,706
So let's add two more, one named


50
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,376
Cats.


51
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:33,906
And another one named Dogs.


52
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:36,136
All right, we'll dismiss this


53
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,266
and then go back into our little


54
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,806
toolbar here and add 1000


55
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,216
randomly-generated posts.


56
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:42,836
Here we go.


57
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,496
And if we go back to our tag


58
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:48,206
list, we can see Dogs are more


59
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:49,196
popular than Cats.


60
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:49,476
It's science.


61
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:54,056
[ Chuckling ]


62
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:55,736
So now that we've seen our app,


63
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,906
let's think about the shape of


64
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:57,486
its data.


65
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:00,366
The most obvious type is posts.


66
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,486
So we'll start with that.


67
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,716
But since we support multiple


68
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,896
media attachments, that's


69
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:05,496
another type.


70
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:06,986
And then we'll also need a tag


71
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,156
type for the same reason.


72
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,936
But since attachments might be


73
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,276
quite large, we'll want to store


74
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,286
that data separately.


75
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,376
After all, the list view only


76
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,356
needs to show thumbnails, so we


77
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,176
can keep the larger data


78
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:18,626
elsewhere.


79
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,456
Now that we've organized the


80
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,036
shape of our data, it's a pretty


81
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,166
straightforward process to


82
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,976
transliterate it into a Core


83
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:27,276
Data model using the Model


84
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,126
Editor and Xcode.


85
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,386
Here, we define the members of


86
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:32,746
our modeled types, as well as


87
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:33,976
the relationships between them.


88
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:37,126
For example, the relationship


89
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:38,126
between attachments and their


90
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,756
data is one-to-one.


91
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:41,916
That is, an attachment can only


92
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,686
be backed by one image data, and


93
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,236
an image data can only represent


94
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:45,936
one attachment.


95
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,376
We can also tell our Core Data


96
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,586
in the model that if the


97
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,136
attachment is deleted, then its


98
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:52,406
image data should be cleaned up


99
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,056
automatically.


100
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,436
This is called a cascade


101
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:54,976
deletion rule.


102
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:58,746
Meanwhile, the double arrow


103
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,016
heads signify a too-many


104
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:00,706
relationship.


105
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,576
Here, a post may have many


106
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,086
attachments, but an attachment


107
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,856
will only ever belong to one


108
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:05,976
post.


109
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,336
And finally, the post may have


110
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,046
many tags.


111
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,806
Tags may be on many posts.


112
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:12,676
This is a many-too-many


113
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:12,976
relationship.


114
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,516
So now, we've defined a managed


115
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:19,216
object model.


116
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,506
But there are a few more Core


117
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:21,706
Data types that we need to get


118
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:22,976
familiar with before we're ready


119
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:23,696
to build our app.


120
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,326
The model is required by a


121
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,636
PersistentStoreCoordinator,


122
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,516
which as the name implies, is


123
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:30,696
responsible for managing our


124
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:31,686
persistent stores.


125
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:33,786
Most of the time, this is a


126
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:34,936
database that lives on the file


127
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,316
system, though it's possible to


128
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,516
have many stores at once,


129
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,296
including our own custom made


130
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,406
types that derive from


131
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:41,336
NSPersistentStore.


132
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:44,626
Finally, the type that we'll


133
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:45,976
spend the most time with is the


134
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,246
ManagedObjectContext.


135
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,446
Core Data uses the command


136
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,156
pattern, which is really a fancy


137
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,166
way of saying that you need a


138
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,616
context to get anything done.


139
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,216
If you want to execute a fetch


140
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,986
request, you need a context.


141
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,246
Dirty-to-managed object, the


142
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,566
context knows about it, and will


143
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,716
save it on your command.


144
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,066
Contexts needs to know a


145
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,276
coordinator in order to do their


146
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:05,556
work.


147
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,526
And as I mentioned earlier, the


148
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:08,696
coordinator has to know about


149
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:09,686
the model to make sense of


150
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:10,356
stores.


151
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:12,446
The types are all sufficiently


152
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:13,086
interdependent.


153
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,226
But coordinator provides one


154
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,586
type that encapsulates them all


155
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,986
and represents the entire stack,


156
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:18,755
called a persistent container.


157
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,606
Using a persistent container, we


158
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,106
can set up a stack in just a few


159
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,106
lines of code, especially if the


160
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:24,976
model lives in our bundle.


161
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,336
All we need to do is refer to it


162
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,926
by name, and the persistent


163
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:31,976
container will load it for us.


164
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,586
If the model is generated in


165
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,656
code, or we need to use the same


166
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:39,096
model with multiple containers,


167
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,126
there's another initializer that


168
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:40,976
gives us the control we need.


169
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,166
Once we have a container, we


170
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,296
tell it to load our persistent


171
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:47,756
stores.


172
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,576
The completion block gets called


173
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,686
once per store with a nil error


174
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:53,766
parameter on success, after


175
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:55,476
which is time to shift our focus


176
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:59,686
to managed object contexts.


177
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,096
Contexts provide us with


178
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,686
seamless access to managed data,


179
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:04,386
and they have a few options that


180
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,816
can make them even more useful


181
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,556
to certain use cases, such as


182
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:07,976
driving our views.


183
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,086
The first of these is support


184
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:13,226
for query generations.


185
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,556
Query generations provide a


186
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:17,386
stable view of the stores data,


187
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,716
allowing safe and consistent


188
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,446
access to objects, even if


189
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,406
they're changed or deleted by


190
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,076
another actor.


191
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:25,976
To enable this, set the


192
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,436
context's query generation to


193
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:27,926
current.


194
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,166
Current is a floating meta


195
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:30,696
version.


196
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,136
The context's query generation


197
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:33,776
will get pinned to a concrete


198
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,736
point in time on the next access


199
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:35,976
to the store.


200
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:38,546
[Chuckles]


201
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,106
Now the context has a stable


202
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,416
view of the data in the store.


203
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,776
What about keeping it up-to-date


204
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,796
with the latest changes?


205
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:45,616
Well, in the Stone Ages, we


206
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,886
would register for context and


207
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,026
save notifications.


208
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:50,126
But contexts can also be


209
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,766
configured to keep themselves


210
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,456
up-to-date as changes are saved


211
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:54,256
by their siblings.


212
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,206
Just that automatically emerges


213
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:57,966
changes from parent to true.


214
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,646
Okay, so now all of our stack


215
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:03,566
types are configured to our


216
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,806
liking, how do we use them in


217
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:05,726
our app?


218
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:07,656
The most important thing to


219
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,406
remember when using a context is


220
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:10,866
that all store requests and


221
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:11,866
interactions with managed


222
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,146
objects must be done in the


223
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,076
context queue.


224
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,556
Background contexts each have


225
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:17,396
their own queue.


226
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,086
So using them requires the


227
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,016
perform API's.


228
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,086
There's a blocking invariant, as


229
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,356
well as an asynchronous version.


230
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:26,736
But for truly asynchronous work,


231
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,266
the container offers a


232
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,336
convenience method for


233
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,966
performing background tasks that


234
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,516
creates a background context for


235
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,016
you, and disposes of it


236
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:34,756
automatically when your block


237
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:34,976
returns.


238
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,596
So now, how do we add data to


239
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:40,906
our app?


240
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,636
Well, if we only need a couple


241
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,616
of objects, it's easy to use the


242
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,906
initializer provided by the


243
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,556
managed object sub classes that


244
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,856
were generated for us from our


245
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,006
model by Xcode.


246
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,616
If the subclass is only used by


247
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,336
one model, then it already knows


248
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,666
which entity it represents.


249
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,116
So we can use in it with


250
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:57,716
context.


251
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,516
Once it's been registered with


252
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:00,556
the context, then we can


253
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,826
configure it, treating it like


254
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,016
any other instance variable.


255
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:05,666
Once it's set up to our liking,


256
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:08,016
we call the contextSave method


257
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:08,976
to persist it to storage.


258
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,516
But what if we need more data?


259
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,666
Most apps aren't content with


260
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,216
inserting a handful of objects


261
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:18,766
at a time.


262
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:20,456
Chances are good, you've got a


263
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,216
server component that sends


264
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,796
objects back by the hundreds or


265
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:24,486
thousands.


266
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:26,366
We can save these to the store


267
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,226
one at a time, like we were just


268
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,826
doing for a couple objects.


269
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,186
But it's a lot of boilerplate to


270
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:32,626
write, not to mention a lot of


271
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:33,386
resource overhead, to have all


272
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:33,976
of those in-memory at once.


273
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:39,246
Enter batch insertions, the


274
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:40,666
first of many new features we'll


275
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,816
be talking about today.


276
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,766
This code fragment is worth 1000


277
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:45,446
objects.


278
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:46,986
And it all starts with your


279
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:48,306
de-serialized payload in the


280
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,246
form of an array of dictionaries


281
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:49,976
that have string keys.


282
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,916
These keys need to line up with


283
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,356
the names of your attributes in


284
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:56,806
the model.


285
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,956
It's okay to leave some out if


286
00:07:58,956 --> 00:07:59,736
they're not required by


287
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:00,766
something like a unique


288
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:01,356
constraint.


289
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:03,266
If you've configured default


290
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,536
values in your model, then Core


291
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:04,976
Data will use those.


292
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,026
In this case, we have three


293
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,256
dictionaries that each cover a


294
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,456
different set of content and


295
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,456
title attributes.


296
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,736
Going back to our code, we


297
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:16,206
create a batch insert request


298
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,346
with our array of dictionaries,


299
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,616
as well as the objects model


300
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,906
entity, which is also available


301
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,096
through a method on the managed


302
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,416
object subclass that was


303
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,926
generated for us by Xcode.


304
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,666
Then we execute the request, and


305
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,766
the context returns a response,


306
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,816
which wraps a Boolean, that


307
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,426
tells us if the operation


308
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:32,976
succeeded.


309
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,246
We're getting a lot for free


310
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:36,506
here.


311
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,126
And I know you're thinking.


312
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,126
What's the catch?


313
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:41,775
Well, there's not really many


314
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:42,696
sharp edges here.


315
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,076
And a lot of this is going to


316
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:45,196
sound familiar if you've used


317
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,556
batch updates or batch


318
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,216
deletions.


319
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:50,186
If you have unique constraints


320
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:51,706
than any existing objects


321
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,036
matching the dictionary will be


322
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:53,956
pulled out of the database and


323
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:55,746
updated with new values instead.


324
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:59,206
Attributes that are optional or


325
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,716
configured with default values


326
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:01,706
can be omitted from the


327
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,666
dictionary as well.


328
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,516
In the case of updating an


329
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,976
object with unique constraint,


330
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:06,796
the existing values will not be


331
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:06,976
changed.


332
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,666
This goes for relationships as


333
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:11,996
well.


334
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,056
Batch insertions can't be used


335
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:15,186
to set relationships.


336
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,336
But if a batch insert updates an


337
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,816
existing object due to a unique


338
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,186
constraint, the existing


339
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,246
relationships will be left


340
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:21,606
alone.


341
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,736
And finally, like the other


342
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,096
batch operations, batch


343
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,046
insertions do not generate a


344
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,796
contextDidSaveNotification, so


345
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:30,746
you'll have to manage that on


346
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:30,976
your own.


347
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,636
Now that we have some data,


348
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,216
let's talk about how to satisfy


349
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,406
the needs of our controllers.


350
00:09:36,936 --> 00:09:38,916
The first thing that a


351
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,866
controller needs to be able to


352
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,706
do, is fetch and present data.


353
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:42,806
So let's look at that.


354
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:45,716
We use a fetch request to get


355
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:46,936
objects out of the store.


356
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:48,926
And just like getting the entity


357
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,286
when we created new objects,


358
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,376
there's a method on the managed


359
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,996
object subclass type generated


360
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,596
by Xcode, that will give us a


361
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:55,976
preconfigured fetch request.


362
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,666
Adding a predicate to the


363
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,306
request allows us to refine our


364
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,296
results, in this case, so we can


365
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:03,836
fetch a tag by its name.


366
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:09,166
Once we've executed the request,


367
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,306
you pluck the results out and


368
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:10,976
use it to configure our views.


369
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:15,626
This works well for immutable


370
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:16,056
data.


371
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,576
But what if the tag's name or


372
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,136
color changes while our view is


373
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:19,376
up?


374
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,406
Our managed object context will


375
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:22,296
make sure that the objects'


376
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,366
properties get updated.


377
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,006
But we haven't done any of the


378
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,146
plumbing here necessary to


379
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,336
observe those changes.


380
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,256
As many of you know, managed


381
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,906
objects have supported key value


382
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,226
observations since the dawn of


383
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:33,636
time.


384
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,006
But the combined framework,


385
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,956
announced this week, makes KVO


386
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:39,576
much easier to use in Swift.


387
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,696
We get a publisher out of the


388
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,326
object for each property we want


389
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,916
to wire up, and sync the data


390
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,986
flow into an assignment


391
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:48,276
subscriber on the view.


392
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,656
In the case of the tag's color,


393
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,946
we have an extra map step in the


394
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,356
middle to make the types lineup.


395
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,116
This is all the code we need to


396
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:56,416
write.


397
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,816
And our ViewsContents will


398
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,206
automatically get updated now


399
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,476
whenever the underlying object


400
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:00,976
changes.


401
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:06,156
[ Cheering and Applause ]


402
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,046
Yeah, Combine is great.


403
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,256
And this is barely scratching


404
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,496
the surface of the framework.


405
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,176
It provides a lot more, very


406
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,166
powerful, data flow


407
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:13,996
functionality.


408
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,216
And to learn more, I encourage


409
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,246
you to check out Session 721.


410
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,906
Now there is a deceit you may


411
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:21,046
have noticed to this evolution


412
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,626
of our code, and it's that


413
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,756
DetailViews almost never


414
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:24,956
actually have to fetch the


415
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:26,606
object that they're presenting.


416
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,546
Usually this kind of view is


417
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,926
pushed from a parent that


418
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,086
configures it with a managed


419
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:31,596
object.


420
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:33,366
So normally, the code we'd write


421
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,476
would actually look like this.


422
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,656
The Parent to our DetailView is


423
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:40,456
usually some kind of list view,


424
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:41,516
like a Collection or a


425
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,206
TableView.


426
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,476
It also gets its objects from a


427
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:45,186
fetch request.


428
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,206
But there are a few more


429
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,156
properties that we haven't


430
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,726
talked about that are important


431
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:49,646
when fetching a bunch of


432
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:49,976
objects.


433
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,236
The first is the


434
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,446
requestSortDescriptors.


435
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,936
These define the order of the


436
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:57,706
results.


437
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,366
In this case, we're sorting our


438
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:00,266
tags by name.


439
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,106
But if names weren't unique


440
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,416
enough, we'd want to add another


441
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,626
descriptor to the end of the


442
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,976
array to break any ties.


443
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,596
Another useful option is


444
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,116
fetching.


445
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:11,996
If our fetch request is going to


446
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,266
match 14 million objects, we


447
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,536
don't want them to all get


448
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,686
loaded into memory at the same


449
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,146
time.


450
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:19,076
Even if we had the memory for


451
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,786
that, which we probably don't,


452
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,356
it would take a long time.


453
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,346
Instead, we configure a fetch


454
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,076
batch size to tell the context


455
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:27,036
how many objects should be


456
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,466
loaded from the store at a time.


457
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,516
This makes a big difference on


458
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,736
our app's responsiveness.


459
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:32,786
But it only works when


460
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,096
interacting with the result as


461
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:34,896
an MS Array.


462
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,026
Swift's array bridging defeats


463
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,016
this optimization.


464
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,416
So with this knowledge, it's


465
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,806
pretty easy to set up a fetch


466
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:46,396
request that will fetch all the


467
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,656
tags that we want to see.


468
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,836
But what if one gets changed?


469
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,956
Just like with the properties of


470
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,046
an object that we're displaying


471
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:55,666
in a detailed view, we need some


472
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,136
way to keep up with the objects


473
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,266
as the career changes.


474
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,386
Luckily, Core Data supports live


475
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,786
queries in the form of a Fetch


476
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:03,596
Results Controller.


477
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,246
Here we've configured a request


478
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:07,876
to fetch all posts ordered by


479
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,336
title, 50 at a time.


480
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,046
This fetch request is joined by


481
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,856
a context to configure a type we


482
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,116
haven't talked about yet called


483
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:16,376
a fetchedResults Controller.


484
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,496
It communicates changes to the


485
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,046
fetch requests through a


486
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:21,546
delegate protocaller and starts


487
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:22,656
working as soon as you tell it


488
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:23,696
to perform the fetch.


489
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,976
Now the Fetch Results Controller


490
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,226
is probably well known to many


491
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:28,816
of you already.


492
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:30,716
The delegate protocols change


493
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:32,106
reporting callbacks include a


494
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,416
method to tell you when changes


495
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,846
are going to begin coming in.


496
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,566
Another to tell you when a


497
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,276
section changed in some way.


498
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,756
And another tell you for each


499
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,176
object that changed, how it


500
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:43,756
changed.


501
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,586
And finally, a method to tell


502
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,436
you that we're done.


503
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,386
And you know everything.


504
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,796
These methods were originally


505
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,426
designed to line up closely with


506
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:54,136
UITableView's API, but there was


507
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,546
still a fair amount of glue code


508
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,926
to write matching the career


509
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:58,486
query results to the table


510
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:59,146
redrawing.


511
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:01,346
Furthermore, newer collection


512
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,766
views don't support this change


513
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:03,516
callback pattern.


514
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,616
So I'm very happy to announce


515
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:07,326
that the Fetch Results


516
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,386
Controller has learned some new


517
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,166
tricks this year.


518
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,656
The first is a delegate method


519
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,136
that vends an instance of


520
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,586
NSDiffableData SourceSnapshot.

It sounds like a lot of you


523
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:21,536
already know what this type is.


524
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,496
But in case you don't, it's a


525
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,106
new type in UIKit MapKit that


526
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,376
represents the structure of a


527
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:27,566
collection or TableView.


528
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,756
To use one, you configure your


529
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:31,106
TableView's data source to be


530
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:32,976
one of the DiffableDataSource,


531
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:34,646
also new this year, and feed it


532
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:35,406
snapshots.

You can learn more about these


534
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,876
types in Session 220.


535
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,196
But for all our purposes, all


536
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,576
you need to know is that you can


537
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:43,746
use them to keep your collection


538
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:44,916

539
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,686
line of code.

remainder of the slide.

00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:00,346
what makes it a


551

552
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:04,046

559
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:14,906
works great for wholesale

control of the collection view.

562
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:18,086
something that allows more

00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,026
difference between, and can be


578
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,916
generated from, two collections.


579
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:46,776
Collection diffing in the Swift


580
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,306
standard library was introduced


581
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:50,206
in Swift Evolution Proposal 240.


582
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,596
But it also exists in


583
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:52,196
Foundation.


584
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,036
And you can learn more about


585
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:53,946
that in Session 711.


586
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:57,226
For our purposes, it's a


587
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,236
one-dimensional type.


588
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,676
So it's only supported when


589
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:00,686
you're not using section


590
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:01,226
fetching.


591
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,416
And like the SnapshotDelegate


592
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,976
method, it's mutually exclusive


593
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,296
with the legacy change reporting


594
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:06,956
methods.


595
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,276
So if you want to drive multiple


596
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:09,416
things from a Fetched Results


597
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,936
Controller, you should use


598
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,526
multiple Fetched Results


599
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:11,956
controllers.


600
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:15,756
So let's take a quick look at


601
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:16,856
how we can drive a single


602
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,476
section of a collection view


603
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,276
using these differences.


604
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:22,496
Here's our Delegate method.


605
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,436
And at the very top, we start by


606
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,016
kicking off a batch update, and


607
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,286
looping over the changes in the


608
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:27,716
diff.


609
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:30,776
CollectionDifferences support


610
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,826
two kinds of changes, Insert and


611
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,406
Remove.


612
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:35,266
And two changes of opposing


613
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:36,676
types may refer to each other


614
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:37,856
through association.


615
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,196
So in the first case, we have an


616
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,756
insertion that has an associated


617
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:42,226
removal.


618
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,516
This means the object has moved,


619
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,006
or at least changed.


620
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,196
It may not have actually moved


621
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:48,146
logical position.


622
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,706
But it doesn't matter, because


623
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:50,916
the CollectionView is smart


624
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,216
enough to tell the difference.


625
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:53,066
And as long as we give it the


626
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,536
right original and destination


627
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,476
IndexPaths, then it will do the


628
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:56,976
right thing.


629
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,456
In the second case, we have an


630
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:00,816
insert of an object that was not


631
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:01,986
previously part of the Fetched


632
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:02,546
Results.


633
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:03,876
So we tell the CollectionView to


634
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:04,886
add it.


635
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,846
Finally, we match all removes


636
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,106
that weren't part of an


637
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,386
associated move by filtering for


638
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,846
new associations, and then


639
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:13,556
remove those from the


640
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:14,205
CollectionView.


641
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:16,435
And that's it.


642
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,496
And you'll notice that this code


643
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,366
composes well.


644
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:20,816
So it's a good candidate for


645
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,866
factoring into a function to


646
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,165
further reduce your boilerplate,


647
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:25,486
because all the state you need


648
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:27,496
is the CollectionView and the


649
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:28,026
difference.


650
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:29,726
So we think people are really


651
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:30,786
going to love these new delegate


652
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:31,266
methods.


653
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:32,996
But the old ones find new life


654
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:33,706
this year as well.


655
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,436
The Swift UI framework


656
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,856
introduces first-party support


657
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,966
for declarative interfaces, but


658
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:39,896
it can't be driven with


659
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:40,956
Snapshots or diffs.


660
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:42,946
But this model type can be


661
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,136
derived from our list of Fetched


662
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:45,746
Results.


663
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:47,936
Conveniently, the existing


664
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:48,456
controller,


665
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:50,456
didChangeContentDelegateMethod


666
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:51,736
will tell us every time an


667
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,156
updated set of Fetched Results


668
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:53,946
is ready to update our views.


669
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,366
So it's easy now to apply


670
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,566
Fetched Results to our views.


671
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,396
But what if the results


672
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,836
themselves were difficult to


673
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:02,476
fetch?


674
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,826
What if we wind up being unable


675
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:05,916
to build a fetch request to


676
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,326
fetch our data?


677
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:09,296
Or what if we wind up with


678
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,056
performance problems when we


679
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,326
execute our fetch requests?


680
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:15,026
At a certain point, the needs of


681
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:15,776
the controller outweigh the


682
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,076
needs of the model, and we have


683
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,556
to give up some modeling purity


684
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,316
in order to accomplish our


685
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:20,876
goals.


686
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:23,116
We do this with denormalization.


687
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,486
We talked a bit about


688
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:28,206
denormalization during WWDC 2018


689
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,786
in Session 224.


690
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:32,296
But to recap, denormalization is


691
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,846
when we keep copies of our data,


692
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,276
so access can be more efficient.


693
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:37,226
This comes with the price of


694
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:38,106
some additional overhead


695
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:39,486
maintaining that extra data.


696
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:40,266
But there are a lot of


697
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,616
circumstances where this


698
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,766
tradeoff is a no-brainer.


699
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,546
Databases indexes are a good


700
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:46,556
example of this.


701
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:47,926
In exchange for maintaining a


702
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,526
copy of all of our indexed


703
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,196
columns, were rewarded with


704
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,566
lightning-fast queries when they


705
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,606
depend on those columns.


706
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:57,386
Looking back at our app,


707
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,016
denormalization is also a useful


708
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,266
way for us to keep track how


709
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,076
many posts are using each tag.


710
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,546
All we need to do is add an


711
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,036
integer attribute to the tag


712
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,106
type named postCount.


713
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,256
Now all we have to do is make


714
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,386
sure that this new postCount


715
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,726
attribute gets incremented every


716
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,386
time a post is tagged and


717
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:19,566
decremented every time a tag is


718
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:20,516
removed from a post.


719
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,606
Surely, this code will be bug


720
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:23,676
free, and our data consistent


721
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:23,976
forever, right?


722
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,266
[ Chuckling ]


723
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:29,616
Right? [Chuckles] No, enter


724
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:30,846
derived attributes.


725
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:32,896
[Chuckles] Derived attributes


726
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,036
are normalized metadata that's


727
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,776
maintained for you by Core Data.


728
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,536
And it's not just for counts.


729
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,826
There's a bunch of supported


730
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,996
functions that you can find in


731
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:41,926
the documentation.


732
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,266
Derived attributes are defined


733
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:46,746
in the managed object model.


734
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,016
The Model Editor in Xcode has a


735
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,346
new interface for this.


736
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:51,786
Or you can define derived


737
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,636
attributes in code using the new


738
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:53,876
type,


739
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,486
NSDerivedAttributeDescription.


740
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,436
And finally, derivation


741
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,126
expressions can refer to any of


742
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,276
the properties of an entity, one


743
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:02,976
level deep.


744
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:06,106
Derived attributes make


745
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,736
denormalization super easy.


746
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:09,236
And I'd love to take a moment


747
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,866
now to show you how to adopt


748
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:10,956
them.


749
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:15,426
Here we have our app, just as


750
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:15,846
before.


751
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:19,196
And if we look in our Tag


752
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,406
Manager here, we can see that we


753
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,586
have three tags and a whole


754
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:24,486
bunch of posts.


755
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,316
But the view code that's driving


756
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,616
this here is actually traversing


757
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:30,346
the relationship posts and


758
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,026
getting its count, which faults


759
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,476
in the relationship when we do


760
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:33,636
it.


761
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,686
So if we had many orders of


762
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,156
magnitude more data, this could


763
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,146
wind up being a performance


764
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,066
problem for us.


765
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,506
So let's fix that by using


766
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,806
derived attributes in our model.


767
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,776
Here's our model editor.


768
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,186
And we're looking at the tag


769
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:48,926
type right now.


770
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,456
So we're going to go in here and


771
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,106
add a new attribute called


772
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:55,526
postCount.


773
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,336
And we're going to make that an


774
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:57,976
integer type.


775
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,156
Now if we go over to the


776
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,916
inspector here, we can see a new


777
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,696
checkbox that says derived.


778
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,836
And if we click it, we wind up


779
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:09,226
with a space for a derivation


780
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:09,746
expression.


781
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,656
So here, we're basically moving


782
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:14,306
our code from the view into


783
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:14,716
here.


784
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:15,956
Let's say posts.


785
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:18,336
@counts, since we're using an


786
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,246
aggregate function.


787
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:22,976
And then that's it.


788
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:24,936
If we rebuild, Xcode will


789
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,446
rebuild our managed object sub


790
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,116
classes.


791
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,696
And when we go back to the view,


792
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:32,556
here, we will find a new


793
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:33,926
instance variable called


794
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,496
postCount, but it's not


795
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:35,936
optional.


796
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,266
So we get to delete even more


797
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:38,436
code by getting rid of this


798
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,086
conditional.


799
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,116
If we build and run, we should


800
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:42,976
see that nothing changed.

[ Chuckling ]


802
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,586
Except it's way faster and


803
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:47,836
better.


804
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:48,476
And we don't have to keep


805
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:49,216
anything up-to-date.


806
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:50,536
And sure enough, there it is.


807
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:54,886
[ Applause ]


808
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:57,006
The complete set of supported


809
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:58,446
derivations is available in the


810
00:21:58,446 --> 00:21:59,386
developer docs.


811
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:01,286
But generally speaking, they


812
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,506
come in four classes.


813
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,496
The simplest is outright


814
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,366
duplication, like keeping a copy


815
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:07,936
of an attachments identifier and


816
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,126
the image data that backs it.


817
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,696
The other kind of derivation is


818
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,116
a simple transformation of the


819
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,146
fields, such as lower casing a


820
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:16,426
tag's name, or canonicalizing


821
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:16,976
some Unicode string.


822
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,656
We just saw an example of an


823
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,056
aggregate function across a too


824
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,466
many relationship in the demo.


825
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:27,066
And lastly, there are global


826
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:29,716
functions such as now that take


827
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,306
no parameters at all, which are


828
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,026
useful for things like keeping


829
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,406
track of when an object was last


830
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:34,856
updated.


831
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,606
So now that our controller is


832
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,906
wont for nothing, it's time to


833
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,166
talk about some more advanced


834
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,156
topics and scaling.


835
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,416
PersistentHistory was introduced


836
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,626
in 2017 as a tool to help you do


837
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,186
things like process data added


838
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:48,126
by an importer, or maintain data


839
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,866
consistency across multiple


840
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,376
active coordinators that are


841
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,346
using the same store.


842
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,126
New this year, we've recruited


843
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,956
fetch requests to make it easier


844
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:58,156
to look up only the history


845
00:22:58,156 --> 00:22:58,936
you're interested in.


846
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:01,616
Maybe you want to look up the


847
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:04,076
changes made by an extension, or


848
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,176
only changes that affect posts,


849
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,236
or only history within a certain


850
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,106
range of time.


851
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,706
I think what is the power of the


852
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:12,096
fetch request applied to your


853
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:12,976
PersistentHistory.


854
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,036
Now and


855
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:17,626
NSPersistentHistoryTransaction


856
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,366
and NSPersistentHistoryChange


857
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,006
are not modeled types, but


858
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:22,286
they've both sprouted some new


859
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:24,336
cross-methods to make them work


860
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,786
with fetch requests.


861
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,416
If you squint, the new methods


862
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,316
look similar to what you would


863
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,056
find generated by Xcode for your


864
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:30,966
managed object subclass types.


865
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,256
They include accessories for an


866
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:35,756
entity description corresponding


867
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:37,926
to the type, as well as a method


868
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:38,936
that produces a new


869
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,296
preconfigured fetch requests


870
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,886
that will return instances of


871
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:42,856
the type, either


872
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,726
NSPersistentHistoryTransaction


873
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,606
or NSPersistentHistoryChange


874
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:47,666
when executed.


875
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,126
You configure the fetch request


876
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,256
to the predicate, just like your


877
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:52,646
fetching managed objects.


878
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:53,906
But instead of executing the


879
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,486
fetch requests directly against


880
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,516
the context, the fetch request


881
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:58,716
gets used as part of a


882
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,826
PersistentHistoryRequest.


883
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,396
There's a new convenience


884
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:04,316
initializer on


885
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:05,416
NSPersistentHistory


886
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,296
ChangeRequest for creating a new


887
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:08,836
instance with a fetch request,


888
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:10,406
as well as immutable property


889
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,516
you can use for post-talk


890
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,396
configuration.


891
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,666
Harnessing fetch requests for


892
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,356
PersistentHistory provides a lot


893
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,366
of granularity to our


894
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:18,986
application.


895
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,346
But there's still the question


896
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:21,706
of how do we know when history


897
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:21,976
gets made?


898
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:25,636
There are a lot of ways we could


899
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:26,726
do this, but they all have


900
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:27,656
drawbacks.


901
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,626
We could pull the store for


902
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:30,886
changes every so often.


903
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,506
But it's hard to tune that kind


904
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,436
of solution for the right


905
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:35,626
compromise between wasted effort


906
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,526
and delays before changes are


907
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,226
noticed.


908
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:40,936
File System monitoring systems


909
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,566
like Dispatch Sources, or


910
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,676
FSEvents, are useful, but they


911
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,356
only work with file back stores,


912
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,066
they're not trivial to adopt.


913
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,096
And it's likely that you'll get


914
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,386
a lot of notifications that


915
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:51,626
don't actually correspond to


916
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,786
changes being committed to the


917
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:53,246
store.


918
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:54,556
So there's still a lot of wasted


919
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:54,976
effort there.


920
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,396
While useful as Band-Aids, these


921
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,516
approaches are all imperfect


922
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:00,846
solutions to the problem of


923
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,556
knowing when other coordinators


924
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:02,976
change the store.


925
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,856
This year, we're introducing a


926
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:07,996
new kind of notification.


927
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:09,426
You can think of it as a


928
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,486
cross-coordinator save


929
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:12,546
notification, but the events are


930
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:13,666
delivered asynchronously.


931
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,776
So the really like


932
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:16,466
cross-coordinator change


933
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:18,196
notifications, we call them


934
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:18,976
remote change notifications.


935
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,326
To turn on remote change


936
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:24,886
notifications, there's a new


937
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,546
PersistentStore option called


938
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:27,986
NSPersistentStore


939
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,276
RemoteChangeNotification


940
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,256
PostOptionKey.


941
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,046
[Chuckles] Set it in your store


942
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:34,316
description before loading the


943
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:35,366
PersistentStore into the


944
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:36,896
coordinator, and the coordinator


945
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:38,656
will listen for remote changes


946
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:39,216
to the store.


947
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:41,416
This option also tells the


948
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,256
coordinator that it should send


949
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:44,646
remote change notifications


950
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:47,296
whenever it makes any changes.


951
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,556
So if you want change


952
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,446
notifications, you want to use


953
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,446
NSPersistentStore RemoteChange


954
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:55,046
NotificationPostOptionKey on all


955
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:57,026
of your coordinators, not just


956
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,256
the ones that want to consume


957
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:58,886
changes.


958
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,926
You also probably want to be


959
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,376
turning on PersistentHistory,


960
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,886
because sure.


961
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,276
Remote change notifications can


962
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:06,586
tell you which store changed


963
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:08,436
with the NSPersistentStore URL


964
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,036
key in the notification's user


965
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,016
info dictionary.


966
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:11,776
But if you have


967
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:12,966
PersistentHistory enabled, it


968
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,176
also includes the new history


969
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:15,126
token created by that


970
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:15,756
transaction.


971
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,956
This is especially useful when


972
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:18,816
combined with the new


973
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:20,246
PersistentHistory fetching


974
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:21,216
features that we were just


975
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:22,436
talking about a second ago.


976
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:24,826
Because remote change


977
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,896
notifications work kind of like


978
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,976
push notifications, sometimes


979
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:30,616
changes make it collapse


980
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,146
together if there are many at


981
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:32,616
once.


982
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:33,616
And only the last would get


983
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:34,026
delivered.


984
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:36,796
If we free launch our app, how


985
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:37,536
do we know what the current


986
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:38,926
PersistentHistory token is?


987
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:40,546
Well, we can get it with a new


988
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:41,656
method on the persistent store


989
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:44,366
coordinator for -- called


990
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,106
CurrentPersistent HistoryToken.


991
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:47,926
All of these new pieces together


992
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,316
can be used to solve puzzles


993
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,096
that weren't possible before.


994
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,506
Not only can we keep up a state


995
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,246
in a timely manner, but


996
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,496
PersistentHistory can also be


997
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:58,096
pared down to only the changes


998
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,086
that affect our work.


999
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:01,946
Now I think the best way to show


1000
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,606
that to you is with another


1001
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:03,956
demo.


1002
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:05,686
So let's see what that looks


1003
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:05,976
like in our app.


1004
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:10,976
So here, we have a controller


1005
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,576
that has the responsibility of


1006
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:13,626
keeping the view context


1007
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:14,596
up-to-date whenever a


1008
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:15,696
coordinator changes.


1009
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:17,616
So we've already registered this


1010
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:20,326
method, storeRemoteChange, to be


1011
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:21,606
called whenever we get a remote


1012
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,626
change notification.


1013
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,256
Once we're in it, we can pull


1014
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,116
out the new PersistentHistory


1015
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:29,626
token that was saved out of the


1016
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:30,676
user info dictionary.


1017
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:32,746
And we'll grab the context that


1018
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,456
we want to update and hop into


1019
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:34,976
perform block.


1020
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:39,486
The first thing we want to do to


1021
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:40,956
reduce the PersistentHistory to


1022
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:42,416
only what we're interested in,


1023
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,876
is to build predicates based on


1024
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:47,556
the last history token we saw,


1025
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:48,786
which in the case of what our


1026
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:49,776
app just launched, was the


1027
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:51,376
current PersistentHistory token.


1028
00:27:52,456 --> 00:27:55,486
And get all transactions before


1029
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:57,266
or equal to the new history


1030
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,396
token that we just got in the


1031
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:58,976
notification.


1032
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:03,706
If we're using transaction


1033
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,606
authors, and we should, then we


1034
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,206
can also create a predicate that


1035
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:08,406
allows us to look at only


1036
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:09,656
transactions that were created


1037
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:10,846
by other coordinators other than


1038
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:10,976
our own.


1039
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:14,796
So then, we can build the


1040
00:28:14,956 --> 00:28:17,086
history fetched requests to get


1041
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,636
transactions, and configure it


1042
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:20,626
with a predicate that's a


1043
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:22,356
compound and predicate of other


1044
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:23,396
predicates we just built.


1045
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:25,436
So now we're only going to get


1046
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,496
transactions authored by other


1047
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:29,266
coordinators between the last


1048
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,376
one we saw, and this new one


1049
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,846
that just got posted inclusive.


1050
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:36,886
We create an NSPersistentHistory


1051
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,376
ChangeRequest, and you configure


1052
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,586
it with this fetched requests


1053
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,266
you've just built, and then


1054
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,606
execute it against the context.


1055
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,596
The result is a list of


1056
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,086
transactions that we're not


1057
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:48,746
up-to-date on.


1058
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,006
So for each of them, we can pull


1059
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,456
out the objectIDNotification


1060
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:55,626
userInfo dictionary, and then


1061
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,226
pass that into the


1062
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:58,956
ManagedObjectContextMethod


1063
00:28:59,066 --> 00:28:59,846
mergeChanges


1064
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:02,646
fromRemoteContextSave, that we


1065
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:03,886
announced in 2017.


1066
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:06,576
Once all the transactions have


1067
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,006
been processed, our view is now


1068
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,106
up-to-date with the latest


1069
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:11,016
on-disk data in the store.


1070
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,316
And it's done in pretty close to


1071
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,386
real time since the push


1072
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,766
notifications locally are very


1073
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:17,256
fast.


1074
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:20,266
Finally, just to make sure we


1075
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,656
don't do any unnecessary work


1076
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,526
next time, we remember the last


1077
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:24,936
PersistentHistory token that we


1078
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:25,636
processed.


1079
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:27,986
And now, we're ready for another


1080
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:28,946
remote change notification.


1081
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:32,286
Alright, and that is


1082
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,686
PersistentHistory fetching and


1083
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:35,926
remote change notifications.


1084
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:39,606
[ Applause ]


1085
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:42,286
Ah, finally, I wanted to spend a


1086
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,346
bit of time talking about


1087
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:43,796
testing.


1088
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,696
While hopefully everyone here is


1089
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:47,986
running their tests in multiple


1090
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,936
configurations with desanitizers


1091
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:51,536
as well as in release, I wanted


1092
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:52,586
to start some advice that


1093
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:53,936
focuses a bit more on Core Data.


1094
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,236
Number one is to know what your


1095
00:29:57,236 --> 00:29:58,166
performance goals are.


1096
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,306
A Contacts app should be testing


1097
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:01,896
with at least tens of thousands


1098
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:02,626
of objects.


1099
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:03,976
But with that kind of


1100
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,136
performance goal, a linear


1101
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,276
algorithm might actually be


1102
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:07,776
acceptable on desktop hardware


1103
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:08,676
some of the time.


1104
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:10,826
The Photos app, on the other


1105
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:11,826
hand, should have tested to


1106
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:12,856
validate everything works


1107
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:13,496
correctly when there are


1108
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:14,966
millions of objects.


1109
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:16,806
At that scale, anything slower


1110
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:18,026
than logarithmic time is enough


1111
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,836
to hang the app.


1112
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:21,326
And so it's really important to


1113
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,236
test like you fly by running all


1114
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,136
of your integration tests with


1115
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:24,976
the performance data set.


1116
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,846
But the integration tests should


1117
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,266
also get running configurations


1118
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,576
optimized for detecting and


1119
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:34,096
surfacing other kinds of issues


1120
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:34,606
as well.


1121
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,406
For applications using Core


1122
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:37,676
Data, that should include taking


1123
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:38,596
advantage of the Framework's


1124
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:40,006
built-in concurrency debugging.


1125
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,206
You can enable it by going into


1126
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,546
the Scheme Editor and setting


1127
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,296
com.apple.CoreData


1128
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,316
ConcurrencyDebugged1 in the


1129
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:49,386
process arguments list.


1130
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,336
Running integration tests in


1131
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:54,856
multiple configurations can take


1132
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,776
a lot of time.


1133
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,426
And likewise, unit tests need to


1134
00:30:57,426 --> 00:30:58,576
be as fast as possible.


1135
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,096
So it's good idea to use


1136
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,856
in-memory stores when test


1137
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:04,136
runtime is important.


1138
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:06,426
In this case, I specifically


1139
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:08,436
mean the SqLightStores in-memory


1140
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:08,786
mode.


1141
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,136
SqLightStore has long supported


1142
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:12,916
in-memory mode.


1143
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,866
To take advantage of it, in


1144
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,026
between creating a persistent


1145
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:16,976
container and loading its


1146
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,136
stores, we can pull out the


1147
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:19,516
store description and set its


1148
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:20,756
URL property to point to


1149
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:20,976
dev/null.


1150
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,356
This creates an extremely


1151
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:25,436
performance stack.


1152
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:27,186
But this in-memory store can't


1153
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,956
be shared between coordinators.


1154
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:31,066
So to validate all that remote


1155
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,506
change notification work we just


1156
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,296
did, we want to take advantage


1157
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:35,706
of named in-memory stores


1158
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:36,206
instead.


1159
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:38,676
A named in-memory store is


1160
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:39,836
defined by adding a path


1161
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,396
component after dev/null.


1162
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,826
And any other SqLightStore with


1163
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,906
that URL in the same process


1164
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:46,556
will connect to the shared


1165
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:46,976
in-memory database.


1166
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:51,106
Different coordinators sharing


1167
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:52,456
the same in-memory store will


1168
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:53,926
also dispatch remote change


1169
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:54,986
notifications to each other,


1170
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:55,686
which allows us to test all of


1171
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:55,976
our logic.


1172
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:01,066
Finally, use the sanitizers.


1173
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:02,866
Each of these has saved me at


1174
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,056
least once.


1175
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,786
I've seen the trust sanitizer


1176
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:07,256
instantly identify a one byte


1177
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,986
buffer overflow that would have


1178
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:10,206
taken months to isolate.


1179
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:12,696
Similarly, thread sanitizer


1180
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,296
understands critical sections


1181
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:15,726
and can tell you about threading


1182
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,056
races that are impossible to


1183
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:18,126
reproduce in-house.


1184
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:21,106
And finally, UBSan lets you fix


1185
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:22,326
bugs before they happen by


1186
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,276
identifying undefined behavior


1187
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,456
that may change in the future.


1188
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,656
So today we've seen how to get


1189
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,576
set up with Core Data, about how


1190
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:30,986
to take advantage of new and


1191
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,976
existing APIs to write compact,


1192
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,046
seamless, and robust integration


1193
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,236
between the model and controller


1194
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:36,736
layers.


1195
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,666
We've explored keeping things in


1196
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:39,666
sync between multiple


1197
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,186
coordinators, and we've


1198
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:42,336
characterized our needs and


1199
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,306
written tests around them, so we


1200
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:43,976
can ship with more confidence.


1201
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:47,946
As always, we'd love to hear


1202
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,266
what you think, so please let us


1203
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,496
know using Feedback Assistant.


1204
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:53,296
For more information, please


1205
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:54,546
check out the developer website.


1206
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:56,666
This session's page will include


1207
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,856
links to the other sessions


1208
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,746
mentioned here today.


1209
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:00,456
We'll see you in the labs


1210
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:01,116
tomorrow.


1211
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:01,926
Thanks for coming.
