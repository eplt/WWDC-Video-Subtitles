00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,506
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:10,946
>> Dave Van Tassell:
OK, good morning.


3
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,976
Welcome to iTunes Connect,


4
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:16,286
What's New in iTunes
Connect [applause].


5
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,236
I'm Dave Van Tassell,


6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,146
Engineering Manager,
iTunes Connect.


7
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:20,836
Let's get started.


8
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:26,676
This year, we are excited to
go over three new features


9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,616
that are some of the more
highly requested features


10
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:29,776
from you for us.


11
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:33,766
First one is enhanced score
and leaderboard management.


12
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,616
Second, app transfer.


13
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:38,226
[Cheering and applause] Yes.


14
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,446
Third, enhanced command
line automation.


15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,486
And then at the end
we want to go


16
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:46,116
over some App Review
dos and don'ts.


17
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,716
OK, score management,
what is this?


18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,456
Well, let's look at some high
scores from different games.


19
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:56,006
Angry Birds Star Wars
let's take a look here.


20
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,336
We can see the highest
score for their total game.


21
00:00:58,336 --> 00:00:59,526
That's a good score.


22
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,906
What about Harry Potter.


23
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:06,276
Let's see here, this is the
number of studs collected,


24
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,556
and Hogwarts has
never looked so clean.


25
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,776
Now, we have Scrabble.


26
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:17,456
This is the most wins, and
you must really love your iPad


27
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,656
to play that many games.


28
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,846
So, what do all these
scores have in common?


29
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,666
This is a big number.


30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,236
I got to be honest, I didn't
know exactly what it is


31
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:29,516
in English.


32
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:30,966
I had to look it
up 9 quintillion.


33
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,996
Most of you in this room should
be thinking to yourselves,


34
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,396
I've seen that number, I
know what that number is,


35
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,016
it looks familiar, Max
Int, something like that.


36
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,516
So these high scores,
are they high scores?


37
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,816
Or, are they unearned scores?


38
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,366
I think people have
been cheating.


39
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,356
So, how do we prevent this?


40
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,916
Well, at iTunes Connect,
we have score range.


41
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,576
You can enter in a
min and a max score,


42
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:58,136
and if any score is posted
outside of that range,


43
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,636
then we don't post it to the
Game Center leaderboards.


44
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:03,646
New this year is score signing


45
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,416
to help make those
scores more safe.


46
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:09,436
And, there was some information,


47
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:10,786
there was a Game Center
session yesterday,


48
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,116
and there's another one today to
talk more about those features


49
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,666
and enhancements we've
made with both of them.


50
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:16,506
But that's great.


51
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,076
How do we fix these
existing scores?


52
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,606
Well, that's what leaderboard
score management is all about.


53
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,046
Exactly what it is, you
log into iTunes Connect,


54
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,456
and you click on a leaderboard.


55
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,036
Once you do that, you
want to manage the scores.


56
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,736
You'll be presented with the top
100 scores for that leaderboard.


57
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,656
You can choose at that point to
either delete the invalid score,


58
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,936
or you can block a user and
all their invalid scores.


59
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:42,586
So, let's focus on
deleting a score right now.


60
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:45,496
What this does, it just removes
the score from the leaderboard.


61
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:50,026
And the user is able
to play the game again


62
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,066
and post another score,


63
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,296
and hopefully this
time a real score,


64
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,126
and it will show
up on Game Center.


65
00:02:55,696 --> 00:03:01,296
No other leaderboards
are affected by this.


66
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:02,226
Blocking a user.


67
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,936
This will remove the score
not only from that leaderboard


68
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,386
but all leaderboards
on your app.


69
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,786
Not only is the score deleted,
but the user is then blocked


70
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,396
from posting any new
scores for that leaderboard


71
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,446
and all the leaderboards
on your app.


72
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:19,826
If your app happens
to be grouped,


73
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,446
then the same thing applies


74
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,736
to all the leaderboards
in that group.


75
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,486
The scores are wiped from all
the leaderboards in that group,


76
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:28,576
and they are blocked from
posting any new scores


77
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,396
to those leaderboards.


78
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,666
So, that's leaderboard
score management.


79
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:38,316
You can delete unearned scores,
you can block the cheaters.


80
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,466
It's a great way to
offer customer service


81
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:45,096
to your customers, and it will
be available later this year.


82
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,706
But I'm going to remind you,


83
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,956
with great power comes
great responsibility.


84
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,486
And, I think you know
where I'm going with this.


85
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,146
These are your customers;
they're our customers.


86
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,786
Let's treat them fairly and
with the respect they're due.


87
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:01,536
So that's score management.


88
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,006
Let's talk a little


89
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:05,216
about leaderboard
management, leaderboard sets.


90
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,686
If you attended yesterday's
Game Center session or played


91
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:09,076
around a little on
iTunes Connect this week,


92
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,166
you've seen leaderboard sets.


93
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,056
And what this is, is a way to
collect similar leaderboards


94
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,566
and give them a common
name, a shared icon.


95
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,346
It gives you better
leaderboard navigation.


96
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:21,446
We're also giving
you the ability


97
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,426
to have a display
name localization,


98
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,266
so each leaderboard can have
a custom name in these sets.


99
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,906
And the great thing


100
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,196
about leaderboard
sets is you're allowed


101
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,406
to have 500 leaderboards
per app.


102
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,176
So, we talked about
leaderboards today.


103
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,366
So, we have our Touch Fighter
2 game with four leaderboards.


104
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,456
They kind of just flow
down in front of the user


105
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:39,256
when they go to Game Center.


106
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,296
Level 1 High Score,
Level 1 Fastest Time.


107
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,686
Level 2 High Score,
Level 2 Fastest Time.


108
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:48,766
What we want to do now is create
a couple of sets for them.


109
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,146
So, we'll take those first
two Level 1 leaderboards


110
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,636
and create a set called Level 1.


111
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,836
Take the second two
leaderboards of Level 2,


112
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,246
and there they go
into Level 2 set.


113
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,726
Talk about display
name localization.


114
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,676
Again, we have these
four leaderboards.


115
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:04,826
We create our set.


116
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:08,346
Level 1 High Score can rename
to just High Score in this set.


117
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,806
Level 1 Fastest Time
is just Fastest Time,


118
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:12,976
similar to the Level 2 set.


119
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:15,936
Take their High Score and
Fastest Time leaderboards


120
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:17,326
and then you get
the display name


121
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:18,916
of High Score and Fastest Time.


122
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,986
And if we introduced a third
set where you mix and match,


123
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:25,586
we can change that Level 1 High
Score now has a display name


124
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,346
of just Level 1.


125
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:33,386
Level 2 High Score,
display name of Level 2.


126
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,066
Again, leaderboard
sets: The great thing


127
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:38,856
about it is 500 leaderboards
per game, and you can mix it --


128
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,996
you can put your leaderboards
in as many sets as you want.


129
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:45,146
However, once you do put
your leaderboards into a set,


130
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:46,076
then all of your leaderboards


131
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,306
in your app will
need to be in a set.


132
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,226
There's no mixing and matching.


133
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,416
This works for both grouped
and non-grouped games.


134
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,816
You add your localization
in iTunes Connect,


135
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,566
and it is available
in sandbox mode today.


136
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,636
With that, I'd like
to turn the time


137
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,426
over to Daniel Miao
[phonetic] to give us a demo


138
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,926
of this feature in
iTunes Connect.


139
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,636
>> Daniel Miao: My
name is Daniel.


140
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,316
I'm an engineer on
iTunes Connect.


141
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:11,576
And, now that you've heard about
some of the new features we have


142
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,626
in iTunes Connect,
let's take a closer look


143
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,306
at leaderboard sets
and score management.


144
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:24,156
So, here we have the
Touch Fighter 2 app page.


145
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,196
We're going to go into the
Manage Game Center Flow.


146
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:32,806
And many of you will recognize
this page as where you go to set


147
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,166
up your leaderboards
and achievements.


148
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,756
Now, you'll notice we
have two new buttons here.


149
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:40,856
Move All Leaderboards into Sets
and Manage Scores and Players.


150
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,786
For the purposes of this demo,


151
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,256
we have four leaderboards
set up.


152
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,136
We have two Level 1 leaderboards
and two Level 2 leaderboards.


153
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,296
We're going to go ahead and add
these into two leaderboard sets,


154
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,026
one for Level 1,
and one for Level 2.


155
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:57,226
So, in order to start
this process,


156
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,646
we're going to click
Move All Leaderboards


157
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,036
into Sets, right here.


158
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:04,476
And this page is asking us what
we'd like to call our first set.


159
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:07,716
So, let's go ahead
and call that Level 1.


160
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:14,876
Then we'll give it an ID of
Touch Fighter Set Level 1.


161
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:16,856
Click Continue.


162
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:19,966
And here on this page, we'll see


163
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,416
that so far we have
one set created,


164
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,086
and we're currently
editing it, the Level 1 set.


165
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,386
And we'll go ahead and add
a leaderboard to this set.


166
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,126
So we'll click Add
to Display Set.


167
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:32,066
We'll choose a leaderboard.


168
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:36,546
In this case, we'll
choose Level 1 High Score


169
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,716
and give it an English
display name.


170
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:43,346
We'll just call it High Score.


171
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,466
Now, as Dave had mentioned,


172
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,466
display names designate what
we'd like this leaderboard


173
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,756
to show up as, inside
of this set.


174
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:56,486
So, in a Level 1 set, the Level
1 High Score leaderboard will


175
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:59,806
show up as just High Score,
so Level 1 High Score.


176
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,766
So hit Save and save this
leaderboard to this set.


177
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,486
Then we'll go ahead and
add our second leaderboard.


178
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,116
We'll choose Level
1 Fastest Time,


179
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,506
add an English display
name again.


180
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:22,706
We'll just call this
one Fastest Time.


181
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,306
Now we'll add a localization
for this set.


182
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:29,836
We'll choose English.


183
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:34,246
And we'll just call this
one Level 1 in English.


184
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:37,256
And there's also an optional
image that you can add


185
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,426
to these leaderboard sets.


186
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:42,066
We'll hit Save to save
this localization.


187
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,576
And now we're finished
setting up our Level 1 set.


188
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,606
So, let's add our Level 2 set.


189
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,066
Click Add Display Set.


190
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,616
Call this one Level 2.


191
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:54,806
Give an ID.


192
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,456
Hit Save to create it.


193
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,566
And we'll see up here that
now we have both Level 1


194
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:06,026
and Level 2, and as you create
more sets, they'll be listed


195
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,246
out here and you can switch
between them to edit them


196
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,476
at any time during this process.


197
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,766
So, on our Level 2 leaderboards
now, we'll click Add


198
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:17,766
to Display Set, and the first
thing you'll notice here is


199
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,796
that now we have two sections
now; one for leaderboards not


200
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,536
in a set, and one for
leaderboards in a set.


201
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:25,476
As Dave had mentioned earlier,
if you're moving leaderboards


202
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,226
into sets, all your
leaderboards have to be moved.


203
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,816
You can't have some
leaderboards in a set


204
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,256
and some leaderboards
not in a set.


205
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,706
So, this helps us to track
which leaderboards we have


206
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,916
yet to move before we can finish
this initial migration process.


207
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,256
So here we'll move our
Level 2 High Score.


208
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:44,996
Add an English display
name again.


209
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,786
Call it High Score.


210
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:53,516
And then we'll add our
second Level 2 leaderboard.


211
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:00,266
Choose an English display name.


212
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,106
Call it Fastest Time.


213
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:07,156
And now all our leaderboards
have been added to sets.


214
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,336
Now, we'll add a language.


215
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:18,396
In English, we'll
call this Level 2.


216
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,596
And now we're finished.


217
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,636
We've added all our
leaderboards into sets,


218
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,416
and we have our two sets
with four leaderboards.


219
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:26,956
So hit "Save" in order
to complete this process.


220
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,486
And we'll see that
we have our two sets,


221
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,466
and we still have the
four leaderboards below.


222
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:36,126
And if we want to preview which
leaderboards are in which sets,


223
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:38,286
we click View Leaderboards
in Display Sets, right here.


224
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:44,216
And we'll see here that we
have two Level 2 leaderboards


225
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:47,606
in a Level 2 set, and two Level
1 leaderboards in a Level 1 set.


226
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,426
And of course you can put
each leaderboard into more


227
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:50,886
than one set as you go on.


228
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:53,626
So those are leaderboard sets.


229
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,036
So we're going to go
ahead and take a look


230
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:57,556
at To Manage Scores
and Players now.


231
00:10:57,786 --> 00:11:00,656
In order to do that, we
click this button right here.


232
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:05,446
And this brings up a list
of our live leaderboards.


233
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,366
From here, let's say we want
to take a look at the scores


234
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,566
in Level 1 High Score.


235
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,286
Click Manage.


236
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:15,796
And we have five
scores posted so far.


237
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,926
Now, this first player,
we'll notice,


238
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,956
has a score of course
that's way too high


239
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,286
to be achievable in this game.


240
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,796
And not only is it
on this leaderboard,


241
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,956
but we've seen this player post
it across all our leaderboards,


242
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,966
and even on other
games that we publish.


243
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,706
So what we'd like to do is --


244
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,966
obviously, there's an
abuse of the system here,


245
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:36,256
so we'd like to block
this player


246
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:38,926
and clear all of his scores.


247
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:43,746
So, in order to do that, we
click Block, we confirm that,


248
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,496
and now his score is gone
from this leaderboard


249
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,096
and all the leaderboards
in our game,


250
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,346
and he can no longer
post any scores


251
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:51,986
to the leaderboards
in this game.


252
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:56,206
Now, the second player,
who's now in the first spot,


253
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,156
also has a score
that's too high,


254
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,346
but this one's not his fault.


255
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,326
This one's due to the
fact that we had a bug


256
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,476
in our game a few versions ago


257
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:07,326
that was having trouble
calculating scores properly and,


258
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,266
you know, a few of the scores
slipped through and ended


259
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,606
up being posted to
the leaderboards.


260
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,426
So we'd like to clean
this one up.


261
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,316
So what we'll do here is
we'll just click Remove


262
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,926
and remove that one.


263
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:20,726
And that specifically
removes that score


264
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,926
from this leaderboard, but this
player can continue posting


265
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,746
and playing this game as usual.


266
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:30,036
And now we have a clean
leaderboard with fair scores,


267
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,586
and our players are happy
because now they can compete


268
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,646
on the same playing field.


269
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:36,776
And that's score management.


270
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:43,106
So, we hope that you enjoy these
new features, and I'm going


271
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:43,886
to hand it back to Dave.


272
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,256
And thank you.


273
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:48,006
>> Dave Van Tassell:
OK, thank you, Daniel.


274
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,956
So that was score and
leaderboard management.


275
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,596
Next, let's move
on to App Transfer.


276
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,126
So this is a story
many of you know.


277
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,716
You create your app.


278
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,016
It's on the App Store.


279
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:03,726
It's doing very well and now
you -- somebody wants to buy it.


280
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,746
So, how do you do that?


281
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,076
Well, we thought this
was a good idea as well,


282
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,966
so here's our blue button
from iTunes Connect.


283
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,246
What we did is we
managed to just push them


284
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,026
down a little bit, leaving
a little bit of space,


285
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,466
and then we put Transfer App.


286
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,266
But what does this actually do?


287
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,566
Basically, App Transfer
changes ownership


288
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:25,466
from one developer to another.


289
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:28,766
It's fairly -- it's
transparent for your user.


290
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,896
In fact, the customer
reviews and the ratings,


291
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,826
they actually go
with the ownership


292
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:35,586
of the app to the new owner.


293
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,796
The App Store has
very minimal changes.


294
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,776
That developer name in that
upper left-hand corner,


295
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:43,096
hat will change,
as well as the URL,


296
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,876
support privacy marketing URLs.


297
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:49,386
In Game Center, if you are
using cross-app compatibility,


298
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:51,876
then we will move that
compatibility with other apps


299
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:52,936
as part of the transfer.


300
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,816
And if your app is grouped, then
it will be ungrouped and put


301
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,686
in with the new owner as
a stand-alone game again.


302
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:03,556
The app ID is also transferred.


303
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:06,386
And even though the app itself
transfers from one developer


304
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:10,716
to another, that 10-character
prefix, which is the team ID


305
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,496
of the original owner,
transfers with the app ID


306
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,546
into your member center.


307
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:16,906
So, let's take a
look at the flow.


308
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,016
You're the current owner.


309
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:20,116
You log into iTunes Connect.


310
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,426
You're going to give
us some new information


311
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,066
about who the new owner
is so that we know


312
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,466
who to transfer the app to.


313
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:28,976
At this point, you need
to sign a contract,


314
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,876
and this is a good time to tell
you that it will be need --


315
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,926
it will need to be the
team agent who does this,


316
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,796
as they will have the
rights to sign contracts.


317
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:40,036
Once they do this, our app
is pending app transfer,


318
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:43,096
and the new owner will receive
an email letting him know this


319
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,266
transfer process has started.


320
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:47,316
They too log into
iTunes Connect.


321
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:50,736
They enter in the required
metadata to be able


322
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,346
to transfer the app,
those URLs and so forth


323
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,076
that we were talking about.


324
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,716
And, again, this same person
needs to be a team agent,


325
00:14:57,716 --> 00:15:00,456
as they will need to sign an app
transfer contract on their end.


326
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,186
Once they do that, we begin
to process the app transfer.


327
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:09,046
Once we transfer this app from
provider to the next provider,


328
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,196
off it goes to the new owner.


329
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:14,026
A couple of rules for
the current owner:


330
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,946
You need to make sure all of
your contracts are up-to-date.


331
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,346
We've just released new
contracts this week;


332
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:21,866
I encourage you to go sign them
for this and for every reason


333
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:22,646
to get your apps on the store.


334
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,326
You do need to have
approved app version.


335
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,696
If your app has never been
approved, is not on the store,


336
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:28,916
there's no reason to go
through App Transfer.


337
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,436
And also, if you have any
updates that are in review,


338
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,046
get them through the
review queue before you try


339
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:35,656
to transfer the app.


340
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,976
Same thing for In-App purchases;
if you have any In-App purchases


341
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:42,086
that are currently in
review, they need to be


342
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:46,246
through the review queue
before you transfer the app.


343
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,216
What you need to bring.


344
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,966
Like I said, you
need the Apple ID


345
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:51,646
of the recipient's team agent.


346
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:55,336
And you'll also need
the recipient's team ID,


347
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,326
which is that unique
ID that everybody has,


348
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:58,516
and you can find it
in the Member Center.


349
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,216
Once you transfer the
app, it will no longer be


350
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,336
in iTunes Connect, so any app
history that you want to get,


351
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:08,296
you need to download that
before you transfer the app.


352
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,496
If you want a new catalog
report with that information,


353
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,406
do that before you
transfer the app.


354
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:16,176
The source code and
binary is not handled


355
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:17,496
through the app transfer
process;


356
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:18,806
you need to make
special arrangements


357
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:24,136
between the two developers
on how to do that.


358
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:28,106
Once the app transfer is
begun, you are allowed


359
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,216
to change the price of
your app, you're allowed


360
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:32,036
to change the price of
in-app purchases; however,


361
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,456
the rest of the metadata
is locked down.


362
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:36,746
And you have 60 days to
complete the transfer.


363
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:41,276
Either the new owner or the
current owner can cancel it


364
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,786
at this time; however, after
60 days, if it hasn't finished,


365
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:46,476
then you'll have to
start all over again.


366
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:51,056
For the new owner,
what's their checklist?


367
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,076
We need that new app metadata.


368
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:57,336
We also need to know who to
contact if we have questions


369
00:16:57,336 --> 00:17:00,106
about the app: Name,
phone number, email,


370
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,446
those fields you see
in iTunes Connect.


371
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,576
If your app uses encryption


372
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,816
and export compliance
documentation is required,


373
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,976
you will need to have that
before you can sign the contract


374
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:10,695
that transfers the app.


375
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:15,356
At this point, once you've
signed your contract,


376
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:18,175
App Transfer has begun, it's
processing App Transfer,


377
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:21,036
the pricing is locked down,
and it cannot be canceled.


378
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,526
The app will begin to move
from the current owner


379
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,806
over to the new owner,
and then it shows


380
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,016
up in the new owner's
iTunes Connect.


381
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:33,596
You have a few steps to take.


382
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,716
If you are the new owner, once
this app has been transferred,


383
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,126
there's a couple things to do.


384
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:40,146
If the app makes use of Apple
Push Notification Service,


385
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:42,316
then you'll need to log
into your Member Center


386
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,876
and provision the newly
transferred app ID


387
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:45,846
for the service.


388
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,966
Also, if the app uses
Keychain, you need to discuss


389
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,736
with the previous owner
how they did that,


390
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:54,356
as when you update the app with
a new version, it won't be able


391
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:57,576
to access that same data.


392
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:00,486
That is App Transfer.


393
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,096
It's available today,
and we're very excited


394
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:03,656
to see how you use it.


395
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,236
[applause] Dave: With that,
I'm going to turn the time


396
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:06,286
over to Nick Oogloff
[phonetic] to talk


397
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,876
about our automation
enhancements.


398
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,656
>> Nik: I'm Nik Uglov,
Engineering Manager,


399
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:13,606
iTunes Store, Content
Management.


400
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,326
As Dave said, I'm going to talk


401
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:20,106
about command line
automation with Transporter.


402
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:22,676
Well, what is it?


403
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:23,846
What's in it for you?


404
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:24,676
Why should you care?


405
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,786
With command line
automation with Transporter,


406
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,936
you will be able to address your
most repetitive interactions


407
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,296
with iTunes Connect
without having


408
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:36,346
to go through the web GUI.


409
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:39,826
You will be able to
manage your data in bulk,


410
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:43,646
and you can integrate
that management --


411
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,446
you can integrate
iTunes Connect --


412
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,526
with your backend content
management systems,


413
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,366
whatever those may be.


414
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:54,206
Ultimately, it's
about being efficient


415
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:55,966
in publishing your
app on the store.


416
00:18:56,326 --> 00:19:00,316
And the time savings that you
gain, you'll be able to reinvest


417
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:03,136
into making your
apps even better.


418
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,166
So, I'm going to introduce
a command line tool called


419
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,176
Transporter, which
manages the interaction


420
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:12,676
between your environment
and iTunes Connect.


421
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:16,406
And it does that by using
an app metadata XML feed.


422
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:21,156
The feed covers the areas of
version level localization,


423
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,346
rights and pricing for your
app, the in-app purchases


424
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,546
and Game Center achievements
and leaderboards.


425
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:30,616
Through Transporter, you can
also get your catalog reports


426
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,116
on a command line.


427
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:36,166
So, let's start by reviewing
how you currently edit this data


428
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,926
in iTunes Connect.


429
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:40,056
This is the screen that
you usually go to for this,


430
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:44,296
and there are seven fields
to fill in, and there are


431
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,426
up to five screenshots
per device type


432
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,976
that you support to supply.


433
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:50,516
It certainly pays to
supply multiple screenshots


434
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,236
to show your app in the
most advantageous light.


435
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,486
Also, the stores available
in up to 28 languages,


436
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,096
so in order to appeal
most effectively


437
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:05,286
to your customers worldwide, it
pays to provide that information


438
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,776
in the language that
they can understand.


439
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:09,806
So, there are up to 28
screens like that to fill in.


440
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:13,516
And a lot of you have
multiple apps to maintain,


441
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:17,456
which is wonderful, but
it increases your burden


442
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:21,596
in providing all that data.


443
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,806
The GUI as it stands is
fine for a few items.


444
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,846
In fact, that's the most
efficient way to fill


445
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,426
in this information if all
you are doing is changing a


446
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,946
description here and
there, adding a screenshot.


447
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:38,046
But as you scale up to multiple
localizations and multiple apps,


448
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,346
this gets burdensome, and
it could be error-prone,


449
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:44,736
because you're probably
copying this data --


450
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,276
copy-pasting it from some
document somebody put together.


451
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,846
You probably don't know
all of the 28 languages.


452
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,256
Some of you maybe do,
but probably not all.


453
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,646
So, you could make a
mistake in this copy-paste.


454
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:58,346
And ultimately, you can't
automate this process,


455
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:01,716
because you can't script
the Web GUI effectively.


456
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,236
You've been telling us about
it; you've been filing a lot


457
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:08,186
of bug reports, and we
certainly read them.


458
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:14,476
In fact, last year, we
introduced an XML feed


459
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,356
that covers a portion
of that interaction.


460
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,166
It covers the areas
of In-App purchases,


461
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,686
Game Center leaderboards,
and Game Center achievements.


462
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,956
Well, today, today
we're introducing --


463
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,876
we're building on top
of that foundation


464
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:30,926
and introducing support for
version-level localization


465
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:34,446
in a version section,
pricing and availability,


466
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:38,466
and in the in-app purchase
area, we're also allowing you


467
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:42,866
to upload the hosted content
packages that you can produce


468
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:46,596
with Xcode, through the feed.


469
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:47,856
Let's review the features.


470
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,326
What's available there?


471
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:52,656
Well, first and foremost
there is Transporter,


472
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:55,566
which is a command-line tool
for managing this interaction.


473
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:59,386
And the first thing you
do with it is you look


474
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,636
up the current state, the
current metadata for your app.


475
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,226
When you do that, it gets
downloaded as a package,


476
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:08,396
which is really just a fancy
name for a directory named


477
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,296
after the app's SKU
with a .itmsp extension.


478
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,296
You crack it open -- crack
that directory open --


479
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,696
and what you find in there is
a file called metadata.xml,


480
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,856
and that encapsulates
current state of your data


481
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,696
in iTunes Connect,
the data for your app.


482
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,836
This is the file
that you need to edit


483
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:29,206
to make changes to your app.


484
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:33,426
You edit it to your heart's
content, and then any assets


485
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:37,346
that need to go with it, let's
say screenshots, you park them


486
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:39,556
in the same directory, right
next to that metadata.xml.


487
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,176
You build up the
package this way,


488
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,656
and then you can validate it.


489
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:48,966
Validation, as a
separate action,


490
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:51,266
is optional because you could
just go ahead and upload it,


491
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:55,196
and the validation will also
be performed when you do that.


492
00:22:55,406 --> 00:23:00,346
This is the lifecycle, the flow
overall: download the package;


493
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:05,706
modify XML; add screenshots and
other assets; do the validation,


494
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:07,506
either by itself or as
a part of the upload;


495
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:10,966
if there are any errors, you
address them by editing XML


496
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,866
and changing the
assets as needed;


497
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,686
and ultimately you
upload the package.


498
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,326
It gets to iTunes Connect,
and you have your data there.


499
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:22,226
Here's the first
command you need to know:


500
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:25,696
Transporter with a
method "lookup metadata".


501
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:30,406
You provide your iTunes Connect
username and the vendor ID


502
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,136
for your app, which
is your app's SKU.


503
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:35,246
That's the same thing:
App's SKU is the vendor ID.


504
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,166
You provide the local
destination folder where you'd


505
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,776
like the package to end
up, and what happens,


506
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:48,076
it gets downloaded
locally as a package named


507
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,286
after the app's SKU
with a .itmsp extension.


508
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:52,726
And the reason you want
to go with this first,


509
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:54,846
the reason to do the
lookup and not the upload is


510
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:58,006
so that you wouldn't have to
come up with this big XML file


511
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,166
with everything about your
app in there, from scratch.


512
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:03,556
You could use this as a skeleton
to bootstrap your automation.


513
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:05,506
It's a lot easier this way.


514
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:09,546
Next up is validation
with Transporter.


515
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,886
Use the "verify" method, supply
your iTunes Connect username


516
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,816
and the name of the package
that you're validating.


517
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:21,776
What happens then is we validate
both the metadata and the assets


518
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:23,816
that you're providing,


519
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,716
and we validate them using the
same rules that are applied


520
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,566
in iTunes Connect,
same conditions.


521
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:31,216
If there are any errors
during that process,


522
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:34,036
you get them reported to
you on a command line.


523
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:34,876
Here's an example.


524
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:38,826
"No software found with
vendor ID 'bogus'."


525
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:42,426
Well, not surprising, given
the vendor ID I chose.


526
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:45,026
What is it that we validate?


527
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:47,796
Well, quite a lot; there's
a lot of validations.


528
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:50,456
I wouldn't be able to go through
all of them here in the session,


529
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,226
but you can take a look in the
documentation, which I'll point


530
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,366
out to you in a few minutes.


531
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,426
But to kind of give
you a flavor:


532
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:59,966
you have to identify your
app properly by the SKU;


533
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,776
the version needs to be
in an editable state --


534
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:05,836
if it's currently in
review, you can't modify it,


535
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:09,556
same goes for in-app
purchases; the screenshots need


536
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:10,666
to be appropriate dimensions --


537
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,496
the same ones that
iTunes Connect requires.


538
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:18,236
Next up, Transporter
"upload" method.


539
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:21,116
That's the one that actually
sends the data to us.


540
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:26,326
You supply your iTunes Connect
user ID, supply the name


541
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:28,326
of the package to upload.


542
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:33,066
What happens here is the same
validation is performed that's


543
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,066
in the verification step,
and the same, ultimately,


544
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,756
rules as in iTunes Connect.


545
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:40,876
If there are any
errors, they are reported


546
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:41,806
to you on the command line.


547
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,856
If everything went fine,


548
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:47,306
what happens is the
package gets uploaded to us,


549
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:50,896
and it enters an asynchronous
processing queue that's shared


550
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,266
between all the content
that we process.


551
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:58,846
That would be music, movies,
and books, and other software.


552
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,416
You could expect there
to be a few minutes


553
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,636
of delay before your data
is actually reflected


554
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:05,376
in iTunes Connect.


555
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,386
There is actually another
mode in Transporter


556
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:11,156
that would let you
look up the status


557
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:12,696
of your most recent
upload; you can take a look


558
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,686
at that in documentation.


559
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:19,016
A few other details
before I move on.


560
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:24,696
The app and the version need to
already exist in iTunes Connect.


561
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,366
You set them up in iTunes
Connect as you do now,


562
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,086
sort of in a skeletal
shape, if you will,


563
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,446
and then you can use the
feed to populate them


564
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:33,586
with all the rich information.


565
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,746
All the state transitions are
managed in iTunes Connect:


566
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:40,256
let's say if you're
moving the app to ready


567
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,246
to upload the binary,


568
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:48,706
or submitting the in-app
purchases for a review.


569
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:50,896
When you're ready to upload
that binary, you still do


570
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:53,956
that with Xcode or Application
Loader, no changes there.


571
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,036
And the feed is available


572
00:26:57,036 --> 00:26:59,866
for both iOS apps
and Mac apps equally.


573
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:04,376
I mentioned documentation
a little earlier.


574
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,816
This is where you'll find
it: on iTunes Connect


575
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,966
in Manage Your Apps
screen on the bottom.


576
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,266
There are two pieces of
information you need:


577
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,846
the Transporter User Guide,


578
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:16,486
which lists all the commands
I'm going to go through today


579
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,666
in a lot more detail,
and there's more of them.


580
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:23,326
And the App Metadata XML
specification, which that's


581
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:24,856
where all of the tags are listed


582
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,626
with all the requirements
that apply to them.


583
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:33,746
This was a general introduction
to Transporter and an overview


584
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,496
of the app metadata XML feed.


585
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:38,376
Well, what does the XML
feed actually look like?


586
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:39,126
What do you see there?


587
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:42,796
It looks something like this.


588
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:45,596
You have the required
elements that kind


589
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:46,656
of wrap everything else.


590
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:51,946
And what you have there is you
have a package for your account,


591
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,676
which is identified by team ID.


592
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,566
The package contains software.


593
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:59,396
The software is for the specific
app, identified by vendor ID,


594
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:00,306
which is the app's SKU.


595
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,276
And within it the metadata.


596
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:05,736
Those are required elements.


597
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,056
The rest of the stuff here,


598
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:10,116
the rest of the sections,
are optional.


599
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:14,036
Well, what exactly
do I mean by that?


600
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,336
What I mean is that if
you're not making changes


601
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:19,816
to some component there,
you could omit that.


602
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,306
If you're not making
changes in Game Center,


603
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:23,416
you can omit the entire section.


604
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,626
Not making changes In-App
purchases, omit that.


605
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:30,196
I don't mean that
you must omit it.


606
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:34,506
If you just did a metadata
lookup, made a few changes,


607
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,996
you could just re-upload
the package as-is,


608
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:39,226
and if there are no changes
in certain sections, well,


609
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,746
no changes will occur
in iTunes Connect.


610
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,506
All I'm saying is it's
optional to include the sections


611
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,326
that don't have any changes.


612
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:49,446
Let's dive in.


613
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:54,936
First thing in the package is
you need to specify your account


614
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:58,266
by team ID, which is a value
that's been provided previously


615
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:58,866
to you by Apple.


616
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,596
And in the software section,
you have to identify,


617
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:03,736
well, what app is it for?


618
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:05,596
And that's done by
the vendor ID,


619
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,396
which is the same
as the app's SKU.


620
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,186
That's exactly the same value.


621
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,076
Diving in, into the
software metadata section,


622
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:17,396
what you'll find there is
the versions for your app.


623
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:18,876
And just like in iTunes Connect,


624
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:22,226
there are up two versions
that you can address.


625
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:27,046
The current one; in this example
1.5, identified in the feed


626
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:28,386
as version string 1.5.


627
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,996
And if you have a new one
that you're building up,


628
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:36,366
getting ready, then
that's available as well,


629
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:42,156
version 2.0 in this example,
with version string 2.0.


630
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:47,256
Diving into the version element,
you'll finally see the locales,


631
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,396
which are all the
localizations for your app.


632
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:53,396
In iTunes Connect, you do
that by using this pull-down


633
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:55,516
to identify the language:
English,


634
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:56,946
U.S. English to be precise here.


635
00:29:57,626 --> 00:30:00,866
In the feed, that's
locale element


636
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:04,306
with the language
identified by name en-US,


637
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:07,286
and that's a BCP
47 language tag.


638
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:13,016
BCP 47 is a very wide format
for referring to a language.


639
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:16,546
You can refer to any language
spoken on this planet this way.


640
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,486
But the store is only
available in 28 languages,


641
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,816
so to see the list of the ones
that are actually valid here,


642
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:25,246
please take a look
at the documentation.


643
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,336
Let's dive in further
down into the locale,


644
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:33,826
and what you see there is
finally these fields addressed


645
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:37,246
that you normally edit
in iTunes Connect.


646
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:38,056
"Name" is the title.


647
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:40,546
"Description" is
the description.


648
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:45,206
And "What's new in this version"
is "version what's new".


649
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:49,106
Keywords are comma
delimited in iTunes Connect;


650
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:51,066
in the feed they're
separate elements.


651
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:54,726
And URLs: three of
them in iTunes Connect;


652
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:57,756
three of them in the feed.


653
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:58,506e
Screenshots.


654
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,306
Well, screenshots are just
a bit more complicated


655
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:06,896
because you have to refer to
both the type of the device


656
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:08,786
that the screenshot is
for and its position


657
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:10,896
in iTunes Connect and,
ultimately, in the store.


658
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:17,066
Positions go 1 through 5 because
there's up to five per device.


659
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,396
For 4-inch iPhone, I have
display target iOS 4-inch


660
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:26,006
in Position 1; and,
for example for iPad,


661
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,856
here it is - iOS
iPad Position 1.


662
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:30,296
Postions go 1 through 5.


663
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:33,526
Well, there's one
more thing to note


664
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:37,456
in the software screenshot
section, with regards


665
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,616
to the requirements
for the elements.


666
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:43,146
I said earlier that you
could omit the sections


667
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:45,486
that you're not making
any changes to.


668
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:46,766
And that's true.


669
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:49,106
You can omit the entire
software screenshot section


670
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,446
if there are no changes in it.


671
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,916
However, if there are
changes in the section --


672
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:55,486
let's say you're
adding a screenshot,


673
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:57,916
you're moving them about,
or you're deleting one --


674
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:00,286
please supply the
entire section.


675
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:02,676
Here's why.


676
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,956
If you omit a screenshot


677
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,026
within the software screenshots
section, that's your signal


678
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,496
to us that we should remove it.


679
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:12,886
So please state the
entire section


680
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:14,276
if you make any changes
in there.


681
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,916
That doesn't mean that
you'll actually end


682
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:21,116
up uploading the screenshot
file over and over again,


683
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:23,726
and that's because for
each screenshot file,


684
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:27,966
you have to supply the
size in bytes, the filename


685
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:29,866
of course, and the checksum.


686
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,776
If the size and the
checksum match what we have


687
00:32:34,406 --> 00:32:37,676
for this device type,
in this position,


688
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,566
Transporter will skip the upload


689
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:43,936
because we already have the
file; we don't need it again.


690
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,786
So, version level
localization tags.


691
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,636
Let's take a look at the rights
and pricing for your app.


692
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,646
In iTunes Connect, that's under
Rights and Pricing button.


693
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:56,276
And in the feed, that's
in the Products Section.


694
00:32:57,426 --> 00:33:01,826
What you'll see there
corresponds to iTunes Connect,


695
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:06,606
in that most of the settings are
applicable worldwide, globally.


696
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:08,246
So let's go through those first.


697
00:33:08,956 --> 00:33:12,126
You identify the global
applicability of those settings


698
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:14,636
by using the Product element
for Territory Worldwide.


699
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:15,946
That's here.


700
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:20,396
Then what goes in there is
first the availability date


701
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:24,116
for your app, which is sales
start date; if you have discount


702
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:25,276
for education institutions,


703
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,006
that's under Allow
Volume Discount,


704
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,186
true or false, a Boolean value.


705
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:31,836
Also, on the global level,


706
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:37,576
you have the pricing
information for your app.


707
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,786
In iTunes Connect, that's
a pull-down for price tier;


708
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:42,436
in the feed, that's
wholesale price tier.


709
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,136
I have it as 3 in this example.


710
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,596
The tiers actually apply in
intervals that let you set


711
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,436
up sales windows ahead of time.


712
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,276
Here I have the interval
section,


713
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:57,156
and this interval starts
on the start date there;


714
00:33:57,156 --> 00:34:00,466
same concept as in
iTunes Connect.


715
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,646
And the tier end
date is End Date.


716
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,106
What this corresponds to in
iTunes Connect is the ability


717
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:09,786
to set up the schedule
for the changes


718
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,126
of the prices ahead of time.


719
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:15,246
So, for example, I have an
app that's normally at Tier 3,


720
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:18,626
but for the duration of this
conference, it goes on sale


721
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,746
down to Tier 1, and
then comes back to 3


722
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,076
after the end of the conference.


723
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:24,996
Now you could do the same
in a feed, of course.


724
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:26,406
This is how.


725
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:29,826
In the Intervals element,
first interval goes


726
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:33,436
until June 10, at Price Tier 3.


727
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,446
Then it goes on sale for the
duration of the conference


728
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:41,766
down to Tier 1 and then
comes back up to Tier 3.


729
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,315
Notice no end date, which means


730
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,976
that this is the tier that's
effective in perpetuity,


731
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,666
until you decide to change it.


732
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:53,216
These are all the globally
applicable elements.


733
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,866
What could you do on
a per-territory basis?


734
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,736
Well, what you get
to do there is


735
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:00,006
to state whether your app is
available for sale there or not,


736
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,756
and there are two
ways to go about it:


737
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,446
by exclusion or by inclusion.


738
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:08,216
The exclusion principle
goes like this.


739
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:10,436
You start by saying that
your app is available


740
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:14,886
for sale everywhere: territory
WW; cleared for sale, true.


741
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,086
And then you enumerate
through the product sections,


742
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:22,046
stating the territories where
it should not be available.


743
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,376
So here's an example of
the app not being available


744
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,146
for sale in Japan.


745
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:27,866
If you go with the
exclusion principle


746
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:32,176
and Apple opens app stores
in additional territories,


747
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:34,396
your app will automatically go
on sale there; nothing you need


748
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:35,896
to do for that, because, well,


749
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,186
it's not excluded
from sale there.


750
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:41,136
The inclusion principle
is the exact opposite.


751
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,706
You start by saying that
your app is not available


752
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,946
for sale anywhere: cleared
for sale is false for WW.


753
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:50,246
And then you enumerate
the Product blocks,


754
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:52,176
stating which territories
the apps should be available


755
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:52,886
for sale in.


756
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,106
Here's the example of
the app being available


757
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:56,086
for sale in Japan only.


758
00:35:56,656 --> 00:36:00,346
So, two ways of going about
that territory settings.


759
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,496
So, these were rights
and pricing for your app.


760
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,546
I'm going to briefly talk
over In-App purchases


761
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:07,666
and Game Center in the feed.


762
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,626
Briefly, because those
features have been available


763
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,406
since last year.


764
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:14,926
In-App purchases in
iTunes Connect are


765
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:18,096
under Manage In-App
Purchases button, of course,


766
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:19,036
and in the feed they are


767
00:36:19,036 --> 00:36:22,306
under In-App Purchases
section, which is fairly deep.


768
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,356
There's a lot of detail in
there, please take a look


769
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,216
at that documentation
for what's available.


770
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:30,346
What we are adding here
today is the ability


771
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:34,786
to submit hosted content
packages that you can create


772
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:37,476
with Xcode, but now you can
submit them through the feed;


773
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:37,956
you would have had


774
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:41,736
to use Application Loader
for that previously.


775
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:45,326
To remind what that is, if
your In-App purchase happens


776
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,876
to be a non-consumable,
such as say a map or a level


777
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,836
for the game, and if
you would like Apple


778
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:54,216
to actually host the content
for it, you produce that package


779
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:57,546
in Xcode, and then you
can indicate in the feed


780
00:36:57,546 --> 00:37:00,596
that you would like Apple
to host it and provide it


781
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:06,526
as an asset in the
package when you upload.


782
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:09,286
Game Center in the feed works
the same way it's been working


783
00:37:09,286 --> 00:37:10,276
since last year.


784
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,436
In iTunes Connect, that's
under Manage Game Center.


785
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:17,226
In feed, that's Game Center
section with the subsections


786
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:18,706
of Achievements and
Leaderboards,


787
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,576
and each of those
is fairly deep.


788
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,606
Please take a look at
documentation for details.


789
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,396
These were the In-App purchases
and Game Center, and this kind


790
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,486
of wraps up the metadata
portion.


791
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:33,436
As I mentioned earlier,


792
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:37,396
Transporter could also
obtain catalog reports


793
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:38,756
for you on a command line.


794
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:42,606
If you haven't used
catalog reports,


795
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:46,996
these are tab-delimited,
downloadable reports


796
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,236
that give you a sweeping
overview of the data


797
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:54,706
that you have in iTunes
Connect for your apps,


798
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,286
the in-app purchases, or
recently added reports


799
00:37:58,286 --> 00:37:59,586
for leaderboards
and achievements.


800
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:01,536
You select which ones you want,


801
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:06,446
you click the Request New
Reports, and you'll get an email


802
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:08,086
when the report is
available for download.


803
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:09,586
You could do that
up to once a day.


804
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,766
Well, the same capability
is now present


805
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,576
through on a command line.


806
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:18,606
There are two modes;
for requesting reports


807
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,136
and for checking
on their status.


808
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:24,806
You would use the Request
Reports method in Transporter:


809
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,856
supply the iTunes Connect
username, the type of reports --


810
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,646
in this case, I'm
asking for all of them,


811
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:32,436
or you could specify
one of the four --


812
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,326
and then the location of
a local destination folder


813
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:34,996
where you'd like it.


814
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,586
And two things might happen.


815
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:38,796
If the reports are
already ready for download,


816
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:41,516
you would just get them right
away in the reports folder.


817
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,156
If they haven't been
asked for yet today,


818
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:46,726
you'll get a message saying


819
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:48,956
that they will be
made available soon,


820
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,616
and you'll get an
email when they are.


821
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:52,296
But you don't have to
wait for that email,


822
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,636
because you could
check on the status


823
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:57,756
of previously issued requests
through the list reports method,


824
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:01,756
and you get a status
output for each report type


825
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,706
that you've requested.


826
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:09,346
So, these were catalog
reports through Transporter.


827
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,746
Well, now, now's your turn.


828
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:20,726
It's your turn because these
features are available now.


829
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,786
They're out there;
you can use them.


830
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,966
You have Transporter, which
manages the interaction


831
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,806
between your environment
and iTunes Connect.


832
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:31,326
You have app metadata XML feed
for version level localization,


833
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:35,376
rights and pricing for
your app, in-app purchases,


834
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:38,666
and Game Center, and you
can also get catalog reports


835
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,406
through Transporter.


836
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:45,366
What I'd like you to do today,
a little later, tomorrow,


837
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:49,226
is download documentation
that we have on iTunes Connect


838
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:50,476
on the Manage Your Apps screen.


839
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:52,276
You need two pieces
of information:


840
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:55,016
"Transporter User Guide," that
goes through all the commands


841
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:58,006
that we went through today --
and there's actually a lot more,


842
00:39:58,006 --> 00:39:59,406
and certainly a lot
more options for them.


843
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:02,556
And the "App Metadata
Specification," which goes


844
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,506
into minute detail
for all the tags


845
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:08,226
and all the requirements
for them.


846
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:11,876
Armed with this information,
what you'd be able


847
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,316
to do is automate a lot
of your interactions


848
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,116
with iTunes Connect.


849
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:20,976
You will be able to bulk manage
data, and you can integrate


850
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:24,536
that management with your
backend content management


851
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:27,516
systems, whatever
shape they are in.


852
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,546
Even, let's say if you are
an individual developer


853
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:32,336
and you have one or
two apps in the store,


854
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:34,766
this is still applicable to
you because you could come


855
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,646
up with this package, you
could put it all together


856
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:40,846
and upload it in one
shot and be done.


857
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:47,896
But to get back to the
integration idea, how it shapes


858
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:51,326
up is really up to
you, because, well,


859
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:53,246
we don't know what those
content management systems


860
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,606
in your company are.


861
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:59,486
You know that; we don't.


862
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:03,386
They suit your flows;
they suit your processes.


863
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:07,466
What we're providing is the
ability to integrate with them.


864
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:10,826
We're providing the tool,
Transporter, and the format,


865
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:15,526
metadata XML feed, and
the rest is up to you.


866
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:19,576
But we do have a demo of what


867
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:22,946
that interaction might look
like, and my colleague, Aravind,


868
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:23,796
will take you through it now.


869
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:24,156
Thank you!


870
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:24,916
>> Aravind: Thank you Nik.


871
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:29,526
Well, that was an incredible
amount of new information there.


872
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:33,246
And naturally, the questions
would be, what's next...


873
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:34,386
how do we get started...


874
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:37,236
more importantly, how do
we put this in practice.


875
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,416
Good morning, my
name is Aravind.


876
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:40,876
I'm an engineer in
the iTunes Store.


877
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:47,226
I'm here today to show you, how
you could keep your app metadata


878
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:49,796
in sync with iTunes Connect
using command line tools.


879
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:54,516
So, what we're going to do today
is, first invoke Transporter


880
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:57,856
with the lookupMetadata method,
which will get all the data


881
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:59,266
down to your local storage.


882
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:03,446
We'll visualize it, make
changes, and when we're ready


883
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:06,196
to upload, we'll use the
upload method in Transporter


884
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:07,476
to upload it back
to iTunes Connect.


885
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,656
We'll see the changes
on iTunes Connect.


886
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,096
So let's get started.


887
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:15,756
Let's in fact start with
what we already know


888
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:18,586
and are familiar
with: iTunes Connect.


889
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,666
So here we have the iOS app.


890
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:23,596
It's got two versions.


891
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:25,936
There's one version
that is Ready for Sale


892
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,606
and another version that
we're preparing for upload.


893
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:29,366
Let's play today
with the version


894
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,346
that we're preparing for upload.


895
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,446
So we see that it's
got some basic data,


896
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:39,436
there's no localization, just
basic app default language.


897
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:41,386
It has a couple of screenshots.


898
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:43,996
Let's go back up to
Rights and Pricing.


899
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:51,436
We see that our app is on sale
at price tier 3 and it's only


900
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,806
on sale in the United States.


901
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:55,026
So, this is the data
that we have.


902
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:56,106
This is what we're
starting out with.


903
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:57,566
And this is what we want


904
00:42:57,566 --> 00:42:59,486
to download before we can
start playing with it.


905
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:05,316
So, we'll invoke a script,
and because this is all meant


906
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,646
to show case command line
ways of automating your stuff,


907
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,226
everything is scripted.


908
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:14,676
So, the first script I'm going
to run is, lookupMetadata.


909
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:17,326
You can see that it's a simple
shell script and it's going


910
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,706
to invoke a bunch of
other scripts and so on.


911
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:21,076
And the first thing it's going
to do is download the metadata.


912
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:24,286
We hit return and we see
that it is attempting


913
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:25,096
to invoke Transporter.


914
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,466
Let's quickly go
over the options


915
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,616
that we're passing
to Transporter.


916
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:32,606
The first parameter is the
"-m lookupMetadata" parameter


917
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:34,386
and it's basically
telling Transporter


918
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,126
to download the metadata.


919
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:38,826
Metadata for what?


920
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,766
If you look at the
parameter called "vendor-id",


921
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:43,366
that's your app SKU and that
basically tells Transporter


922
00:43:43,816 --> 00:43:47,756
to lookup the metadata
for that particular app.


923
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,596
We pass in the username
and password.


924
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:52,336
Note that this is not the
actual username and password.


925
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:55,376
This is another automation
feature that tells Transporter


926
00:43:55,376 --> 00:43:57,446
to lookup your actual
username and password


927
00:43:57,446 --> 00:43:59,126
from environment
variables USERNAME


928
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,126
and PASSWORD, uppercase.


929
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,986
And finally, the "destination"
parameter tells Transporter


930
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:07,346
where to actually store the
data on your local storage.


931
00:44:08,556 --> 00:44:09,896
You'll also notice
the "-v" parameter


932
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,156
that just tells Transporter
to log only critical messages.


933
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:15,696
So, I hit return, and,
Transporter does a bunch


934
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:18,286
of self-checks, and begins
downloading the data.


935
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:19,766
And it's done.


936
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:24,856
So, what Transporter did was
create a package directory


937
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:27,546
called itmsp with the
name of your app SKU


938
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:29,976
and our script now
takes over and wants


939
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:31,286
to open the XML document.


940
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:38,226
Let's hit return, and,
we open it in Xcode.


941
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:42,856
Now, this is a giant XML
document, and I don't want to go


942
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:43,956
through it in great detail.


943
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:47,376
It's not that useful
for human visualization.


944
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,636
But let me just point
out a couple of things.


945
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,746
The thing I wanted to show
you was the identifiers.


946
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,456
The team-id and the vendor-id.


947
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:59,206
Now, I point this out
because, when you do a lookup,


948
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,216
you get the metadata and these
identifiers are provided to you.


949
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,346
When you're ready to
send the data back,


950
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:06,586
you have to provide these
two identifiers as well.


951
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:09,276
And then there's a whole
bunch of other data.


952
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:11,636
Now, as I said, this is XML


953
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:14,136
and it's not exactly
usable or human friendly.


954
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:17,656
So what we want to do is
transform this to a format


955
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,646
that we can actually
work with and use.


956
00:45:19,646 --> 00:45:22,256
Now, this is where it
gets a little interesting.


957
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:26,396
For the purpose of this demo,
I've made a deliberate choice


958
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:28,926
to model this XML
as a series of flat,


959
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:30,656
simple command separated values.


960
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:34,246
When you are ready to
integrate iTunes Connect


961
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,816
with your Content
Management System,


962
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,146
you get to make your
choices of how you mode


963
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:40,456
and how you transform it.


964
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:44,116
So let's close our Xcode.


965
00:45:44,246 --> 00:45:45,246
Go back to our script.


966
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:48,626
Our script is ready to transform
this XML to a CSV document.


967
00:45:49,156 --> 00:45:52,596
I hit return, transformation
complete, and it wants


968
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,296
to open this CSV document.


969
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:58,386
Speaking of CSV documents,
the most obvious choice


970
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,286
for opening a CSV
document is ...


971
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:06,686
Numbers. So, we hit return and
open the document in Numbers.


972
00:46:06,786 --> 00:46:08,376
And... Boom!


973
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:12,786
Just the data, without all
that distracting XML tags.


974
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,096
Ok, so what are we
looking at here?


975
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,556
You can kind of make out
that there are four sections


976
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:23,026
or blocks of data,
labeled as Entities.


977
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,876
So, the first entity
type is locale.


978
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:27,916
It's got all the
basic app metadata,


979
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:30,866
across various versions,
across various localizations.


980
00:46:33,036 --> 00:46:34,676
Currently, of course, as
we saw on iTunes Connect,


981
00:46:34,676 --> 00:46:37,256
it only has English, US-English,
and that's what we see here.


982
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:39,926
The second section
deals with screenshots.


983
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:42,266
It's got all the screenshots
across all versions,


984
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,866
across all localizations,
across all device types.


985
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:48,456
And again, we saw on iTunes
Connect, we have just a couple


986
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:50,416
of screenshots for version 2.0.


987
00:46:51,596 --> 00:46:52,786
The third and fourth sections,


988
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:54,516
deal with Pricing
and Availability.


989
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:59,256
As we saw on iTunes Connect, our
app is on sale at price tier 3,


990
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:02,096
and it's available only
in the United States.


991
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:06,986
So, this is the data we saw on
iTunes Connect, we were able


992
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:08,216
to successfully download
it here,


993
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:10,226
and we're able to visualize it.


994
00:47:11,556 --> 00:47:12,576
We like the data...


995
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:15,166
let's change it.


996
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:18,206
Let's say we want to add a
couple of new localizations.


997
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,426
Let's say we want
to add app metadata


998
00:47:20,426 --> 00:47:22,006
for Spanish and Russian.


999
00:47:23,226 --> 00:47:25,156
We want to make the app
available for sale in Russia


1000
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,846
and in Spain in addition
to the United States.


1001
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,756
And while we're at it, we
want to make our app er,


1002
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:37,986
put out app on sale at price
tier 1 for let's say a month.


1003
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,326
Now, that's a lot of changes.


1004
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:42,656
Now, I could make
all those edits here,


1005
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:45,986
but we don't have the time.


1006
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:47,346
Plus, I don't know
Spanish or Russian.


1007
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,556
So, let me close this out.


1008
00:47:49,846 --> 00:47:54,176
I have somebody do all the hard
work of translating all this,


1009
00:47:54,176 --> 00:47:59,066
so I have another document,
that has all these edits.


1010
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:02,476
Alright, so what are
we looking at here?


1011
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,816
It's practically, the same
document we saw earlier.


1012
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:07,946
The changes are highlighted


1013
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:09,766
in bright eye-popping
yellow, so you don't miss it.


1014
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:12,346
The ones I haven't
changed are greyed out.


1015
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:16,346
So you can see that we have
some content for Spanish,


1016
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:19,816
content for Russian,
all that nice,


1017
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,596
happy looking Cyrillic
characters there...


1018
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:26,706
we have a bunch of screenshots
for every device type,


1019
00:48:27,506 --> 00:48:28,856
so we have a whole bunch
of screenshots here.


1020
00:48:30,696 --> 00:48:32,806
We see that we're
making the app available


1021
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,176
for sale in Spain and Russia.


1022
00:48:35,676 --> 00:48:38,956
And we also see the price
tier go down for a month to 1.


1023
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:42,326
So, that's a lot of changes.


1024
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:44,236
Let's upload it.


1025
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:47,436
I go back but this time
use a different script.


1026
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,706
This script is going to do
sort of like the mirror image


1027
00:48:51,776 --> 00:48:52,786
of what the previous script did.


1028
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:56,736
It's going to take this flat,
comma separated values document,


1029
00:48:57,306 --> 00:49:00,536
transform it to XML and then
upload it to iTunes Connect.


1030
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:05,826
I invoke a script called
upload-metadata.sh.


1031
00:49:06,836 --> 00:49:09,836
So the first thing it's doing
is converting the CSV to XML.


1032
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:11,176
Done. Hit enter.


1033
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:13,306
Now, it wants to
invoke Transporter.


1034
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,676
Now, these options, should
be familiar to you by now,


1035
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:17,496
except the first option "-m".


1036
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,916
This time, we're using
the "upload" method


1037
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:23,376
that tells Transporter to take
your package and send it over.


1038
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:25,566
Where is the package?


1039
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:27,306
That's the "-f" parameter,
that says,


1040
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,126
look for the itmsp package here,


1041
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:31,896
and that's the content
that's going


1042
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:32,896
to be sent to iTunes Connect.


1043
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:37,936
I hit return, and the
upload process begins.


1044
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:40,436
Transporter does its self
checks, sends the data over,


1045
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:45,566
and it looks like we failed.


1046
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,296
OK. Nik mentioned earlier
that we do all the validations


1047
00:49:48,436 --> 00:49:49,936
that you're familiar with
in iTunes Connect, here,


1048
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:51,116
and this is an example.


1049
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:54,176
Every single field validation
that you have and you love


1050
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:55,716
on iTunes Connect is
done here as well.


1051
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,026
And some more.


1052
00:49:57,076 --> 00:49:58,586
Because of the nature
of the interaction,


1053
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:00,476
we do some additional
validations.


1054
00:50:01,286 --> 00:50:05,056
In this case, it turns
out, version 2.0,


1055
00:50:05,056 --> 00:50:08,376
in the Russian localization,
there is something wrong


1056
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:09,936
in the ordering of
the screenshots


1057
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,716
for iOS 4 inch device.


1058
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:13,426
The error message
is pretty clear,


1059
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:16,036
so let's go to our original data
and see what's going on here.


1060
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:21,586
I'm looking at the screenshots
section, version 2.0, iOS 4 inch


1061
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,426
and here is my list
of positions.


1062
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:28,016
And sure enough, we see that
it's not ordered correctly.


1063
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:33,006
There's a typo, so
let me fix it.


1064
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:34,976
There! That should fix it.


1065
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:36,846
Save it. And let's
try this again.


1066
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:42,306
Invoke upload-metadata.sh,
transform to XML,


1067
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,956
invoke Transporter, hit return,


1068
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:46,746
and let's see what we
end up with this time.


1069
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,226
The same process happens.


1070
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:51,556
The server does a
bunch of validations,


1071
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:55,936
and if everything is good,
it should accept the upload.


1072
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:58,316
And it turns out,
everything was good.


1073
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,406
But we're not done yet.


1074
00:51:01,866 --> 00:51:04,356
The upload is done, but,


1075
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,416
what we've uploaded
needs to be processed.


1076
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,806
The server takes a little
bit of time to do that.


1077
00:51:09,506 --> 00:51:12,286
So let's make use
of that time to look


1078
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,816
at what exactly we sent over.


1079
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:20,766
We notice that, that's the
directory we gave Transporter


1080
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:21,276
to upload.


1081
00:51:21,836 --> 00:51:25,696
So let me "cd" to that directory
and see what's going on there.


1082
00:51:27,176 --> 00:51:29,136
We can see that there'a
metadata.xml.


1083
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:32,686
That XML is essentially the
transformation of the flat,


1084
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:35,026
giant spreadsheet from
before into an XML format.


1085
00:51:35,616 --> 00:51:36,676
And a bunch of screenshots.


1086
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:40,936
Now, if you're wondering,
we had three localizations,


1087
00:51:40,936 --> 00:51:43,006
fifteen screenshots each,
so forty five screeshots,


1088
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,236
but we only see fifteen
screenshots here,


1089
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:46,076
this is a demo, so I'm
reusing the screenshots


1090
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,226
across all localizations.


1091
00:51:48,436 --> 00:51:51,236
And, while we'e at it,
let's look the metadata.xml.


1092
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:54,466
This is the outgoing
metadata.xml.


1093
00:51:54,466 --> 00:51:59,546
Notice that, the format is
almost exactly the same.


1094
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:04,086
We notice that we're sending the
team-id back, vendor-id back,


1095
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:06,286
and pretty much all
the localizations.


1096
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:10,736
Before we move on, let me
point out just one quick thing.


1097
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:14,876
We made one Transporter
call, got everything down,


1098
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:16,856
all that's relevant
for localizations,


1099
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:19,666
and we made changes
to the format,


1100
00:52:19,756 --> 00:52:22,376
and another Transporter call and
uploaded the whole thing back.


1101
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:25,856
Now that's automation at its
simplest and most efficient.


1102
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:28,836
OK, so that was a
lot of changes...


1103
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:30,216
but did it work?


1104
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:34,206
Let's go back to iTunes
Connect, and check.


1105
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:39,006
I'll do a refresh, I guess
it's still working on it.


1106
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:40,256
(Refresh again).


1107
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:43,946
There! We see the price tier
go down to tier 1 for a month,


1108
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:45,726
and then back to tier 3.


1109
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:51,446
Our app is on sale in Spain,
in Russia, and of course,


1110
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:53,296
we didn't change anything for
the United States, so it's still


1111
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:54,476
on sale in the United States.


1112
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,946
Let's go back to localizations.


1113
00:52:57,896 --> 00:52:58,846
I'll cancel this.


1114
00:53:00,196 --> 00:53:04,086
Version 2.0, right!


1115
00:53:04,086 --> 00:53:06,096
In English, the only thing we
did was we added a whole bunch


1116
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:07,546
of screenshots and those
screenshots are here.


1117
00:53:07,546 --> 00:53:09,776
Ok, how about the
other localizations?


1118
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:10,556
Russian...


1119
00:53:11,286 --> 00:53:11,806
very good.


1120
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:12,526
They're all here.


1121
00:53:13,386 --> 00:53:14,176
And Spanish....


1122
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:18,736
and... they're all here.


1123
00:53:18,926 --> 00:53:21,346
So, that pretty much brings
us to the end of the demo.


1124
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:25,166
What we did was, we downloaded
the metadata, we were able


1125
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:27,686
to transform it to a form we
could visualize and play with,


1126
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:30,216
store etc. and we
uploaded the metadata.


1127
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:33,246
I hope this gave you some ideas


1128
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:35,966
about how you can integrate
your Content Management Systems


1129
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:36,816
with iTunes Connect.


1130
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:38,946
Happy Integration,
and Thank you.


1131
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:40,206
>> Dave Van Tassell:
OK, thank you Aravind.


1132
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,226
That's a lot of information.


1133
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:44,656
There will be a test when
you leave the room there.


1134
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:46,496
People in red shirts
have it for you.


1135
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:49,876
So there's our enhanced
command-line automation.


1136
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:52,966
Every year, we like
to ask App Review


1137
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:54,746
if they have any
suggestions for you.


1138
00:53:55,506 --> 00:53:57,446
A few dos and don'ts,
so let's go over those.


1139
00:53:57,446 --> 00:54:01,506
On the metadata side, if you're
providing a demo account,


1140
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,236
make sure it's full
access to the app.


1141
00:54:03,706 --> 00:54:06,316
Please list any hardware that's
required to review your app.


1142
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:09,096
The screenshots and the
description: They have to be


1143
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:13,606
about your app and need to
have the rights for any content


1144
00:54:13,606 --> 00:54:15,386
and keywords that
you put in your app.


1145
00:54:16,746 --> 00:54:21,416
For the app behavior itself,
high quality experience;


1146
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,436
I think that speaks for itself.


1147
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:23,476
Please test the app.


1148
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:24,896
I know I shouldn't
have to say that.


1149
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:27,706
After five years, we
are still reviewing apps


1150
00:54:27,706 --> 00:54:29,556
that crash and have bugs.


1151
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:33,166
Appropriate usage of
both background mode


1152
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,066
and iCloud storage
is very important,


1153
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,676
as is if you are selling any
digital content or services,


1154
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:40,156
in-app purchases
are the way to go.


1155
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:43,406
For privacy, we value
our users' privacy.


1156
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:45,486
Please don't ask
for any information,


1157
00:54:45,486 --> 00:54:47,526
unless it is relevant for
the app functionality.


1158
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:49,946
And lastly, iPhone 5 support.


1159
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:53,646
This is the number one reason
that apps upon upload move


1160
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:56,686
into the invalid binary
section, invalid binary state.


1161
00:54:56,686 --> 00:54:59,626
It is a mistake with the
iPhone 5 launch image.


1162
00:55:00,056 --> 00:55:02,246
There's a lot of
documentation information online


1163
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:03,366
about how to do that correctly.


1164
00:55:03,586 --> 00:55:04,086
