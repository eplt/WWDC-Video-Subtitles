3
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:37,556
>> Good afternoon, everyone.


4
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:39,946
My name is Zoltan.


5
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,996
Later my colleague, Eric,
will join me on stage.


6
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:47,986
We're both engineers
with the Xcode team.


7
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,066
Software development
these days is a lot


8
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,316
like conducting an orchestra.


9
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,726
You and I maintain suites
of tests, and when one


10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,446
of them is not performing well,


11
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:05,166
we need to quickly understand
the issue and correct it.


12
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:10,626
Okay. Maybe you're a
testing maestro with hundreds


13
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,456
of thousands of tests.


14
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,906
Well, Xcode has tools
and techniques


15
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,586
to conduct even the
largest test suite,


16
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:24,016
and today we're going
to show you how.


17
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,786
First, we're going to
introduce some concepts


18
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,786
that haven't been addressed in
previous sessions, and then,


19
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,566
we'll introduce some
new features in Xcode,


20
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:41,586
in Xcode Server, in particular,


21
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,506
the configurable
integration user.


22
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:48,246
And then, we'll conclude with
some new features in xcodebuild.


23
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:49,956
Let's get started.


24
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,286
So, as a brief recap of testing,
you can think of testing


25
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:02,746
as these four characters.


26
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,546
There's XC test.


27
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,946
That's the framework
for your tests


28
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,856
for both Objective-C
and for Swift.


29
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:18,936
And your tests are compiled
to bundles before they're run.


30
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:25,426
Xcode, that's the IDE
for authoring your tests,


31
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:30,016
and you can also run individual
test while you're developing.


32
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:36,016
Xcode is also where
you review reports


33
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:39,276
from both local test runs
and from Xcode Server.


34
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,816
And talking about Xcode Server,


35
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:46,366
that's the continuous
integration solution


36
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,256
for your tests.


37
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,336
You set up bots to
periodically run your tests,


38
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:55,136
and Xcode Server will
generate reports for you.


39
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:59,046
And if something goes
wrong, it'll notify you.


40
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,776
There's a great way to keep
track of your project over time.


41
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:09,186
So, Xcode Server is built
on top of xcodebuild,


42
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,846
and you can use xcodebuild
on the command line, too.


43
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,896
You can run tests and see
results in the console.


44
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:25,366
Xcodebuild is the
building block for custom,


45
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,666
continuous integration
systems, as we'll see later.


46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,166
So, you can learn more
about these four characters


47
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,406
in our previous sessions.


48
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,416
But, today, we want to
look at some concepts


49
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,796
that we haven't covered before.


50
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,476
We want to take you
behind the scenes


51
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,466
and show you exactly how
your tests are running.


52
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,426
And to do that, it helps
to think of a timeline.


53
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:55,186
After your tests are
compiled, they must be hosted.


54
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:59,196
That gets the test
started in the first place.


55
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,006
And then, once the
tests are running,


56
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,606
you can see detailed progress


57
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,506
in your tests using a
technique known as observation.


58
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,786
So, we're going to look
at these two concepts,


59
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:12,056
hosting and observation.


60
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,656
Let's look at hosting first.


61
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:18,636
So, the hosting story,
it's different depending


62
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,946
on whether you have
unit tests or UI tests.


63
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:28,066
So, for unit tests, your test
bundle is loaded directly


64
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,196
into your application.


65
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:33,126
And, in this case, we
call your application the


66
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,176
host application.


67
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:40,396
But for your UI tests, your test
bundle is going to get loaded


68
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,946
into a UI test runner which is
separate from your application.


69
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,656
And in this case, we
refer to your application


70
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,086
as the target application.


71
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,116
Now, this has some implications.


72
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,606
For your unit tests, you
will have direct access


73
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:03,826
to your applications
data structures and API,


74
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:07,846
but for your UI tests, you have


75
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:12,196
to access your application using
accessibility and send events


76
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,906
and see your application as a
user would from the outside.


77
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,156
For your unit tests, all
your tests are going to run


78
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:26,246
in the same launch of
the host application.


79
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,656
So, you should be
careful to clean


80
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,956
up between test invocations.


81
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:36,746
But for your UI tests,
your tests can terminate


82
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,296
and relaunch the application.


83
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:39,816
So, that's great if you want


84
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:43,326
to test how your
application starts up.


85
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,006
Okay. That's hosting.


86
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,846
That's how your test gets
started in the first place,


87
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,136
and once your tests are running,


88
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,046
then you can use a
technique known as observation


89
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,716
to see detailed progress
in your tests.


90
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:01,796
So, let's zoom in
on that timeline.


91
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,846
Here you can see two test cases,
one running after the other.


92
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:11,196
And these test cases
belong to a test suite.


93
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:15,756
Test suite corresponds to a
test class you've written.


94
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:20,116
And you'll have multiple test
suites in your test bundle.


95
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,616
And maybe you're interested


96
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,686
in doing some setup work
before any of these tests run.


97
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,256
Or perhaps doing
some tear down work


98
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,106
after all the tests
have finished.


99
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,436
Or maybe you're interested


100
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,916
in doing some custom
logging while the tests run.


101
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,256
Well, you can do that with the
XCTestObservation Protocol.


102
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,696
You write an object that
conforms to this protocol,


103
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:49,216
and after registering it with
a shared observation center,


104
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,346
your object will
receive call backs.


105
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,566
So, for instance, before
any of the tests start,


106
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:00,266
you'll get this BundleWillStart
call back.


107
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:03,286
And then, before
the suite starts,


108
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:07,386
you'll get a SuiteWillStart
call back.


109
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,986
Then, for every test
case that runs,


110
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:16,176
you'll get this
testCaseWillStart call back


111
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,866
and testCaseDidFinish call back.


112
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:22,896
If something goes awry,


113
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:26,966
you'll get this testCaseDidFail
call back.


114
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,346
And then, as the
tests are wrapping up,


115
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:33,276
you'll get this
testSuiteDidFinish call back,


116
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:36,366
and your final chance
to do any work is


117
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:40,466
in this testBundleWillFinish
call back.


118
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,036
So, here's an example.


119
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,006
This object conforms to
XCTestObservation Protocol.


120
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:52,376
In the object initializer,
I'm going to register


121
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:54,046
with a shared observation
center.


122
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,546
Then, as the tests progress,


123
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm going to log
events, such as this one.


124
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:08,176
When things go wrong with the
test, I'm going to log this.


125
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:13,456
And then, once the show is
over, I'll log that, too.


126
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:17,026
So, an ideal place to
set up this observer is


127
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,596
in your test bundles info.plist.


128
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,906
So, you do that using
Xcode's info.plist editor.


129
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,486
You add this NS principal
class entry,


130
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:34,596
and this is a test specific
instantiation for your observer.


131
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,635
It's independent of the
class load initializer.


132
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:45,256
Okay. That's hosting
and observation.


133
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,696
They're useful concepts to help
understand exactly how your


134
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,316
tests are running
behind the scenes


135
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:55,436
and to help you diagnose
issues with your tests.


136
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,286
Let's look at some new
features in Xcode 8.


137
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,126
Crashes are a frequent
source of failures in tests,


138
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,826
and the crashes can be in
both your host application


139
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,726
and the target application.


140
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,566
So, normally, Xcode will
relaunch your host application


141
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:16,896
to complete your test suite.


142
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:21,996
But it's up to you to gather
the diagnostics necessary


143
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:25,456
to resolve the crash.


144
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,566
I'm please to say that
this year, Xcode is going


145
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,986
to help with this issue.


146
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,766
We will now gather the crash
logs for you in the test report.


147
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:41,456
So, this is both for UI
and unit tests, for local


148
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,486
and server runs of your tests.


149
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:47,896
The crash logs will be
collected in the test report.


150
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,866
And you can see the
textual representation


151
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:55,666
of the crash there, or you
can choose to see the crash


152
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,306
in the context of your source.


153
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,766
And I'd like to show
you that now.


154
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,606
Eric and I have been
moonlighting.


155
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:07,736
We've been working on a tvOS
application in our spare time.


156
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:09,446
So, I'll run the application


157
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,976
by control clicking
on the Run button.


158
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:21,226
It's an application
defined nearby concerts


159
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:24,116
with some strangely
test related band names.


160
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,596
I can move in the
simulator using the keys


161
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:30,376
on the keyboard here.


162
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,086
So, we're adding a new
feature to this application


163
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:37,506
to support users who have
location services disabled.


164
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:40,876
Let me show you what it's
like for those users.


165
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:51,556
I'll go to the settings
menu, and in privacy,


166
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:53,976
I'll disable location services.


167
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:05,436
So, now, back in Xcode, we've
added a new ViewController


168
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,846
to support those users.


169
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,966
They can enter in a zip code.


170
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,676
Let me just add one more
test for this ViewController.


171
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:24,316
So, I want these tests to
run in a scheme on their own.


172
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,256
So, I'm going to go
to the scheme menu,


173
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,926
and I'll duplicate
this existing scheme.


174
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:37,576
I'll call this something
meaningful.


175
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,686
And, in the settings
for the test action,


176
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,236
I'm going to disable
the debugger.


177
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,126
So, that's a technique to
avoid interrupting the tests.


178
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:55,126
It allows all the tests
to run to completion


179
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,476
without breaking
into the debugger.


180
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,736
And it's similar to how your
tests run on Xcode Server.


181
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:05,206
So, I'll disable tests
that are not related


182
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,446
to location services.


183
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,266
I'll share the scheme.


184
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,976
And then, I'll run the
test with Command U.


185
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,446
So, here's a new
ViewController for users


186
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,266
who have location
services disabled.


187
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:42,166
They can choose to
enter a zip code.


188
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:44,816
So, right now, the tests
are entering a zip code,


189
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:55,136
and that's an unexpected crash.


190
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:59,256
So, right now, Xcode has
gathered the crash log,


191
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,516
and it's reported
the test failure.


192
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:05,026
And, let's have a look at that.


193
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,166
So, here's the failed
test, and I can click


194
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,596
to jump to the test report.


195
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,706
I'll disclose the
test transcript.


196
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,296
Here's the events as the tests
were entering in the zip code,


197
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:22,096
and here at the bottom
is the crash.


198
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,866
Now, I can click to see
the textual representation


199
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:30,026
of this crash, but in this case,
I want to show you the crash


200
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,716
in the context of the source.


201
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,726
So, I'll click on
this arrow here.


202
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:39,596
So, here's the exact line
that the crash occurred on.


203
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,166
And you can see in the
top left, the stack frames


204
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,436
in the debug navigator.


205
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:51,286
Now, I can see the crash
in the context of my source


206
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,396
and diagnose the issue.


207
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:55,336
So, I happen to know
that I'm referring


208
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,886
to the wrong ViewController
here.


209
00:13:57,356 --> 00:14:00,496
Instead of parent, this should
be presenting ViewController.


210
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:05,916
So, I'll make that change,
and now, I'll rerun the test


211
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,976
by going to the test navigator
and clicking on this icon here.


212
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,626
So, earlier, I showed
you the test report


213
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:22,916
for a local test run, but that
report would look exactly the


214
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,496
same if it came from
Xcode Server.


215
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,976
So, now the tests are
reentering a zip code.


216
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,296
Great. So, these
tests have passed.


217
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:47,986
We would now check in this
tests and build confidence


218
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,166
that we're supporting users who
have location services disabled.


219
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:54,296
But, for now, let's
go back to slides.


220
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:01,676
So, you've seen how Xcode will
now gather crash logs for you


221
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,966
and capture them
in the test report.


222
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,576
And you can choose to see
the textual representation


223
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:12,856
of those crashes, or
you can see the crashes


224
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,556
in the context of your source.


225
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,606
So, that's a great way
to diagnose the issue


226
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:23,966
and to make the fix right in
the context of your source.


227
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,466
So, we have some new
features in Xcode Server,


228
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:30,396
and to show you more,
please welcome my colleague,


229
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:31,956
Eric Dudiak, on stage.


230
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:37,036
[ Applause ]


231
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,206
>> Good afternoon.


232
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,556
I'm Eric Dudiak, and I'm
going to talk to you a bit


233
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:44,626
about Xcode Server and what
we have new in Xcode 8.


234
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,826
So, let's go over a
little bit of an overview


235
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,126
of what we're going
to talk about today


236
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,136
in Xcode 8 with Xcode Server.


237
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,646
So, we have custom
environment variables


238
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,306
that you can now
set per integration.


239
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,716
We have advanced
trigger editing workflow


240
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,726
that we've improved in Xcode 8.


241
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,066
We also have some enhancements
to issue tracking and blame


242
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,796
to make sure you get
notified of issues


243
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,746
as they come up on your bot.


244
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:13,416
And we'll see how that plays
with upgrade integrations,


245
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,646
a new feature we have for you.


246
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,806
And finally, we'll talk


247
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:18,636
about the configurable
integration user


248
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,066
which is new in Xcode
8, as well.


249
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,856
So, let's jump right
in, and let's talk


250
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,196
about custom environment
variables.


251
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:25,826
Now, this is a little
bit of a cheat.


252
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:29,076
It's actually new in Xcode
7.3, and it allows you


253
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,456
to configure the exact
environment that's passed


254
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,746
to xcodebuild on your bot.


255
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,966
And it controls how your
integrations are run there,


256
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:37,446
so you can configure any number
of settings that you might need


257
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,746
for your bot to run on
your server different


258
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:40,656
than you might have locally.


259
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,136
This is a great way to customize
how your server runs your


260
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,426
integrations, and it's a great
way to do that without having


261
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,056
to create a lot of extra
schemes in your project.


262
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,286
Now, on to what's
actually new in Xcode 8.


263
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:56,186
So, we've significantly improved
the trigger editing experience.


264
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,366
So, we have two types of
triggers, scripts and emails.


265
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,726
First, let's talk a little
bit about trigger scripts.


266
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,506
These run either
before your integration


267
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,366
or after your integration, and
they're normal shell scripts.


268
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:09,326
So, we've improved the editor
by giving you a lot more space


269
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,486
to see the scripts, and you
can actually see exactly what's


270
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,126
in them, so you have a lot
more visibility into that.


271
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,866
Along those lines, we also
now let you name triggers.


272
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,056
This is great if
you work on a team.


273
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,806
Your other teammates can see
exactly what each trigger is


274
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,556
supposed to be doing, and if you
have particularly long running


275
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,586
scripts that are part of
your integration triggers,


276
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,246
you will see that
called out in the status


277
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:32,176
as Xcode's integrating.


278
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,236
So, when you see a project
integrating into status UI,


279
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,266
you can actually see which
script it's currently running.


280
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,976
Finally, if you have a script
that you come up with later


281
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,276
that you actually really wish
was running before all your


282
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:46,136
other scripts, you can now
reorder triggers in this UI.


283
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:49,606
Simply add a new script
trigger, drag it to the top,


284
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:53,446
and it will become the
first to run on your bot.


285
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,416
Now, let's talk a little bit


286
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,356
about the other type
of trigger we have.


287
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:57,696
We have email notifications.


288
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,326
Historically, in Xcode Server,


289
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,856
this was always a one
email per integration setup


290
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,696
which can leave you
with a lot of spam.


291
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,156
So, in order to help you and
reduce the amount of email


292
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,946
in your inbox, we've split
these types of triggers


293
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:12,496
up into two different types.


294
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,566
We still have the report
triggers or report emails


295
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,466
that come out every time
you run an integration.


296
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,026
Of alternatively, you
can now schedule them


297
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:23,646
to run just once every
day or once every week.


298
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,756
This way, no matter how
often your bot runs,


299
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,706
your email isn't flooded,


300
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,836
or your inbox isn't flooded
with a lot of emails.


301
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,726
And we think this is great
for managers who want to check


302
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,736
up on the health of
a bot continuously


303
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:37,096
but don't want all their inbox
to be filled with emails.


304
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,426
Additionally, we also, now,


305
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,206
let you configure certain
fields on the email.


306
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,546
So, you can configure
your cc field as well


307
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:45,756
as your reply to fields.


308
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,866
This lets you have a lot more
control over exactly the types


309
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,466
of emails you're sending out.


310
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,506
Now, I hinted a little bit
earlier that we actually, now,


311
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,086
have two different
types of email triggers.


312
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,536
The other is issues.


313
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,036
So, new issues come up.


314
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,416
We will now send you an email
to the people of interest


315
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,576
for that particular issue.


316
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:05,236
We'll go over a little
bit of that in a minute.


317
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,246
But, if you do have more
committers that are part


318
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,226
of the code that
you're integrating


319
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,616
than you necessarily
want to email,


320
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,016
we do let you filter
recipients right here


321
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,936
to make sure you're emailing
just the people you want to be.


322
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:18,896
So, if we take a look at that.


323
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,516
If you have multiple
repositories, you can choose


324
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,326
to only send emails
to committers


325
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,406
from certain repositories,
or if you know exactly


326
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,636
which domains all the
email addresses will be


327
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,106
from that you want
to send emails to,


328
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:35,196
you can add those right here.


329
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,286
So, let's take a minute and
talk a little bit about issues


330
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,256
or build issues anyways.


331
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:44,656
And, nobody is perfect and
writes perfect code every time.


332
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,436
That's the whole reason we
have continuous integration.


333
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,846
That's why we have unit tests.


334
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,146
We have unit tests
because we know


335
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,386
that they will inevitably fail.


336
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,196
That's why we write
them in the first place.


337
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,946
We also, occasionally, commit
code that just doesn't build,


338
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,256
and some of us don't
check it before we commit,


339
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,586
and that's exactly
the kind of thing


340
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,776
that continuous integration
is great at catching.


341
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:07,496
And, in these types of cases,
Xcode will send you an email


342
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,096
and notify you that
you broke your build.


343
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:12,076
But those aren't the only
issues that can come up.


344
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,216
Sometimes, even if you write
absolutely perfect code,


345
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,546
things can change around you.


346
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,256
That can be when you install a
new Xcode, you get a whole bunch


347
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:21,086
of other new features, too.


348
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,716
You get new SDKs that might
have new deprecations.


349
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,566
You might get new issues
from language improvements.


350
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,376
And, we like to make
sure that every Xcode


351
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,606
that we ship is smarter than
the Xcode we shipped before.


352
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,716
So, you might see issues
that we didn't find before


353
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,486
that have always been
there that Xcode now tracks


354
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,816
such as static analysis issues.


355
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:41,956
So, the important
thing when you see one


356
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:42,946
of these emails is
we really want


357
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:44,886
to make sure it's
actionable, and let you know


358
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:47,316
that you're receiving this
email, for the issue emails,


359
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,076
when it is because
something happened


360
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,216
that you can do something about.


361
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,636
So, the first type is if
you introduced an issue.


362
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,156
And that's because you broke it.


363
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,586
So, this will call you out,
as you see right in the email.


364
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,506
You'll see an email like this


365
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:00,776
that says you introduced
an issue.


366
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,706
And we know this because
the issue showed up on


367
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,066
or near a line that you
just recently modified.


368
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,776
We also might know if,
between the two integrations


369
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,886
where the issue showed up, you
were the only person committing.


370
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,466
In that case, that's
pretty much a fair guess


371
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,126
that it's you that broke it.


372
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,616
Now, that's not always the case.


373
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:22,016
Take, for example, a
application that's built


374
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:22,996
on top of a framework.


375
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:26,416
A change in the framework
might cause breakage


376
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,836
in the application
without anyone committing


377
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:29,656
to the application.


378
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,846
So, in this case, you'll see
an email a little bit more


379
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:36,056
like this, and it'll be a little
bit less condemning of your work


380
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,356
and will simply say
that you might be able


381
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,426
to help fix an issue on the bot.


382
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:43,306
And we know this because you
commit frequently to the area


383
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,116
where the issue showed up.


384
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,556
So, we, essentially, assign
ownership to various areas.


385
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,496
And, keep in mind, that this
is a bit fuzzier matching


386
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,246
than when we're directly
blaming someone.


387
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,306
So, expect this email to go out
to a bit of a wider audience.


388
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,226
It casts a very wide net
when trying to figure


389
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:58,976
out who might be of interest
for a particular issue.


390
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,706
Now, that's great for issues
that come up in your code,


391
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,256
but sometimes, you can
actually get issues that come


392
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,136
up regardless of code changes.


393
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:11,756
One of the easiest ways
to see that is actually


394
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,916
by reconfiguring your bot.


395
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:18,616
So, Xcode 8 or Xcode Server in
Xcode 8 will now track changes


396
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,966
to your bot configuration
and actually call those out.


397
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,546
Whenever possible, we will
attribute any new issues


398
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,746
that come up to changes
in the configuration,


399
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,786
such as if you enable testing
or enable static analysis.


400
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,426
Those types of issues may have
been in your code forever,


401
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,816
but we can actually attribute
them specifically to changes


402
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,796
in the configuration
of the bot rather


403
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:37,766
than a change in your code.


404
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:41,326
We also make sure to include
this information in emails


405
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,306
for the next integration,
so that when you do see one


406
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,476
of these emails, you know that
some of these changes might be


407
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,456
because you're picking up
a configuration change.


408
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,106
Let's go back to something
we were talking about earlier


409
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,906
of installing a new
Xcode and getting a bunch


410
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,456
of new features in the process.


411
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:58,826
Well, when that happens,
Xcode Server


412
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:02,036
on Xcode 8 will actually
reintegrate your entire project,


413
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,106
and we call this an
upgrade integration.


414
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,756
We take the exact same revision
of the previous integration


415
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,756
of all your repositories and
simply rerun all your tests,


416
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,926
rebuild everything, rerun
the static analyzer,


417
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,886
and when this happens, we
know that the issues that come


418
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:19,686
up in your project at this
point, any new issues,


419
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,206
are specifically
because of the upgrade


420
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:23,056
since we took the exact
same commits as before.


421
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,256
This saves you a ton of time
trying to track down changes


422
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:27,896
in your source code
that just aren't there


423
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:32,946
because the issues came up
from changes around your code.


424
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,276
So, that's some of the new
features and issues and blame,


425
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,446
but I want to talk a little bit
about my favorite new feature


426
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:40,136
in Xcode Server and
Xcode 8 which is our new,


427
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:41,816
configurable integration user.


428
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:44,536
So, we now give you full control


429
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,086
of the macOS user that's
running your integrations.


430
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,516
And this gives you a lot
of improved visibility


431
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,316
into how your integrations
are being run,


432
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,076
and more to the point,
it allows you


433
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,436
to configure exactly how
your integrations run.


434
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:59,416
Historically, in Xcode Server,
there's a hidden macOS user


435
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,666
that was running all of your
integrations in the background.


436
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,496
You wouldn't have
access to the password,


437
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,186
and you wouldn't be
able to log in as them.


438
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:08,516
This meant that you were
basically getting a stock user


439
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,366
no matter what, and you
couldn't make any changes.


440
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,966
Now, you'll own and
manage this user yourself.


441
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,206
You will be given the password.


442
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,586
This user will be a
completely normal macOS user.


443
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,036
It'll be any user on the system.


444
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,586
Can be anyone you want.


445
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,786
We suggest a new user.


446
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,836
But it will available
at login window,


447
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,166
and it's fast user switching.


448
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,866
So, you can log in to that user.


449
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,816
You will notice you're
running as that user


450
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:35,226
through a menu extra that
shows the Xcode Server


451
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,396
integration icon.


452
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:37,996
We'll see that in just a minute.


453
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:39,886
Let's go over how you
would set up this user.


454
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:42,936
So, here I've opened the server
app to the Xcode service pane,


455
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,586
and in order to enable
the Xcode Server,


456
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,326
I need to go ahead
and choose an Xcode.


457
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,306
So, I'll choose a new Xcode
8 that I have installed,


458
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,466
and I'll be presented with
this dialog, asking me to set


459
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,066
up which integration user I
want to use, and I'm going


460
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,506
to go ahead and create
a new user just


461
00:24:57,506 --> 00:24:58,386
for running integrations.


462
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,516
I'll go ahead and give it a name


463
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:02,526
and a password, normal
user stuff.


464
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,496
And I'm going to leave
it as a basic user.


465
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:09,326
And when I push "create user,"
Xcode's going to go ahead


466
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:10,256
and do a little bit of work


467
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,526
in the background while
it gets everything ready


468
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:15,956
to run integrations, and once
that user's mostly set up,


469
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,816
we're going to be
asked to login as them.


470
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:20,366
Now, we are asked to log in
as them because we're going


471
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,946
to go ahead and run a little
bit of the setup assistant.


472
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:25,426
Remember, it is a real,
normal macOS user.


473
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:27,596
So I can log in, I can sign


474
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,656
into a test iCloud
account, for example.


475
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:33,076
I can stage any data that I want
to have for my integrations.


476
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,066
Anything like that.


477
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:35,966
When Xcode's ready
to run integrations,


478
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,716
you will see a notification
like the one you see


479
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:40,546
in the top right here, and in
the top right in the menu bar,


480
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:42,976
you'll notice that there is
a little hammer indicating


481
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,506
that this is the Xcode
Server integration user.


482
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:51,226
With that all done, I can
go ahead and switch back,


483
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,346
and I'll be back in server app,
and I'll have the indication


484
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:58,306
that the user is ready
to go, logged in,


485
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,946
and integrations
can begin running.


486
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,246
So, now, we've seen how
to set up that user.


487
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:04,676
Let's take a look at some of
the things that we can do now


488
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,496
that we have access to
the integration user.


489
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,476
And for that, let's go
to the demo machine.


490
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:09,036
All right.


491
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,926
Here we have that same
project we saw earlier,


492
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:14,316
and we saw an issue
where it was crashing


493
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:16,896
because it didn't have
access to location.


494
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,806
And we had to go in
manually to the simulator


495
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,156
and turn off location
access to test it locally.


496
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:22,986
But, as we're developing
our application,


497
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:24,036
we might not want to do that.


498
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:25,856
We probably want to leave
location services turned


499
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,236
on on our Apple TVs
and on our simulators,


500
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,546
so that we're running,
more or less, the way most


501
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,616
of our users will see it and
how we want to see the app.


502
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:35,736
But, now that we've fixed
the issue we saw earlier,


503
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:37,066
we definitely don't want
it to come up again,


504
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,896
and we want to be
notified if it does.


505
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,386
So, it just so happens that
this machine I'm actually


506
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,486
on right now, happens
to be my server machine.


507
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,396
So, I don't have to go
anywhere to go to my server.


508
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,946
I can actually just go to
the fast user switching menu,


509
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,996
and I see that have a
configurable, continue,


510
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:54,936
integration user
called Xcode Server.


511
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,076
And I'm just going to
go ahead and select that


512
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:01,456
and enter my super-secret
password that's only four


513
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,456
characters long.


514
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:06,956
And we will log in as this user.


515
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,306
So, I've gone ahead and
changed the desktop background


516
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,916
so that I know that it's
the build service user.


517
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:15,316
And, here we see the hammer
icon of Xcode that indicates


518
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,526
that this is Xcode Server.


519
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:18,336
We see it's on and
waiting for integrations.


520
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:19,756
So, it's all configured,


521
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,446
but I want to go ahead
and go into Xcode.


522
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:25,566
So, I can actually configure any
settings I want in Xcode locally


523
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,176
on this user, and they will be
picked up in my integrations.


524
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:30,456
So, I'm going to use
a neat little trick.


525
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,756
If I go to the devices
menu, I see all the devices


526
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:36,156
and simulators that are plugged
into this particular machine.


527
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,856
Now, being generous at
Apple, we give you one


528
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,626
of every device we've ever
made, but if that's not enough


529
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,766
for you, for absolutely free,
you can get more simulators just


530
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,966
by clicking this
Plus [+] button.


531
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,586
Now, the Apple TV 1080p
simulator's the built in one


532
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,196
that I got when I
installed Xcode.


533
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:54,246
I've gone ahead and created
another one called Apple TV no


534
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:56,796
location, and I've
actually got it booted here.


535
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,406
And if I go in, I can double
check, and it is, indeed,


536
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:04,006
has location services
turned off.


537
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:07,606
So, I go to settings,
general, privacy.


538
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:09,386
Location services is turned off.


539
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:11,206
So, this simulator is
all configured for use,


540
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,686
and my other one's still usable


541
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:14,586
for when I want location
services turned on.


542
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:18,286
Now, let's do a quick
switch back,


543
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,316
and just log back
into my normal user.


544
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,806
Normally, I'd be
walking across the room


545
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,946
to my actual work machine,
so this is a little faster.


546
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,626
And here we see all
the UI tests.


547
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:30,136
Now, I already have a bot that's
integrating this normally,


548
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:31,776
but I want to go
ahead and create a bot


549
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,596
that will integrate
just the case


550
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:34,916
where we don't have
location data.


551
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:37,016
So, I'm going to go
product, create bot,


552
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,206
and use the Harmony no
location scheme on this server.


553
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,046
Going to go ahead and
give it location, sorry,


554
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:46,336
access to my repository so
it can check out the project.


555
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,276
I'm going to disable
the archive action


556
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:50,816
because this will be the
same as my normal bot.


557
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,736
So, I don't care about that,
but I do want to run tests.


558
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:54,926
And, let's leave
static analysis on.


559
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,886
And I want to be notified
as soon as I break this,


560
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,646
but probably once a
day is good enough.


561
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:03,726
So, I'll know within 24 hours
if we ever break this again,


562
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:05,346
our UI test will catch
it on our server.


563
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,896
So, we'll just run it every
day at 1:00 AM, and here I get


564
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:09,916
to select the devices.


565
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:14,086
By default, every integration
runs on all devices of that OS.


566
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,886
So, this is a tvOS
project, so it'll run


567
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,886
on all tvOS devices
and simulators.


568
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:21,656
Instead, let's do specific TV
devices, and I'm just going


569
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,116
to select the Apple
TV no location.


570
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,546
This is that environment
variable view we talked


571
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:27,106
about earlier.


572
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:28,976
I don't have any
environment variables I need.


573
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,136
I'm going to go ahead and
make sure that I get emailed


574
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,206
when a new issue comes up
in this particular case,


575
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,986
and go ahead and create the bot.


576
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,396
So, that is going to go ahead
and kick off an integration


577
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:40,536
which we see running here.


578
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:41,756
It's checking out building.


579
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,166
We've already seen the
UI test run a little bit,


580
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,966
so let's actually
look at an integration


581
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,846
that I prebaked a
little bit earlier.


582
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,066
And if we go to the test,


583
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,816
we can see that it did run all
our tests including this zip


584
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:52,426
code test.


585
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,166
And we can see, if I look at
some of the screenshots from it,


586
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,466
it is, indeed, running without
location because it's opening


587
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:01,766
that ViewController
that we saw earlier.


588
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:03,566
So, we saw how you were able


589
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,586
to get significantly
improved visibility


590
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:06,796
into how your user runs.


591
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:10,946
You can log in as them and see
everything that's happening.


592
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,986
We saw how you could
customize different settings


593
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:16,486
such as simulators to run
exactly the operations


594
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:17,846
that you want to run
on your integrations.


595
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,706
We saw this was a
completely normal macOS user


596
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,796
that I was able to switch
to in fast user switching


597
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,106
and that I had the password to.


598
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,326
And, we got to see
that menu extra


599
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,446
that shows you a little bit
of your integration status


600
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:31,656
in that integration user.


601
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:34,896
Now, with this great new
power comes a little bit


602
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,116
of responsibility, and so
we have some best practices


603
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:37,446
for you.


604
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,166
First, we highly recommend
you dedicate a new user.


605
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:42,776
You want this to be as similar
to your customer's experience


606
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,606
as possible, so you don't
want all your settings


607
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,516
to be causing impact
on your bots.


608
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,126
We also recommend you avoid
administrator accounts.


609
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,346
Keep in mind that anyone
who can create or edit bots


610
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:55,206
on your serve will have
access to this account


611
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:57,036
through triggers, so
this goes the same


612
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,616
for any private or
customer data.


613
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,486
Try to avoid storing
that in this user.


614
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,726
If you want to stay logged in
as this user in the background,


615
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:05,926
use fast user switching.


616
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:07,266
Integrations can continue to run


617
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,846
in the background just
as they always have.


618
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,006
However, if you do want
to run the integrations


619
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:13,006
as the front most user,


620
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,786
make sure that you
turn off screen lock.


621
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,616
Just like iOS screen
lock blocks testing,


622
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,886
so does macOS screen lock.


623
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,686
And finally, make
sure to customize this


624
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:21,896
for whatever needs you have.


625
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,496
That includes, as we saw
earlier, any simulators.


626
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,496
If you have any specific
networking configuration


627
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:27,716
that you need for
your integrations,


628
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,196
any stage user data or settings
that you want for UI tests,


629
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:33,416
go ahead and configure those.


630
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,266
And finally, if you have
any advanced provisioning,


631
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,656
such as if your administrator
gives you a provisioning


632
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:40,816
profile, however you
would configure on Xcode,


633
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,646
you can actually configure


634
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,686
that in your configurable
integrations user, now,


635
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,076
and make sure that code
signing will work for you.


636
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,846
So, with that, I'm going to
bring Zoltan back to talk


637
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,836
about some new features
in xcodebuild.


638
00:31:53,516 --> 00:32:00,516dle
[ Applause ]


639
00:31:53,516 --> 00:32:00,516
[ Applause ]


640
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:01,566
>> Thank you, Eric.


641
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:07,936
So, you've seen new features
in Xcode and Xcode Server,


642
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,866
and now we have new features
to show you in xcodebuild.


643
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,136
xcodebuild has the test action


644
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:18,696
for custom continuous
integration systems.


645
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,076
You give it a workspace, a
scheme, and a destination,


646
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,426
and xcodebuild will
dutifully build your sources.


647
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:30,026
It will install built products
onto devices as needed.


648
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,466
It will run your tests,
and then report results


649
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:35,766
to you on the command line.


650
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:41,866
So, this year, we're introducing
two new options for this action.


651
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,646
With the only testing option,


652
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,906
you can effectively
constrain the set of tests


653
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,656
that the action will run.


654
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:57,666
So, you can specify TestCases or
TestSuites or TestBundles to run


655
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,306
to the exclusion of other tests.


656
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:04,426
And you can also use
the skip-testing option


657
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:08,286
to specify TestCases to exclude


658
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,466
from the tests while
running everything else.


659
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:14,266
And the big news this year is


660
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,056
that we're introducing two
new actions to xcodebuild.


661
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:21,576
So, we're effectively splitting
the test action in two.


662
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:26,916
These actions are already
available in the Xcode IDE,


663
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:29,846
but we're going to bring
them to xcodebuild, now.


664
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,306
And so, we'll look
at each in turn.


665
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:38,176
Build for testing is just
the building portions


666
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:39,286
of the test action.


667
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:44,266
So, you give it a workspace,
a scheme, and a destination


668
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:48,026
as before, and it will
build your sources,


669
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,766
perhaps making certain
symbols visible,


670
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,676
and then it will output the
built products to derive data.


671
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,396
It also produces
this xctestrun file.


672
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,916
It's a kind of manifest


673
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,626
for everything your
test needs to run.


674
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:04,306
We'll come back to
that in a minute.


675
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:10,315
Test without building then, is
the second part to the story.


676
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,116
You give it a workspace,
a scheme,


677
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,676
and a destination, as before.


678
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:20,166
And, xcodebuild will find the
build products in derived data.


679
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,085
It will install those
onto devices as needed,


680
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:26,976
and then run your tests and
report results just as before.


681
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,666
But the cool thing
is, you no longer need


682
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,056
to provide a workspace.


683
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,545
Instead, you can just
provide this xctestrun file,


684
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:47,196
and Xcode will run your
tests from binaries alone.


685
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,186
So, it will ingest
the xctestrun file.


686
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:54,266
It will find binary products
relative to that file,


687
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,856
and then it will run the
tests and report results


688
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:00,166
in exactly the same
way as before


689
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,896
but without having any
access to your sources.


690
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,576
So, this is ideal


691
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:07,516
for distributed testing
environments.


692
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:12,186
You would build your tests
on machines up to optimized


693
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:16,396
for building, and then
move those built products


694
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:19,036
onto machines optimized
for testing.


695
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:24,366
And then, in parallel, you
can gather the test reports.


696
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,726
So, this is all made possible
by the xctestrun file,


697
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:34,386
that manifest for your tests
that specifies which tests


698
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:37,076
to run and which to skip
and which test machines.


699
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,036
It provides environment
variables


700
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,266
and command line
arguments to your tests,


701
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:44,676
and you can read
more about the format


702
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:49,856
in our man pages
using this command.

704
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:59,906
So, we covered a
lot of ground today.


705
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:03,856
We first reviewed testing in
terms of these four characters,


706
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:08,796
and then we looked at some
new concepts in Xcode.


707
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:12,626
They were great for diagnosing
issues with your tests,


708
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:16,456
and then we introduced
new features in Xcode,


709
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:19,536
in Xcode Server,
and in xcodebuild.


710
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:25,436
I hope these insights and
these new features help you


711
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:28,226
to develop test suites which
perform well, and, after all,


712
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,786
that will help you
deliver great applications.


713
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:36,586

this session at this URL.


714
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:37,976
Thank you.
